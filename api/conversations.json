Emperor Kruzak: They were usually travelling on contract, doing questionable missions and only returned to Kazordoon to boast about their made-up exploits and to spend their ill-begotten money with both hands. ...","This impressed certain people and gained him an undeserved reputation as a daring hero. ...","Though no week they were in town passed without one of them getting imprisoned for brawls, threats and destruction of property, especially younger dwarfs thought it would be cool to be one of them, and if not respected, then at least be feared. ...","When the blight struck, his easy explanations and pointless accusations stroke a cord in the minds of several individuals. I admit we did not see this coming and let him spread his phrases in the city. ...","We had other things to do and did not want more unrest by arresting some popular figure. With our attention elsewhere, Bilespit took advantage of the desperate and lured them into his ranks. ...","He was never the subtle type though, so it became quite clear what unspeakable treason he planed. ...","When he led his bunch of mercenaries and several drunks as some kind of meat-shield to dethrone me, we were prepared. We planned to take Bilespit down first to minimize casualties, but things got out of hand and there were many deaths on both sides. ...","With the order to keep presumably innocent casualties low, my guards fought very restricted, which could have led to their losing the battle. So we had to change orders to reduce our own casualties, and the fight turned very bloody and nasty. ...","Rumours spread through the city and others who thought they sympathized with Bilespit's cause joined the battles. ...","Still, we tried to keep casualties low; and as soon as we took certain strategic positions and gained the upper hand, most of the rebellious forces escaped. ...","Now they are hiding in the mine: Most of those mines are old and depleted of ore.

She plummeted down, right above Marapur and landed in the Stardance Mountains. Hurt and alone, she didn't know how to get back up into the sky. ...","And the stars missed her bitterly. Moon and stars shed many tears and mourned many nights - dark nights, without Amati's light in the sky. But then the stars decided to do something they had never done before: ...","They descended from the sky and surrounded the fallen moon. Here, in these mountains, they began a magical dance. And lo and behold, Amati was healed and, with the help of the stars, was able to rise into the sky again. ...","This is why the mountains in the centre of Marapur are called the Stardance Mountains and our city Moonfall.

This is easier said than done though as the cake regenerates itself periodically with the help of magic. ...","So we only have a few minutes to eat a whole layer of the cake, only then it will not regenerate but the upper layer will come down. So layer for layer we have to eat that cake. ...","It will take an army of hungry Tibians to eat them all in time. Even then things have to be somewhat coordinated. ...","People have to be brought here, wait for their turn to eat and of course stay hungry. Eating another layer might prove futile if you do not wait a few minutes for the hunger to return. ...","The good thing is that all people, big and small, can participate. ...","I guess the isle had a nice and flashy name in the past.

It is good to see you again, well and healthy."]},{"prompt":"ascension","answer":["Ascension is a fascinating topic that dates back to efforts and philosophies of some of the most ancient, and mostly extinct, races which fought in the godwars. ...","Probably born out of desperation, they extensively researched ways to acquire godhood themselves. ...","Some of them at least even met with moderate success. But the process is complicated at best, and may vary from race to race or even from one individual to another. ...","The theories differ vastly and waxed and waned in popularity over the centuries if not aeons. Even today and in human society there are a number of obscure ascension cults. ...","Some of them claim that humans are most suitable for ascension because they already own a bit of divinity through Banor's godly spark."]},{"prompt":"ferumbras","answer":["Although already powerful in his own right, it is obvious that his ultimate goal seems to be the ascension to godly powers. ...","His whole existence seems to be centred on becoming a name that strikes fear into the heart of men and to become a persistent figure in the minds of humanity. ...","This gives him a hold in reality and a kind of mould to fill with his power and conscience. It's also obvious that this kind of belief of the people alone won't be enough to empower him sufficiently. ...","Therefore he has to tap into other, probably even more sinister power sources. I can't tell what these sources are, but my scrying revealed that he has reached massive amounts of power. He has probably been infusing himself since years. ...","By now he is apparently reaching the end circle of his ascension and could make his final move any day."]},{"prompt":"banor","answer":["Ascensionists claim that Banor's spark is in everyone of us. Therefore we are, for a very small part, gods ourselves. Now some argue that this spark could be stolen and fused with another. ...","So if someone were to steal enough sparks, he would become more and more godlike. ...","Usually, such theories lead to violent cults and bloodshed, some going so far as to claim that the last human in existence will have accumulated so much power that he will become a god."]},{"prompt":"gods","answer":["My research on ascension lead to more question about the nature of gods than it provided answers. They are beings or entities of vast powers, but removed from the world. ...","It is unimaginable that something so mortal, short-lived and powerless as a human being might gain their true attention. The chances to gain a god's attention, or even to become of importance to him, are as good as non-existent. ...","You might call yourself lucky if a god recognises the existence of your own race as a whole but that's it."]},{"prompt":"godbreaker","answer":["For a long time, I thought the godbreaker to be some apocryphal myth. But apparently others had learned about the godbreaker in the aeons past and lusted for its power. ...","They had gathered hint after hint - until, ultimately, they were squashed by the Seven or their minions; which only made the leads that hinted at them all the more probable. ...","What Zathroth hoped to accomplish with the creation of such a weapon can only be subject to speculation. Assumedly he already had slain Tibiasula, so the godbreaker might have been even more powerful, more absolute. ...","However, it has to be assumed that in the end the sheer power of his creation scared Zathroth, who had to fear the weapon could one day be used against him. So he disassembled it. ...","He kept the parts hidden and guarded, and if the resources can be trusted and my interpretation is right, moved them again and again, never satisfied with a hiding place. In the end he entrusted the parts to the Ruthless Seven. ...","Knowing that they would never, ever allow one of their own to come in possession of all parts. Since then, the parts have been hidden in a demi-plane shared by the Seven."]},{"prompt":"Ruthless Seven","answer":["Given the internal power plays amongst the Seven, they are the ideal keepers for individual parts of an powerful artefact.

In the course of my latest studies about ascension, I stumbled upon disturbing facts about the person of the all to well known Ferumbras, the fiendish. ...","He obviously had taken an interest to the topic of ascension, and I came into possession of some of his early writings. ...","This, combined with investigation and divination, bit by bit led to the conclusion that all that Ferumbras has done in the past may be part of a cunning plan. ...","Considering his writings and the books he based them upon, it became clear that Ferumbras is planning his ascension to godlike status. ...","All of his attacks and defeats only served one purpose: to become an integral part of the people's knowledge, fears and beliefs. ...","He actually used this as an energy source, and combined it with some sources of power which might not all be of our own world. ...","He uses this energy to increasingly empower himself and will eventually be prepared to take the final step to transform himself into a godlike being. ...","He uses his public awareness to anchor himself and bides his time to infuse himself with power, step by step. ...","With the knowledge what to look for, I acquired expensive but powerful artefacts to scry the world for the expected power signature - and indeed I made contact. ...","To my horror I had to recognise that Ferumbras had already made significant progress, and his final bid for ascension is imminent! ...","His power levels are already too high for there to be any hope of stopping him with conventional means. ...","But not all is lost yet. During my studies about godhood, I learned that the dark Zathroth himself had created a weapon so powerful that it could actually slay a god. ...","Yet even he deemed this so-called 'godbreaker' too dangerous, and split it into seven parts. These were at some point entrusted to his powerful minions, known as the Ruthless Seven. ...","Ancient, forbidden texts hinted at a hellish place where the seven built deadly dungeons, and placed some of their most fearsome and terrible minions as guards, before they sealed the place off. ...","I'm confident that I can prepare a matching ritual that will breach their protection and allow someone to enter their realm; but I'm in no way suited to handle the horrors to be encountered there."]},{"prompt":"Zathroth / Uman","answer":["Uman-Zathroth was once revered like the other gods.

Have you found a new Tome of Knowledge for me to read?"]},{"prompt":"steppe","answer":["Maybe you don't know that the great steppe was once a fertile ground. Well, to be precise - in the distant past it probably did not look any different from what it looks today. ...","But when the lizard civilisation was at its peak, they apparently developed advanced irrigation systems to water the steppe and used this area as a major source for their supplies on rice and other food. ...","Back in those times, the lizard population was immense and their need of supplies tremendous. Therefore, they did not allow other races to co-exist and exterminated most of them almost completely. ...","Some relics of the settlements of the pre-lizard cultures can still be found. Most of them were probably converted by the victorious lizardmen into something that suited their purposes better. ...","All that talk about relics reminds me about something I've recently seen when getting some fresh air up in the mountains. Right next to the carpet pilot - may earth protect me from ever having to step on that thing - was an old lizard relic. ...","Incredible how far their realm might have stretched at the peak of their civilisation!

It is obvious from the books that the draken appeared only after the dragon kings revealed themselves to the lizards. ...","It is specifically mentioned that the tide of the battle turned when they joined the army of the lizards. Parts of the tome were obviously erased and later overwritten. ...","In the parts of the original text that I was able to reconstruct with the help of some alchemy, there were some references to lizard spawns that were sighted in the Tiquanda area and linked to the snake god. ...","Admittedly, it is just a hypothesis that is based on a few hints in these tomes and my correspondence about serpent spawns with the sage Edowir... ...","...However, considering everything that I could figure out about their origin, they seem to hatch from the same eggs like ordinary lizardmen. ...","It seems that some of those eggs are imbued with spiritual or magical power and as a result bear a serpent spawn. It appears that this changed when the dragon emperor became the ruler of this land. ...","Unlike serpent spawns, the draken hatched from some of the eggs in the hatcheries. ...","I can only imagine what this might imply. As I said, it's only a theory, but I think a quite valid one and I'd treasure any additional information about that topic. ...","In the meantime, I've also talked to Esrik about some information that I found in the tome concerning weaponry and armory. Knowing this dwarf, he might have some interesting offers for you by now."]},{"prompt":"founder","answer":["It seems that some parts of the tome are just copies from other sources and rather unrelated to each other. As far as I could piece them together, there was a mythical founder of the lizard civilisation. ...","His name was Zao and his deeds and exploits are immortalised in lizard folklore. Some of the earliest records in the tomes suggest a slightly different story though. ...","Many records talk about an early lizard dynasty, but I doubt that Zao was a single person born into that dynasty. ...","My guess is that several members of this dynasty are responsible for or connected to the feats that were attributed to the mythical 'Zao'. ...","The improbable lifespan of 'Zao' can thus be explained with the time the Zao dynasty reigned. On the other hand, we all know larger-than-life heroes did exist and some of them had an extremely long lifespan. ...","Most likely, he also had children which could explain the mentioning of a Zao family. I think even the lizardmen don't know for sure what happened in such distant past and so this might be one of those riddles that will never be solved. ...","It seems that the origin of the Zao dynasty was somewhere in the Dragonblaze Peaks, or rather under them. Legends tell of a large fortress, once erected up the highest peak, but now buried deep underground. Who knows, maybe you'll find answers there?"]},{"prompt":"zzaion","answer":["Have you ever seen the towers of the large lizard city south-east of Zao? It's the last one south of the mountains and who knows how long they are able to hold it. ...","It's under constant and heavy siege by the steppe orcs and minotaurs. Sometimes they manage to crush the gates and storm the city. Watch out, you probably don't want to stumble right into the middle of a war. Or maybe you do? ...","Anyway, I found another nice pattern in this book. It's for a lizard carrying device. I've given it to Pompan, just in case you're interested."]},{"prompt":"corruption","answer":["You know, while all this talk about growing and preparing rice might sound boring, there are actually some bits of vital information hidden in all those lists. ...","It seems that not only the loss of the southern area hampered the rice harvest of the lizards. ...","Ever since the dragon kings established their reign, the harvest constantly got worse. And this is not all! It's reported that everything that is growing in this land experienced a fertility decrease. ...","Even the lizards themselves seem to suffer from a population decline. It's widely blamed to a plague that ravaged the land in the past, but that seems unlikely given the fact that also plants and various animals were affected. ...","Additionally, several plants changed in shape and became poisonous or toxic. Also, some new-born lizards seem to be affected by this. ...","According to the descriptions, I'd call them mentally unstable, but their people see them as 'blessed by the dragon emperor'. I assume there are strange forces at work in this land, and I have a bad feeling about it. ...","Anyway, you know what else was mentioned in this book? A path down to a hidden cave system below the Muggy Plains. ...","Apparently, at first this system was used to hide - or rather to get rid of - new-born lizards that carried the sign of corruption - before the lizards decided to view it as a blessing. ...","Who knows what happens down there now - maybe it's worth a look, maybe not. Maybe you won't even discover anything. In any case, be careful."]},{"prompt":"dragons","answer":["Dragons are of great symbolism for this land. Even before the dragons came here and took control over Zao, the lizards worshipped the dragons as strong mythical beasts. ...","When the future dragon kings came here - seemingly from a distant and foreign land - they probably took some advantage of this cult. ...","Another symbol - that of the snake - that must have been much more popular than the dragon, faded into unimportance over the years. ...","I think in the past, the lizardmen of this country might have worshipped a snake god or goddess just like their brethren in Tiquanda if we can believe the reports from this area. The dragons replaced the snake worship at some point of history. ...","The reference to heretics and their extermination suggests that there might have been a rebellion against the dragons, which in turn hints at some close link between lizards and dragons, maybe a forced one. ...","While reading this tome, I discovered a drawing of this beautiful statue. I was a skilled sculptor in the past, so I can't resist. ...","I'm probably not that good anymore, but if you're interested and find me a red lantern, I could make one of those for you."]},{"prompt":"thrones","answer":["In the modern lizard culture thrones seem to be only a reminiscent of the past. Whereas in the past the rulers of the lizardmen used thrones and other insignia to show their status, in our days they are ruled by dragon kings. ...","Those kings seem to be massive dragons of immense power. Of course they do not actually 'use' thrones anymore, but claim them nonetheless as symbol for their position. ...","From what I can tell, the lizards are bound to those dragon kings by some kind of magic. I'm not sure what this magic does, but I guess it ensures their loyalty to some extent. ...","On an interesting side note - there were some hints in the tome that the dragon kings themselves are somehow bound to the dragon emperor through the same kind of magic. ...","It seems this kind of liege system was formed sometime after the arrival of the dragons in this land. It's definitely an interesting field of research and shows us how much we still have to learn and to discover. ...","Well, I've certainly learnt how the great old thrones look like. If you bring me some red cloth, I could probably try and reconstruct one for you."]},{"prompt":"lantern","answer":["Have you brought me a red lantern for a dragon statue?"]},{"prompt":"cloth","answer":["Have you brought me a piece of red cloth?

These mining bases had some obvious advantages and disadvantages. ...","The suitable spots had no connection to the surface.
