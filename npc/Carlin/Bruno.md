Player: Hi
Bruno: Ahoi, Player. You want to buy some fresh fish?
Player: Job
Bruno: My job is to catch fish and to sell them here.
Player: Marlene
Bruno: Ah yes, my lovely wife. God forgive her, but she can't stop talking. So my work is a great rest for my poor ears. *laughs loudly*
Player: Graubart
Bruno: I like this old salt. I learned much from him. Whatever. You like some fish? *grin*
Player: Bye
Bruno: Good bye and come again!
