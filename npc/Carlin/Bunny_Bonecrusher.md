Bunny Bonecrusher: I worship Banor, the first warrior!  
Player: ferumbras  
Bunny Bonecrusher: Believe it or not, I killed him two times with my own bow, but some unholy forces rise him again and again.

Bunny Bonecrusher: I am the general of the queen’s army. I don’t have time to explain this concept to you.  
Player: knights of noodles  
Bunny Bonecrusher: They are rumoured to be skilled fighters. Then again, in the land of the blind…  
Player: report / news  
Bunny Bonecrusher: Our reports are only for internal use.
