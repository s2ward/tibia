Player: hi
Ghostly Wolf: You are speaking the language of animals? I'm surprised. But I'm not in the right mood for a chat.
Player: mood
Ghostly Wolf: I'm heartbroken. My puppies were taken from me ... But as I said, I don't want to talk right now. Please leave me alone.
Player: name
Ghostly Wolf: My name is long forgotten.
Player: job
Ghostly Wolf: I'm a wolf ... or I was one. Now I'm a ghost, haunting this place because I can't find peace.
Player: time
Ghostly Wolf: Time is not important, neither to wolves nor to ghosts.
Player: bye
Ghostly Wolf: Farewell.
