Player: hi  
Salbra: Hi there! Why don't you take a seat? You can't? Always in a hurry, hmm? Anyway, I will have to tell you some things before you really get going. You're going to learn a lot about runes and spells, both for sorcerers and druids. Are you ready?  
Player: ready  
Salbra: Great! There are two types of casting magic: spells and runes. Runes are magic spells stored in special stones. To cast a spell, you need to have learned the spell first. To use a rune, you only need to use the rune. ...  
Salbra: But only DRUIDS and SORCERERS have a high enough MAGIC LEVEL to use spells or runes properly ...  
Salbra: Now, spells, they have to be learned before you can use them. Later on, you will have to find your specific spell teachers, but for now, I know some fine spells to teach you the principle. Ready?  
Player: Ready  
Salbra: First, you need to do this, OK?  
Player: OK  
Salbra: Good. Next, please do this. OK?  
Player: OK  
Salbra: Good, and then, please do this. OK?  
Player: OK  
Salbra: Great! Now you should have a small fire wave spell ready to use. Go and test it on the monsters over there, then come back!  
Player: proceed  
Salbra: Very well, now we'll talk about attack runes, this will be fun! Are you ready?  
Player: ready  
Salbra: Using attack runes is simple: just right-click on the rune. If it's a rune that needs a target like a missile or healing rune, you need to click on the target on the map or battle list afterwards. Other runes need no target ...  
Salbra: Just walk to the counter and see if you can hit the monsters from there.  
Player: proceed  
Salbra: Of course! I will now tell you something about healing yourself. Are you ready?  
Player: ready  
Salbra: That's easy, you have just learned 'exura dis', an easy healing spell. Please do this first, OK?  
Player: OK  
Salbra: Great, now please do this, OK?  
Player: OK  
Salbra: Great, now please do this, OK?  
Player: OK  
Salbra: BAM! Now heal yourself! ...  
Salbra: If it doesn't work, please make sure you have the right settings and enough mana. There's a mana potion in the chest, just in case you need it. ...  
Salbra: It worked, yes?  
Player: yes  
Salbra: Great! You can of course use some healing spells on OTHERS, too. But keep in mind, ONLY A DRUID can HEAL OTHERS with a SPELL. Why would you want this? Well, other players will want to have you in their party if you are a druid! ...  
Salbra: Now that was about all I had to tell you. Please proceed east and then north through the Gate of Initiates! ...  
Salbra: Good luck, and find a vocation that suits your style at the 4 vocation trainers: Sorcerer Estrella, Knight Hykrion, Druid Yandur and Paladin Narai!
