Player: hi  
Salbra: Welcome. Why don't you take a seat? You can't? Always in a hurry, hmm? But I have some things to teach you before you really get going - about runes and spells for sorcerers and druids. ...
Salbra: Are you ready?
Player: ready  
Salbra: Lovely! There are two types of casting magic: spells and runes. Runes are magic spells stored in special stones. To cast a spell, you need to have learned the spell first. To use a rune, you only need to use the rune. ...
Salbra: But only DRUIDS and SORCERERS have a high enough MAGIC LEVEL to use spells or runes properly ...  
Salbra: Now, spells, they have to be learned before you can use them. Later on, you will have to find your specific spell teachers, but for now, I know some fine spells to teach you the principle. Ready?  
Player: Ready  
Salbra: Your new spell can be cast anytime by saying 'exevo dis flam hur'. But I can show you a much more convenient way. First, open your spell list in the general controls menu, OK?
Player: OK  
Salbra: Good. Next, please select the spell 'Practise fire wave'. OK? 
Player: OK  
Salbra: Good. Now, drag and drop this spell onto a hotkey on the quickbar that's underneath your game window. OK?
Player: OK  
Salbra: Great! Now you should have a small fire wave spell ready to use when on the hotkey you chose. Go and test it on the monsters over there, then come back!
Player: proceed  
Salbra: Very well, now we'll talk about attack runes, this will be fun! Are you ready?  
Player: ready  
Salbra: Using attack runes is simple: just right-click on the rune. If it's a rune that needs a target like a missile or healing rune, you need to click on the target on the map or battle list afterwards. Other runes need no target ...  
Salbra: Just walk to the counter and see if you can hit the monsters from there.  
Player: proceed  
Salbra: Of course! I will now tell you something about healing yourself. Are you ready?  
Player: ready  
Salbra: That's easy, you have just learned 'exura dis', an easy healing spell. Now, type in the spell's magic words, 'exura dis', in your chatbar, OK?
Player: OK  
Salbra: Great, you see that works too! And now please select the spell 'exura dis' in your spell list in the general controls menu, OK?
Player: OK  
Salbra: Great, now please drag and drop the spell onto a hotkey on the quickbar that's underneath your game window, OK?
Player: OK
Salbra: BAM! Now heal yourself! ...  
Salbra: If it doesn't work, please make sure you have the right settings and enough mana. There's a mana potion in the chest, just in case you need it. ...  
Salbra: It worked, yes?  
Player: yes  
Salbra: Great! You can of course use some healing spells on OTHERS, too. But keep in mind, ONLY A DRUID can HEAL OTHERS with a SPELL. Why would you want this? Well, other players will want to have you in their party if you are a druid! ...  
Salbra: Now that was about all I had to tell you. Please proceed east and then north through the Gate of Initiates! ...  
Salbra: Good luck, and find a vocation that suits your style at the 4 vocation trainers: Sorcerer Estrella, Knight Hykrion, Druid Yandur and Paladin Narai!  
Player: bye
Salbra: Goodbye.
Player: (vanish)
Salbra: These youngsters. Always in a hurry.
