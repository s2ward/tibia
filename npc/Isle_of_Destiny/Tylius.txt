Player: hi  
Tylius: Hello there! I see you had fun in the close combat tent, that's great! Now, this is the distance fighting tent. In here, you can test staffs that sorcerers and druids use. Want to give it a go? Say yes.
Player: yes
Tylius: Hahah, eager to roast some party skeletons, eh? Still, sorcerer and druids are distance fighters. That means they do NOT touch the monsters. Mainly because their defense and armor is a lot weaker. On the other hand, their damage output is far greater ...
Tylius: You need to find the right distance. If too far away, the staff won't work; if too close, you will receive a heavy beating from the monster. First, EQUIP your new staff in the WEAPON SLOT in your inventory, ...  
Tylius: then RIGHT-CLICK on a monster on the map or battle list and choose 'ATTACK'. ...
Tylius: Ready for the staff?
Player: ready
Tylius: Alright, here you go! Have fun with the staff. Don't forget that you need to drag your staff from the inventory to your weapon slot. If you've had enough, just go to the next tent!
Player: bye
Tylius: <bows> Goodbye. May we meet again!

Player: hi
Tylius: Hello there! Interested in magic? Wish to become an acolyte of the arcane, a neophyte of nature? Then the staff is your weapon of choice! Care to try it out? Of course you do. Say yes.
Player: yes
Tylius: <chuckles> Good. We magic wielders prefer to fight from a distance, as our defense and armor is a lot weaker than that of the knights. But we deal out more damage with a hit than they do. ...
Tylius: Stay at a little distance from a monster. Too far away: the staff won't hit the monster; come too close and the monster will hit YOU. ...
Tylius: First, drag your staff to the weapon slot in your inventory to use it. Then, to attack, RIGHT-CLICK on a monster on the screen or battle list and choose 'ATTACK'. ...
Tylius: Remember that a staff also needs mana to work, so make sure you always have some food, or you won't regenerate mana. There's food in the chest outside, and some blueberry bushes. Oh yes, one other thing: mana will only be regenerated inside tents. ...
Tylius: Ready for the staff?
Player: mana
Tylius: Mana is your magic energy. If you don't have any mana, you can't use any magic - no weapon, no spell. All magic staffs, wands and rods need mana to fire at monsters. So. Ready for a staff?
Player: ready
Tylius: Alright, let's get started! <snaps fingers> Here's your staff! Just drag it from your inventory to your weapon slot to use it. ...
Tylius: <chuckles> Have a blast and just visit Shanoya next door to try out mundane distance weapons, too, afterwards.
Player: name
Tylius: <bows> My name is Tylius. Delighted to make your acquaintance.
Player: sorcerer
Tylius: We are the masters of energy, fire, and death magic. In this tent, I will teach you the basics of wielding a magic staff, our main weapon.
Player: hi
Tylius: Hello again! Do you want me to explain how distance fighting for mages works again, or did you lose your staff?
Player: staff
Tylius: Sorry, only one staff every 5 minutes per initiate permitted! Festival regulations.
Player: again
Tylius: Gladly. We magic wielders prefer to fight from a distance, as our defense and armor is a lot weaker than that of the knights. But we deal out more damage with a hit than they do. ...
Player: (walks away)
Tylius: <chuckles> Always in a hurry, eh?
