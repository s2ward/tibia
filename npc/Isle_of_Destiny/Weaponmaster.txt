Player: hi  
Weaponmaster: Greetings Player! Now that you have your weapon, waste no time and seek out adventure. Farewell!  
Player: hi  
Weaponmaster: Hello Player! I have already heard about you! As our newest member you are eligible to be granted a weapon of your choice!  
Player: choice  
Weaponmaster: You can choose a daramian mace, a steel axe or a jagged sword!  
Player: daramian mace  
Weaponmaster: The first rule of club fighting is: you do not talk about club fighting! But let us ignore this rule for a moment. ...  
Weaponmaster: The daramian mace is obviously used in the mace fighting style. Maces tend to be a bit more defensive then other weapon category. ...  
Weaponmaster: This becomes especially interesting when using two handed weapons without the protection of a shield. So shall the daramian mace become your weapon of choice?  
Player: steel axe  
Weaponmaster: The steel axe suits the style of axe fighters well. Axes tend to be better for attacking then for defense, which becomes most important while using two handed weapons. Do you really want to choose the steel axe as your weapon?  
Player: jagged sword  
Weaponmaster: Sword fighting is a balanced style, not giving up attack power for defense or the other way round. Swords are not as damaging as comparable axes or defensive as comparable maces but does neither share their weaknesses. ...  
Weaponmaster: Do you want to take the jagged sword as your first weapon?  
Player: no
Weaponmaster: Not ready to make your decision just yet? Ah well, you can still choose between a daramian mace, a steel axe or a jagged sword!
Player: yes  
Weaponmasterr: And here it is! Your first weapon of knighthood! May it serve you well. Remember this choice does not restrict you to this weapon type. You can train your weapon skills freely as it pleases you.  
Player: bye  
Weaponmaster: Farewell then, adventurer!
