Player: hi
Balduin The Baker: Hi there Bennie. I guess you are here to assist me in my job!
Player: job / help
Balduin The Baker: I'm a member of the Magic Bakery Alliance. We are an order that is dedicated to further the knowledge of bakery for the benefit of mankind. Our goals are as numerous as the recipes we come up with each season.
Player: goals
Balduin The Baker: Currently we are trying to reclaim another part of Kullu's wisdom. Year after year, we try our best to break the defences of Cake Keep Isle.
Player: Kullu
Balduin The Baker: He was a great mage but an even greater cook. His recipes and spells are priceless. Sadly, even if we succeed in breaking the defences of Cake Keep Isle, we will only manage to decipher a tiny fraction of his knowledge. ...
Balduin The Baker: And still, we don't know what happened to Kullu. He retreated from our world to fully concentrate on his research on cooking recipes and spells. ...
Balduin The Baker: He was some sweet tooth for all that we know. And for sure a genius when it comes to baking and magic. ...
Balduin The Baker: His kitchen magic was that amazing, you could not tell where baking ended and magic started.
Player: keep
Balduin The Baker: To be undisturbed, he placed his keep on an isle that existed on a planar instability which allowed him to phase the isle out of existence for most of the time. ...
Balduin The Baker: Additionally he surrounded the isle with a sorcery of his invention that defied most attempts to reach it. ...
Balduin The Baker: It took us quite a while to figure out that he'd never be able to weave a protection spell against something he loved so dearly like cakes and bakery wares. ...
Balduin The Baker: So we came up with the idea of the bridge.
Player: bridge
Balduin The Baker: After a few failed attempts with gingerbread boats and the like, we figured out how to reach Cake Keep Isle. We used the very ingredients we could derive from his cake golem attacks to build a stable cake bridge to his isle.
Player: golem
Balduin The Baker: Ah well, that's an .. uhm .. funny story. ...
Balduin The Baker: You see, after the first expedition reached the isle, they took so long trying to find a way to Kullu's secrets that the isle began to vanish into the void while they were still there. ...
Balduin The Baker: The entire time, they were harassed by Kullu's cake golem guardians of the keep. In the last minute, they cast emergency teleports to their home cities. ...
Balduin The Baker: The good thing is it was not too late and all escaped. Well, the bad thing is their spells somehow reacted with the void-rift of that place, building astral tunnels from the void to said cities. ...
Balduin The Baker: Now, whenever the isle manifests, the tunnels manifest as well. The ugly part is that through this one-way tunnels the cake golem army that was apparently sucked into the void has access to the cities and can raid them. ...
Balduin The Baker: But they are not only an annoyance but also our greatest chance. Nasty but tasty little buggers. They can be troublesome but we need them for our bridge construction.
Player: chance
Balduin The Baker: The golems that raid the cities supply us with two major materials that we need to build our bridge to Cake Keep Isle. ...
Balduin The Baker: One component is the sugary mass that can be gained if you slay one of them. We use it as a kind of mortar. ...
Balduin The Baker: The second part is a bit trickier to get. It is the raw cake material. It is kind of challenging to gain it. We built extraction machines that can drain the base material from the still animated corpses. ...
Balduin The Baker: We placed one in each of the raided cities. You will have to lure the golems into the machines, to extract the material from them. ...
Balduin The Baker: We need it to have a stable base material that is resilient against wind, weather and salt water.
Player: mass
Balduin The Baker: We accumulated 116 of 200 sugary mass. We can't fail this year! We will not allow it!
Player: base
Balduin The Baker: I'm somewhat worried. Getting the base material is always the tricky part. People are usually a bit too eager to kill. We accumulated 140 of 200 base material until now.
Player: name
Player: bakery
Balduin The Baker: We are a mystic order of bakers who pursue goals for the benefit of all mankind. Don't even listen to the lies and propaganda spread by those who envy us.
Player: lies
Balduin The Baker: Though most of our noble order abandoned the more theoretical studies at the academies, it is an evil lie that we are failed students who know more about drinking and eating than about magic. ...
Balduin The Baker: Once we have revealed all of Kullu's secrets, we will be envied by all. And of course we all will become famous and incredibly rich.
Player: order
Balduin The Baker: We are a mystic baker order. Don't listen to those who envy us and spread ugly lies and propaganda. We are dedicated to uncover the greatest secrets about cooking and baking. ...
Balduin The Baker: Baking is the only trade worth to be considered. Without bakers everyone would starve. We are what ties a society together, preferably with a thick, sticky and sweet mass made of fruits. ...
Balduin The Baker: We are the momentum of culture. Baking is what divides civilization from barbarism.
Player: bye
Balduin The Baker: Good bye.
