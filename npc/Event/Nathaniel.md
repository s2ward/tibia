Player: hi / hello
Nathaniel: Greetings Player! You look like a friend of nature! Oh by the way, I have some news about the contest unless you want to talk about bonus points first!
Player: envelope
Nathaniel: The three wizards dropped these envelopes everywhere in the world. A lot of creatures have been carrying envelopes all over Tibia.
Player: bonus
Nathaniel: You currently have no bonus points to spend. Would you like me to explain the bonus point system or do you want to exchange coloured powders?
Player: exchange / queen / select / luck / chess
Nathaniel: Mh, you are not of green colour. Either you did not join a wizard yet or – the unthinkable – you joined a different colour than green! You can only claim a reward from me once you have joined the green wizard.
Player: explain
Nathaniel: Alright. Shall I talk about the collecting points or your rewards for exchanging points? Or do you ask yourself why Zaoan chess?
Player: fan
Nathaniel: There are two others like me, an orange fan in Carlin and some girl for violet in Thais. Trust me green is the colour to go… but hey, you can always check out the others.
Player: fern
Nathaniel: Fern is the wizard of Nature. Behold his powers and the elemental might that is nature itself.
Player: furb / fun / orange / violer / spend

Player: green / colour
Nathaniel: Green is my colour. It is what I stand for. Green represents the wizard Fern of Nature of which I am a great fan.
Player: job
Nathaniel: I am a fan and want to inform other Tibians about the BEST colour to join, the best wizard, the great CAUSE! NATURE! Wizard Fern, whose colour is green of course!
Player: join

Player: status
Nathaniel: Violet seems to be the winning colour at the moment. Green is the runner-up.
Player: tibianus
Nathaniel: I wonder what colour he chose…
Player: wizard / contest
Nathaniel: There are 3 wizards. Each of them represents a different element which can be easily identified by a unique colour. …
Nathaniel: There is ‘orange’ for wizard Furb of Fun, ‘green’ for wizard Fern of Nature and ‘violet’ for wizard Feiz of Power.
Player: Zaoan
Nathaniel: Well, it’s a long story. It has a lot to do with wizardry, a little with chess and quite much with a lady. I know that there must be a book about it, somewhere in a library in Thais.
Player: bye
Nathaniel: Farewell friend.
