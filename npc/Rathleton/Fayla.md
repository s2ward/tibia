Fayla: <smiles> Yes, dear? Do you want to buy something?
Player: yes
Fayla: <smiles> Well then, just ask for a trade and have a look!
Player: job
Fayla: During office hours, I sell instruments. In the evenings and by appointment, I teach how to sing and to play an instrument.
Player: teach
Player: lesson
Fayla: Not everyone here can afford his or her own instrument, and I enjoy music. So I made it my duty to teach all who strive to sing and play. After all, music is there to be shared.
Player: singer / opera
Fayla: Ah, so you heard of me? Well, a lot of time has passed since then, my dear. Glorious days, but it doesn’t do to repine, does it? Of course it doesn’t. <smiles> …
Fayla: Now, how about a nice little instrument for your home? Just ask me for a trade and I’ll set you right up.
Player: wooden / flute
Fayla: That was a gift from a very mighty and noble friend. Ah, I could never part with it!
Player: sell / buy / instrument / music
Fayla: I sell only the finest instruments, if you are interested in a trade.
Player: city / Rathleton
Fayla: This is an …interesting city, as I am sure you have already noticed. I believe you know glooth?
