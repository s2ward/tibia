Player: Hi
Silas: Hello, friend. If you need bows or spears, ammunition or paladin spells, then ask for a trade.
Player: Job
Silas: I am a hunter and trainer of hunters. And I teach paladin spells to those of my kind.
Player: Rathleton
Silas: You seem staggered by it. The invention of glooth added to the uniqueness of our city, I believe - there is no glooth in your lands, I understand?
Player: Glooth
Silas: A strange substance, gained, I think through some sort of process from an animal. Our historian in the magistrate, or Dr Alaistar Stanton, can surely explain it better to you than I can.
Player: Alaistar
Silas: A kind and intelligent man, but too naive in his dealings with the minotaurs. You'd better purchase some sturdy bow if you go out there to their camps, friend.
Player: Minotaurs
Silas: Those brutish creatures cannot share the island with us. We should eradicate their kind, once and for all, or we shall never be safe.
