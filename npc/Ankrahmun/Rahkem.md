JogadOr: hi
Rahkem: Be mourned pilgrim in flesh. How can I help you, <nome do player>? I'm a healer and also teach druid spells.
Player: Job
Rahkem: I am a humble preacher of the true revelation in the temple of the mourned flesh. I heal and teach magic spells to those who are spiritual enough.
Player: Temple
Rahkem: Here we mourn our mortal existence. Our flesh is our weakness and our curse, the bait for all the trials and tribulations the false gods let loose on the world.
Player: Mourned / Mourn
Rahkem: We mortals are all to be mourned for our prison of flesh. Only through loyal servitude to the pharaoh, praised be his existence, may we escape this prison and find our true destiny.
Player: Pharaoh
Rahkem: Our immortal ruler, may he be blessed, is the keeper of our enlightenment and our saviour.
Player: False Gods
Rahkem: The so-called gods are just the weakest of their kind. They are pitiful remnants from the terrible godswar between the elder gods which tore the universe apart.
Player: Godswar
Rahkem: In ancient times the elder gods waged war upon each other. Those that call themselves gods today were the lowest of their minions. When the last of the true gods died the great suffering began.
Player: Great Suffering
Rahkem: The universe is dying. Death placed his mark on everything. Only the pharaoh can grant us freedom from mortality and open up the path of true ascension to us.
Player: Ascension
Rahkem: The sentient beings are all that is left of the essence of the elder gods. We can awake the dormant powers that slumber in us all. But ascension is a thorny path to follow.
Player: Thorny Path
Rahkem: Our mortal shells make us vulnerable to the temptations of the false gods. Only by leaving our mortality behind, we can study the true path of ascension. The balance of Akh'rah Uthun has to be changed to our favour.
Player: Mortality
Rahkem: Mortality is our prison. It makes us vulnerable to the temptations of the false gods.
Player: Akh'rah Uthun
Rahkem: The Akh'rah Uthun is the unity of the Akh, our body, the Rah, our soul and the Uthun, our memories and experiences.
Player: Akh
Rahkem: Your flesh is traitorous and weak. The pharaoh grants the power to conquer death to those who serve him well. Once they have entered this state of being neither dead nor alive they are ready to enter the path of ascension.
Player: Rah
Rahkem: The Rah is the ultimate treasure. The false gods need the stolen Rah to sustain their usurped powers.
Player: Uthun
Rahkem: The memory is what makes our personality. It is what defines us ... and its utterly worthless to the gods. For this reason destroy it to harvest our Rah.
Player: Arena
Rahkem: The arena is a fitting place to test your mortal shell and to feed the power of the Rah and the Uthun.
Player: Palace
Rahkem: The residence of our immortal king is a temple in its own right because it is the home of a true god.
Player: Scarabs
Rahkem: The eternal burrowers are the keepers of all the secrets their kind has unearthed in countless aeons.
Player: Daraman
Rahkem: The continent was named after Daraman, the prophet during the reign of Ashmunrah. The new pharaoh acknowledged the power that is in names and did not change the name when he acceded to the throne.
Player: Ashmunrah
Rahkem: The foolish old pharaoh withheld knowledge and power from his son, knowing that he would surpass him in every aspect. But in his infinite mercy his son granted him the chance to ascend.
Player: Undeath
Rahkem: Undeath is freedom from mortal needs. It is the first obvious step to divinity.
Player: Kazordoon
Rahkem: The dwarves suffered, but they have drawn wrong conclusions. If they do not listen to the revelations of our immortal pharaoh, pain and grief will prove to be better teachers this time.
Player: Tibia
Rahkem: It is likely that our world is a part of one of the dead true gods or one of their manifestations that somehow escaped destruction. We must assume this is all that is left of the original universe.
Player: Bye
Rahkem: May enlightenment be your path, Player.
