Player: Hi
Thorwulf: Hi Player.
Player: Name
Thorwulf: I am Thorwulf, slayer of dragons, giants and yetis.
Player: Dragon
Thorwulf: The dragons of these lands are fierce as a blizzard and lethal as the silent cold and the howling snow storm alike.
Player: Yeti
Thorwulf: The yetis are powerful and cunning foes. It takes the right bait to lure them out of their hiding places.
Player: Bait
Thorwulf: I won't tell. Never ever. Find out on your own.
Player: Job
Thorwulf: I am an expert fighter and I can teach a true warrior in the arts of war.
Player: Mission / task
Thorwulf: I don't have anything to do for you.
Player: King
Thorwulf: How can someone who never proved himself as a warrior lead people into a battle?
Player: Queen
Thorwulf: The people from Carlin seem to respect their queen. Though, I can't understand why. She is hardly a warrior.
Player: Gods
Thorwulf: I couldn't care less for gods. Every true warrior creates his own fortune.
Player: Spells
Thorwulf: Sorry, I don't teach spells for your vocation.
Player: Druids
Thorwulf: As far as I understood it, druids are like our shamans. I know enough magic to defeat my opponents on my own. So I have only little use for such spell casters
Player: Shamans
Thorwulf: All they are doing is talking to the spirits the whole day. My enemies, however, are of flesh and blood and I can handle them on my own.
Player: Ferumbras
Thorwulf: Bah, to know that he is a sorcerer means to know that he is a coward.
Player: Excalibug
Thorwulf: A true warrior will kill his opponents with a rusty knife. There is no need for a mighty weapon. Where is the honour if the weapon is more powerful than its wielder?
Player: News
Thorwulf: There are no news ... yet. But I can smell blood and steel in the air. I can feel it, there is going to be a battle soon.
Player: Carlin
Thorwulf: I care little for the people from Carlin. All of them are so weak and timid. I could not care less for their concerns. If they want something to be done, they will have to do it on their own.
Player: Edron / port Hope
Thorwulf: Some far away place the people of Carlin talk about now and then.
Player: Svargrond
Thorwulf: I hate it to wait here for our enemies to arrive. I'd rather go out and wage war in their camps and lairs.
Player: Thais
Thorwulf: Thais is not better than Carlin.
Player: Venore
Thorwulf: For all I know, they are schemers and liars. That means they are even worse than the other southerners.
Player: Dwarf
Thorwulf: I haven't seen many of them around here.
Player: Elf
Thorwulf: The elves that came here were quite skilled with a bow. I respect that in a way, still it takes little courage to shoot something from afar.
Player: Chakoya
Thorwulf: The chakoyas are small but their teeth can shred a man's arm into pieces. Their strength lies in their number as well as in ambushes on unwary or sleeping persons.
Player: Cult
Thorwulf: I don't care about cults.
Player: Jarl
Thorwulf: Our jarl has grown old. I honour him for his deeds in the past but I wonder if a younger leader wouldn't be better now. He could lead us into glorious battles with the raiders.
Player: Raiders
Thorwulf: Their cowardly tactics are a shame for every true barbarian, so is their obedience to a witch. They are not even worthy opponents.
Player: Barbarian
Thorwulf: Most people have forgotten that being a true barbarian means to be a fearless fighter.
Player: Mines
Thorwulf: Those Carliners seem to care about those mines, but they don't have the guts to recapture them. Pathetic.
Player: Chyll
Thorwulf: The wind that has seen all battles and that puts an icy blanket over the battlefields.
Player: Nibelor
Thorwulf: A boring piece of ice and rock on which only shamans live.
Player: Years of Serpents
Thorwulf: Men are not supposed to travel the seas. So I don't care if these giant serpents ever existed or if they had only been an excuse for cowards.
Player: How are you?
Thorwulf: As long as I am not fighting, I am bored.
Player: Rumours
Thorwulf: A few years ago there was an arena fighter named Alrik. He managed to win the Warlord title three times in a row. He was Svargrond's greatest hero and all of a sudden he was gone and never seen again. ...
Thorwulf: Even his sculpture disappeared. The people say Chyll took him directly to Everspring where he could live a king's life as a reward.
Player: Coward
Thorwulf: You talked to Robert, did you? I think I scared him pretty well! Hehehe!
Player: Bye
Thorwulf: Bye Player.
