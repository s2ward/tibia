Player: Job
Sirik: It's my duty to protect Svargrond and its citizens.
Player: Mission
Sirik: The shamans still have something to do for you. You should go to Nibelor and talk to them if you haven't been there for a while.
Player: Nibelor
Sirik: It's a sacred place for us! Our shamans live there. Ask Iskan if you want to go there.
Player: Iskan
Sirik: He is the leader of the dog sled. Last time I saw him he was with his dogs on the shelf ice north of the harbour.
Player: Shelf
Sirik: West of Svargrond is the Fimbul Ice Shelf, Nibelor and Grimlund are embedded in shelf ice, and in the north of Hrodmir are several small shelf ice fields.
Player: Fimbul
Sirik: Fimbul Shelf is the name of the big shelf ice west of Svargrond. A good spot to go ice fishing.
Player: Grimlund
Sirik: Stay away from there! It's the home of the chakoyas.
Player: Hrodmir
Sirik: This big, icy rock you're standing at right now. The raiders live in the middle and south of the big Formorgar glacier.
Player: Sled
Sirik: You can ask Iskan to bring you with his Dog Sled to Nibelor.
Player: Magic Ou fruids
Sirik: I heard Nelly talking about runes and fluids. Ask her.
Player: Nelly
Sirik: She is the post office clerk. Follow the moaning and you will find her.
Player: Spells

Sirik: You have to look for Romir.
Player: Romir
Sirik: He is an old hermit who lives in a hut on the elevated plain north of Svargrond . He is some kind of male witch, you know what I mean? ...
Sirik: He knows magic and all that. Maybe he teaches his knowledge to others.
Player: Nor

Player: Hjaern

Sirik: and Romir the old hermit who lives in a cave north of Svargrond may have some knowledge concerning magic.
Player: City
Sirik: Svargrond is the only city here. Do you want to know where to find a shop, a trainer for a profession or a guildhall?

Sirik: Crystal Glance is north of the depot at the street which leads to the arena and Mammoth Belly is to the south, near the furrier quarter.
Player: Arena
Sirik: If you think you are strong enough, then try to fight there. You have to challenge waves of monsters that get stronger and stronger. ...
Sirik: The entrance to the arena is a stairway north of the town, left of the town gate.
Player: Ferumbras
Sirik: Wait, wait! Don't say a word, it's, it's ...
