Player: Hi
Kjesse: May the spirits be with you, Player!
Player: Svargrond
Kjesse: There is nothing wrong with seeking the shelter of a city but we have to be careful not to lose our connection with the spirits.
Player: Thais / Carlin / venore
Kjesse: Speak to the outsiders who live here to learn about them and their cities.
Player: Edron
Kjesse: That is just another far away place of no concern to us.
Player: Chakoya
Kjesse: Only the harsh nature of the land keeps the chakoyas at the bay. If they would grow in numbers, they would surely annihilate all life here.
Player: Dwarf
Kjesse: Knowing the chakoya, we know better than to underestimate the small ones.
Player: Elf
Kjesse: At least those creatures seem more in touch with nature then other outsiders.
Player: Mine
Kjesse: The mines are lost territory. It's the problem of the people from Carlin though.
Player: Yeti
Kjesse: The yeti does exist.
Player: Cult
Kjesse: This is not of our concern.
Player: Barbarian
Kjesse: In our old language it means as much as 'the true people'. I understand that the word has a slightly different meaning in other languages.
Player: Blessing
Kjesse: There are five different blessings available in five sacred places. These blessings are: the spiritual shielding, the spark of the phoenix, the embrace of Tibia, the fire of the suns and the wisdom of solitude.
Player: Wisdom
Kjesse: I can sense you already talked to the hermit Eremo on the isle of Cormaya and recieved this blessing.
Player: Years Of Serpents
Kjesse: It was not natural for the sea serpents to behave that way. As suddenly as this behaviour started, as suddenly it ended. Nature got its way in the end.
Player: Jarl
Kjesse: The jarl oversees all affairs of common interest. We shamans oversee the spiritual affairs.
Player: Raiders
Kjesse: They enjoy violence and destruction. They are so wrong on their misguided way. That's all Yakchal's fault. She poisoned their minds with false ideas. She's a disgrace for all shamans.
Player: Shaman Ou druid
Kjesse: Even though we call ourself shamans, our doctrines and our magic are quite similar to those of the druids.
Player: Chyll
Kjesse: That's the name of the spirit essence of the north wind.
Player: Nibelor
Kjesse: The isle of Nibelor has been the centre of our shamanistic forefathers in ancient times.
Player: Name
Kjesse: I am Kjesse.
Player: Job
Kjesse: I am a shaman.
Player: Mission Ou task
Kjesse: Your mission should be to become one with nature. That is maybe the only way to bear Chyll's icy breath.
Player: King
Kjesse: Our jarl is more of a spokesperson. We don't know any kings or queens here.
Player: Queen
Kjesse: Our jarl is more of a spokesperson. We don't know any kings or queens here.
Player: Gods
Kjesse: Our believes are different from those of the outsiders. Ask on Nibelor to learn more about our believes.
Player: Ferumbras
Kjesse: He must be driven by the darkest spirits.
Player: Excalibug
Kjesse: It's only an outsider's tale.
Player: News
Kjesse: I am not overly interested in the affairs of men.
Player: Offer
Kjesse: I have nothing to sell but I can tell you where to go if you want to get a blessing.
Player: How Are You?
Kjesse: I am fine.
Player: Rumours
Kjesse: It's rather a wisdom than a rumour I want to give you on your way. When you feel Chyll in your heart and you have no fear anymore, your way to Everspring will be flattened.
Player: Bye
Kjesse: May the spirits guide your way, Player.
