Player: Hi
Hawkyr: Hello fellow hunter. Are you looking for paladin spells? I'm your man.
Player: Name
Hawkyr: I am Hawkyr the hunter.
Player: Job
Hawkyr: I am a hunter and bowyer. If you need some training, I am the man you want to see.
Player: Mission / Task
Hawkyr: Sorry, I don't have anything to do for you.
Player: King
Hawkyr: In our lands, the most successful hunter is the king. Be it beast or man.
Player: Queen
Hawkyr: In our lands, the most successful huntress is the queen. Be it beast or woman.
Player: Gods
Hawkyr: The gods of the south seem to have little influence here.
Player: Spells
Hawkyr: Sorry, I don't teach spells for your vocation.
Player: Druid / Shaman
Hawkyr: They know the ways of spirits and nature. You can learn a lot from them just by listening. Still, you can always learn a lot if you're listening well to what nature tells you.
Player: Ferumbras
Hawkyr: Better ask the Southerners about that one.
Player: Excalibug
Hawkyr: A weapon hardly useful for a hunter.
Player: News
Hawkyr: The wolves are very hungry lately.
Player: Carlin
Hawkyr: I don't think I'd like that place and it's not only that this is not my marked territory.
Player: Edron / Port Hope
Hawkyr: Only foreigners talk about that place now and then.
Player: Svargrond
Hawkyr: I admire the safety of the burrow and the closeness of the pack. It's a good thing to have a lair to which you can withdraw to lick your wounds.
Player: Thais
Hawkyr: Thais is some far away city.
Player: Venore
Hawkyr: Carlin and Venore seem to live in some sort of rivalry.
Player: Dwarf
Hawkyr: Most dwarfs I've seen seem to lack the stealthiness to become a good hunter.
Player: Elf
Hawkyr: Elves are good hunters. Even I was able to learn something from the elves that came here. I am thinking about visiting their city some day.
Player: Chakoya
Hawkyr: The chakoya are ferocious hunters. They don't only kill out of hunger, they love the carnage they are causing.
Player: Yeti
Hawkyr: Yetis are rare but they do exist. Everyone that has been hunting in the frozen wastes for some time can share stories of their sightings.
Player: Dragon
Hawkyr: It's not easy to hunt dragons. Suddenly, a hunter might become the hunted in their lairs.
Player: Cult
Hawkyr: I don't know anything about it.
Player: Barbarian
Hawkyr: Being a barbarian means to be one with nature and its instincts.
Player: Raiders
Hawkyr: Their packs are not of our kin anymore. They left our pack. We will see how they prosper. They have nothing to expect from us except for cold steel in their hearts.
Player: Mines
Hawkyr: As far as I have understood it, they are of some importance for the people of Carlin.
Player: Chyll
Hawkyr: Father north wind knows best.
Player: Nibelor
Hawkyr: An isle on which the shamans live.
Player: Years Of Serpents
Hawkyr: I wonder if even bigger hunter have driven them away.
Player: How Are You?
Hawkyr: I only feel alive when I'm on a hunt. But even I need some time to rest and regain strength.
Player: Bye
Hawkyr: Good hunting, Player.
