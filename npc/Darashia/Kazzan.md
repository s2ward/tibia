Player: hi
Kazzan: Feel welcome in the lands of the children of the enlightened Daraman, Player.
Player: name
Kazzan: I am Kazzan Ibn Gadral, caliph of Darama.
Player: lands
Kazzan: I am the caliph of the children of Daraman. It is my privilege and mission to ensure their safety.
Player: caliph
Kazzan: A caliph is a leader of his people, just like a king.
Player: Daraman
Kazzan: Daraman led our ancestors to the continent Darashia to live a life of simplicity and meditation.
Player: mission
Kazzan: There is nothing you can do for me right now but thank you for offering your help.
Player: Drefia
Kazzan: When the djinns destroyed the better part of the unholy town in their wrath, the brotherhood hid like worms in the sand.
Player: Brotherhood of Bones
Kazzan: The Brotherhood of Bones came here fleeing some war on the continent. They corrupted the settlers of the Thaian colony with ease.
Player: king or Thais
Kazzan: Tibianus is the shepherd of the lost souls of the so called Thaian empire.
Player: gods
Kazzan: The gods are powerful but it's ultimately up to us to work on our souls' ascension.
Player: Excalibug
Kazzan: Once a djinn claimed to have seen it in a dream. I guess it's just that, some dream of a supernatural creature.
Kazzan: Feel welcome in the lands of the children of the enlightened Daraman, Player.
Player: Mission
Kazzan: Do you know the location of the djinn fortresses in the mountains south of here?
Player: Yes
Kazzan: Alright. The problem is that I want to know at least one of them on my side. You never know. I don't mind if it's the evil Efreet or the Marid. ...
Kazzan: Your mission will be to visit one kind of the djinns and bring them a peace-offering. Are you interested in that mission?
Player: Yes
Kazzan: Very good. I hope you are able to convince one of the fractions to stand on our side. If you haven't done yet, you should first go and look for old Melchior in Ankrahmun. ...
Kazzan: He knows many things about the djinn race and he may have some hints for you.
Player: Mission (if you said appeasement earlier)
Kazzan: Well, I don't blame you for that. I am sure you did your best. Now we can just hope that peace remains. Here, take this small gratification for your effort to help and Daraman may bless you!
Player: mission (if you said peace earlier)
Kazzan: These are great news. With the mighty Marid being loyal to us, our enemies won't dare to attack us again. Please take this gratification for your help and Daraman may bless you!
