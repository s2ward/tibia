Bolfona: I am not sure if I'd like to trade with you.  
Player: druid / sell  
Bolfona: I told you 1000 times, it's because of the mushrooms. They grow faster and so the flavour of the mushroom beer is better!

Player: trade  
Bolfona: Oh well, you don't seem to be THAT bad. What do you want?  
Player: bye  
Bolfona: Good news!  
Bolfona (Iddle): You consider yourself superior? Let me show you the drinking skills of a female dwarf.
Bolfona (Iddle): YES, I'm female. Got a problem with that?!?
Bolfona (Iddle): Come on guys, have a drink.
