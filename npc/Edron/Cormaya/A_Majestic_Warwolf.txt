Player: hi / hello
A Majestic Warwolf: Interesting. A human who can speak the language of wolves.  
A Majestic Warwolf: I can see in your eyes that you are a honest and friendly person, Player. You were patient enough to learn our language and I will grant you a special gift. Will you accept it?  
A Majestic Warwolf: From now on, you shall be known as Player, the bear warrior. You shall be strong and proud as Angros, the great dark bear. He shall guide your path.  
A Majestic Warwolf: YOOOOUHHOOOUU!
