Player: hi  
Owin: Greetings!  
Player: name  
Owin: My name is Owin.  
Player: job  
Owin: I'm actually a hunter. Or used to be, at any rate. But lately I made some efforts to find out more about the so called Curse of the Full Moon. So I'm also a kind of researcher by now.  
Player: Curse  
Owin: Humans transform into wild beasts: wolves, boars, bears and others. If you want to know more, feel free to read the parchment here on my cot. I wrote down all my insights.  
Player: Moon  
Owin: At full moon humans transform into wild beasts: wolves, boars, bears and others. Some call it the Curse of the Full Moon, others think it is a kind of sickness.  
Player: bye  
Owin: Farewell.
