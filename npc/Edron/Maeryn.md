Player: hi  
Maeryn: Greetings! We are still fighting the Curse of the Full Moon. 
Player: name  
Maeryn: My name is Maeryn. 
Player: job  
Maeryn: I'm the protector of this little village. A bit of a self-proclaimed function, I admit, but someone has to watch over Grimvale. It is a dangerous place. 
Player: Grimvale  
Maeryn: The small island you are standing on. For a long time it was a peaceful and placid place. But lately it has become more dangerous. 
Player: dangerous  
Maeryn: So you don't know it yet. This island, Grimvale, is affected by were-sickness. Many pitiful, who are stricken with the curse, dwell in the tunnels and caverns underneath the village and the nearby hurst. 
Player: pitiful  
Maeryn: Yes, pitiful. For they are savage beasts now who regularly come up from below to attack the village. But once they were inhabitants of Grimvale, before they changed. 
Player: changed  
Maeryn: Through a bite or even a scratch, you may be infected with the were-sickness. If that happens, there is little hope - until the next full moon you'll change into a were-creature, depending on the animal that hurt you. 
Player: hope  
Maeryn: There is a plant, the purple nightshade. It blossoms exclusively in the light of the full moon and only underground, where the full moon's light is falling through fissures 
Player: were-sickness  / curse 
Maeryn: It transforms peaceful villagers into savage beasts. We're not sure how this curse found the way into our small village. But one day it began. At first it befell just a few people. ... 
Maeryn: In a full moon night they changed into bears and wolves, and tore apart their unsuspecting relatives while they were asleep. ... 
Maeryn: Those merely wounded, first thought they were lucky. But then we realised they were changing, too. Later, others assumed the forms of badgers and boars also. ... 
Maeryn: But that does not mean they were any less wild or dangerous than the others. 
Player: tunnels  
Maeryn: We are not sure what they are doing down there. We're glad if they stay in the caverns and leave us alone. Only at full moon do they come up and threaten the island's surface and village. ... 
Maeryn: I, however, have a hunch as to why they dwell so deep under the earth. 
Player: hunch  
Maeryn: There are old legends about a subterranean temple that was once built in this area. Supposedly many artefacts are still hidden down there. ... 
Maeryn: I don't have the time to tell you the entire tale, but there is a book downstairs in which you may read the whole story. 
Player: artefacts  
Maeryn: Yes, the story goes that there are ancient artefacts still hidden in the temple ruins, such as helmets in the form of wolven heads, for example. It is said that moonlight crystals are needed to enchant these artefacts. 
Player: moonlight crystals 
Maeryn: The moonlight crystals are extremely rare. Supposedly they resemble berg crystal but have a more silvery gleam. My grandmother once told me that they may be used to enchant amulets or other things. But I don't know, whether this is true or just a fable. 
Player: moon 
Maeryn: Every month around the 13th, the single Tibian moon will by fully visible to us. That's when the curse hits us hardest. 
Maeryn: The two days around the 13th, the 12th and the 14th, are considered 'Harvest Moon', those are the best to gather nightshade. However, only after it has reached its apex on the 13th, the curse strengthens. 
Maeryn: We do not know what happens down there in those tunnels around that time but there is a presence there, we all feel - yet cannot quite fathom. ... 
Maeryn: At full moon, humans transform into wild beasts: wolves, boars, bears and others. Some call it the Curse of the Full Moon, others think it is a kind of sickness. ... 
Maeryn: During this time, we try to not leave the house, we shut the windows and hope it will pass. The curse will weaken a bit after that but it returns. 
Player: nightshade 
Maeryn: Three of these blossoms should suffice to heal some afflicted persons. But if you bring more I'd be grateful, of course. 
Player: Cornell 
Maeryn: He's basically a ferryman nowadays, but I remember when he was our village's leading fisherman. He offers a ferry service between Grimvale and Edron. You must have met him - he sailed you here. 
Player: bye  
Maeryn: Farewell, then.
