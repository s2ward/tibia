Player: fae
A Swan: Some call us nature spirits or peri but we prefer the term fae. Most of us are rather reclusive and live peaceful lives in our secret realm. We only leave it in order to protect our home. ...
A Swan: As we tend to be secretive about our true nature I'm afraid I can't tell you more.

A Swan: Dark energies are seeping into the world. They are tainting our home as much as everything else. We couldn't discover the origin of these energies on Feyrist itself, Therefore, some of us decided to leave our home and investigate.
