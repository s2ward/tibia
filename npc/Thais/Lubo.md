Lubo: It is said that once there lived a great magician on the top of this mountain.
Player: Magician
Lubo: I don't remember his name, but it's said that his banner was the black eye.
Player: Crunor's Cottage
Lubo: Ah yes, I remember my grandfather talking about that name. This house used to be an inn a long time ago. My family bought it from some of these flower guys.
Player: Flower guys
Lubo: Oh, I mean druids of course. They sold the cottage to my family after some of them died in an accident or something like that.Player: Accident
Lubo: As far as I can remember the story, a pet escaped its stable behind the inn. It got somehow involved with powerful magic at a ritual and was transformed in some way.
Player: Stable
Lubo: My grandpa told me, in the old days there were some behind this cottage. Nothing big though, just small ones, for chicken or rabbits.
