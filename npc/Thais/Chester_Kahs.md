Player: Hi
Chester Kahs: Salutations, stranger.
Player: Job
Chester Kahs: I am the head of the TBI.
Player: TBI
Chester Kahs: The Tibian Bureau of Investigation, the secret service of His Royal Highness.
Player: Investigation
Chester Kahs: We collect information about people and incidents.
Player: Incidents
Chester Kahs: There are things that must be kept secret.
Player: People
Chester Kahs: We know much about the citizens and some other people.
Player: Citizens
Chester Kahs: I only can give you some official information about our citizens. About whom do you wish to talk?
Player: Secret
Chester Kahs: Certain information is not for the eyes and ears of everyone. Please understand that.
Player: King
Chester Kahs: King Tibianus III is our leader and my direct superior.
Player: Superior
Chester Kahs: I report directly to the king himself.
Player: Report
Chester Kahs: My reports are confidential and for the ears and eyes of the king only.
Player: Castle
Chester Kahs: The castle isn't safe! I warned them of the entrance to the dungeons, but no one is litstening. How many people have to die before they do something about that?
Player: Dungeon
Chester Kahs: Monsters lurk in each corner of the dungeons, which spread beneath us, breeding in the shadows and plotting to destroy us all.
Player: City
Chester Kahs: The city is open to almost everyone. That literally opens doors for all kinds of criminals and fiends.
Player: Criminals
Chester Kahs: There are so many murderers and thiefs out there that I wonder if there is some greater force of evil subtly encouraging that.
Player: Enemies
Chester Kahs: The people of the northern city, the minotaurs, the followers of Zathroth, the demons, and countless others!
Player: News
Chester Kahs: Sorry, almost news that are a little interesting are confidential.
Player: Dangers
Chester Kahs: Danger is common like day and night for a Tibian, who keeps his eyes open.
Player: Druids
Chester Kahs: It is said that druids are preservers of life and good aligned, but let me ask you if it's so 'good' to sell runes to the highest bidder, no matter who that might be? I hink you get the point!
Player: Knights
Chester Kahs: It's too easy to become a knight. They take almost everyone. And if you look in the streets you can see what happens if you give training and a flashy title to almost veryone.
Player: Paladins
Chester Kahs: They should be noble warriors, but does it take bravery to shoot someone from a certain distance? The former paladins were virtuous heroes, the ones you meet today are just simple treasure hunters.
Player: Sorcerer]]s
Chester Kahs: I don't know where they got their secret spells in the first place, nor did most of them know ... If I were a sorcerer that would be a fact to give me nightmares.
Player: Demons
Chester Kahs: They say there are just two of them in the underground ruins! These damned fools! There are dozens of them! And the two they already saw are only some of the eakest of demonkind!
Player: Underground Ruins
Chester Kahs: We have no clue what happened to the civilization that once dwelled underground, but their complete extinction should be a warning to us!
Player: Benjamin
Chester Kahs: Something happened to him that snapped his mind. Can we be sure what more might have happened to him unnoticed?
Player: Bozo
Chester Kahs: He isn't the fool he pretends to be. So to what is he up to?
Player: Frodo
Chester Kahs: Have you noticed how easy it would be to poison his supplies and kill a great deal of people with ease?
Player: Gorn
Chester Kahs: A man too concerned about profit to be trustworthy. This kind of man sells his soul to the highest bidder. It's just a question if he has done it already or will do it soon.
Player: Lynda
Chester Kahs: She puts her trust in the help of beings she can't comprehend. Think by yourself if that's clever.
Player: McRonald
Chester Kahs: Have you ever wondered what these caves under their farm are good for? And have you noticed how many adventurers go down there and never return? Well, think about it!
Player: Partos
Chester Kahs: This criminal was wanted for many crimes. At last he got caught and put to jail.
Player: Quentin
Chester Kahs: A peaceful man. But in our days peace is just an illusion. We are surrounded by enemies and dangers.
Player: Sam
Chester Kahs: I say it's a mistake to rely on a single person for such vital services.
Player: Ferumbras
Chester Kahs: Some say he's the avatar of Zathroth himself, but perhaps the truth about him is even darker then the worst rumours can imagine.
Player: Harsky
Chester Kahs: He is one of the few people I can trust.
Player: Stutch
Chester Kahs: He is one of the few people I can trust.
Player: Guards
Chester Kahs: I think we can't trust the guards anymore.
Player: Ruthless seven
Chester Kahs: We know little about them. But even that gives me nightmares! But it's your lucky day, since this information is confidential, and so it can't bother you.
Player: Bye
Chester Kahs: Take care out there!
