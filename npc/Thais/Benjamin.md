Player: Hi
Benjamin: Hello. How may I help you Player? Ask me for a trade if you want to buy something. I can also explain the mail system.
Player: Trade
Benjamin: Don't forget that you need to buy a label too if you want to send a parcel. Always write the name of the receiver in the first line and make sure you entered it correctly.
Player: Receiver
Benjamin: Well, the receiver - or addressee - is the person you want to send mail to. Always make sure to enter his or her name correctly.
Player: Mail
Benjamin: With our mail system you can send letters and parcels to other Tibians. I can either explain how letters and parcels work or sell them to you if you ask me for a trade.
Player: Letters
Benjamin: If you want to buy a letter, ask me for a trade. Or do you want me to explain how letters work?
Player: Explain
Benjamin: With a letter you can send a message to another Tibian's depot. If you want to send it to 'Ben' in Thais, use the letter - so that a form opens - and write 'Ben' in the first line. Write your message below that. ...
Benjamin: Then drag your letter on one of the blue mailboxes here to send it.
Player: Depot
Benjamin: Each major city has at least one depot. Just step in front of one of the lockers and you can store items inside. Your mail will also arrive there. It doesn't matter which depot you stored it in - you can retrieve all your items from any depot in any city!
Player: Mailboxes
Benjamin: With our mail system you can send letters and parcels to other Tibians. I can either explain how letters and parcels work or sell them to you if you ask me for a trade.
