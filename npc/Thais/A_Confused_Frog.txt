NPC: A Confused Frog  
Note: Conversation only possible during the mission (The Scatterbrained Sorcerer Quest).  
Player: Assistant  
A Confused Frog: I don't want to be an assistant anymore. Ribbit. I just want my dream pond.  
Player: Kiss  
A Confused Frog: Errr... I'd rather not. Don't take it personally.  
Player: Magic  
A Confused Frog: Magic, pah. Ribbit. I don't need magic. I just want some flies, actually. Ribbit.  
Player: Job  
A Confused Frog: I used to be Eclesius' assistant! Argh! Then - ribbit - one of his crazy experimental spells backfired and hit me. That's when I lost my job I guess. Ribbit.  
Player: Name  
Confused Frog: Well... ribbit... my name is Turian. But that doesn't really matter anymore.  
Player: Demon  
A Confused Frog: That demon is called ribbit. Erm, no, I mean Samael. He is one REALLY annoyed demon overlord, but we get along okay. Not sure if I'd let him out of there though. Ribbit.  
Player: Samael  
A Confused Frog: Yep, he told me one day that that was his name. In the tone of voice that makes your ears almost explode and singes your hair.  
Player: Frog  
A Confused Frog: You know... being a frog isn't that bad. Ribbit. I don't want to be a human again. I just wish I could get out of this cage and live by a lovely little pond.  
Player: Ribbit  
A Confused Frog: Yeah, you said it. Ribbit. Told you, being a frog isn't that bad, see.  
Player: Eclesius  
A Confused Frog: That old fool! He should be locked up with his weird theories and ideas and forced to study some serious magic! Rrrribbit!  
Player: Pond  
A Confused Frog: I like the pond north of Thais. It's a really cosy place. Not just for humans, but especially for frogs. Ribbit.  
Player: Bye  
A Confused Frog: Take care. Ribbit.
