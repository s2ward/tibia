Player: Hi
Albinius: Greetings, pilgrim. Welcome to the halls of hope. We are the keepers of this temple and welcome everyone willing to contribute.
Player: Job
Albinius: I find ways to unveil the secrets of the stars. Judging by this question, I doubt you follow my weekly publications concerning this research.
Player: Astral Shapers
Albinius: The Shapers were an advanced civilisation, well versed in art, construction, language and exploration of our world in their time. ...
Albinius: The foundations of this temple are testament to their genius and advanced understanding of complex problems. They were master craftsmen and excelled in magic.
Player: Temple
Albinius: You already offered enough tomes for us to study and rebuild this temple. Thank you, my child.
Player: Tome
Albinius: The Shapers have been eager to share and document their wisdom in any way possible. They knew many ways of preserving information, some of them probably not yet known to or even understandable by us ...
Albinius: Right now the most helpful records of the Shapers are the various tomes they wrote. You may still find some of them in the vicinity of Thais, some locked away in old chests, others robbed by feral creatures. ...
Albinius: They surely use them for terrible profane purposes so getting them back would be a service to the Shapers. Furthermore these tomes might contain everything we need to finish the temple.
Player: Bye
Albinius: Farewell, my child.
