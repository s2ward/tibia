Player: hi
Albert: Welcome in my humble hut, Player. If you are heavily wounded or poisoned, I can heal you.
Player: job
Albert: I'm a healer.
Player: name
Albert: My Name is Albert Fibulanian.
Player: heal
Albert: You aren't looking really bad. Sorry, I can't help you.
Player: tibia
Albert: Tibia is a world big enough for everyone. I wish people would realize that.
Player: thais / edron / humble hut
Albert: The sinful city of Thais is a monument of corruption and murder. I am glad I left for Edron and thank the gods every day for this isle.
Player: god
Albert: The gods of good take care of us.
Player: king / tibianus
Albert: The king does much to enhance the life of his people, but he could do more.
Player: army / banor
Albert: I dream of times which see no need for armies or warriors.
Player: ferumbras
Albert: The fallen one is a perfect example where evil leads us to.
Player: excalibug
Albert: It's only another instrument of pain and destruction.
Player: news
Albert: I have only news about weather, taxes, and harvests. I heared nothing that might interest a traveller like you.
Player: daniel
Albert: I healed his wounds, but nothing can heal his soul after the betrayal of some of his knightly brethren.
Player: betrayal
Albert: Oh better ask the knights about that issue. I know only little about that tragic story. Some knights betrayed their order and joined some sinister cult in the northern ruins.
Player: kaine
Albert: Another victim of his own ambitions. I mourn for his soul.
Player: fibula
Albert: My family used to live on the isle of Fibula. At this time it wasn't overrun by soldiers of fortune. Later, I was sent to Thais to learn the art of healing, while my family was amongst the first settlers of Edron.
Player: time
Albert: Now, it is horas.
Player: bye
Albert: Good bye, Player!
