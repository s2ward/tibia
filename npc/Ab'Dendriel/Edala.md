Player: Hi. (primeiro dia)
Edala: Ashari, Player. How... nice to see a human taking interest in a beautiful art such as music.
Player: Hi. (segundo dia)
Edala: Ashari, Player... that sound was.. interesting.
Player: Hi. (terceiro dia)
Edala: Ashari, Player. You've made some... progress playing the lyre, haven't you..? I want to believe you have.
Player: Hi. (quarto dia)
Edala: Player. My regular visitor. I certainly... appreciate your efforts to entertain me, but let me assure you, I'm quite comfortable up here by myself. Alone. In silence.
Player: Hi. (quinto dia)
Edala: Ashari, Player. I'm starting to feel a little sorry... for your lyre. Being forced to produce such noise must be a tragic fate.
Player: Hi. (sexto dia)
Edala: Player! You're driving me insane! I beg you, take your lyre away from this sacred and peaceful place.
Edala: AAAARGH! Player! My ears! I'd prefer listening to drunken dwarves rambling all day to the sound of your lyre! Please, at least get it tuned. Here, you can have this elvish diapason.
Player: diapason.
Edala: This item has magical abilities. We elves use it to tune our instruments so they create the most silvery, delicate song. It might have other uses, but I wouldn't know about that.
