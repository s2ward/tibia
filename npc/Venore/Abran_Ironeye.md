Player: Hi
Abran Ironeye: Hail, Player!
Player: Job
Abran Ironeye: I am a busy man. I run the Ironhouse.
Player: Ironhouse
Abran Ironeye: What do you think? Here weapons and armor are forged, repaired, and sold.
Player: Excalibug
Abran Ironeye: If someone would bring me that weapon I could reshape the realm... and reward this hero beyond his dreams.
Player: Teddy
Abran Ironeye: I don't know anything about a teddy... and if you are smart you shouldn't either...
Player: Tibia
Abran Ironeye: The world is ready for a significant change.
Player: Banor
Abran Ironeye: As a man that grows up needs no mommy, a warrior has to outgrow his need for gods.
Player: King
Abran Ironeye: I would like to see a true warrior-king in Thais... like in the old days. But who knows, perhaps one day the tides of fate will bring such a man to power. Who knows...
Player: Thais
Abran Ironeye: Thais has outlived its usefulness since years. Its star is sinking.
Player: Carlin
Abran Ironeye: Their independence is a proof for the weakness of Thais.
Player: Excalibug
Abran Ironeye: If someone would bring me that weapon I could reshape the realm... and reward this hero beyond his imagination.
Player: Ferumbras
Abran Ironeye: Quite a challenge, but his bets for power were made without the finesse of a true warrior.
Player: Bye
Abran Ironeye: You are dismissed.
