Player: Hi
Asrak: I welcome you, Player!
Player: Job
Asrak: I am the overseer of the pits and the trainer of the gladiators.
Player: Gladiators
Asrak: Those wannabe fighters are weak and most of them are unable to comprehend a higher concept like the Mooh'Tah.
Player: Help
Asrak: I teach worthy warriors the way of the knight.
Player: Name
Asrak: I am known as Asrak the Ironhoof.
Player: Time
Asrak: It is 0:00 pm.
Player: King / tibianus
Asrak: I pledge no allegiance to any king, be it human or minotaurean.
Player: Army
Asrak: Your human army might be big, but without skills. They are only sheep to be slaughtered.
Player: Spell
Asrak: Sorry, I only teach spells to knights and paladins.
Player: Dungeon
Asrak: The dungeons of your desires and fears are the only ones you really should fear and those you really have to conquer.
Player: Gods
Asrak: By them we were imbued with the rage that almost costed our existence. By them we were used as pawns in wars that were not ours.
Player: Monsters
Asrak: Inferior creatures of rage, driven by their primitive urges. Only worthy to be noticed to test one's skills.
Player: Ferumbras
Asrak: To rely on magic is like to cheat fate. All cheaters will find their just punishment one day, and so will he.
Player: Excalibug
Asrak: If it's truly a weapon to slay gods it might be worth to be sought for.
Player: Venore
Asrak: The city pays me well and those undisciplined gladiators need my skills and guidance badly.
Player: Mintwallin
Asrak: The city is only a shadow of what we could have accomplished without that curse of rage that the gods bestowed upon us.
Player: Minotaur
Asrak: In the ancient wars we lost much because of the rage. The one good thing is we lost our trust in the gods, too.
Player: Rage
Asrak: Rage is the legacy of Brog, the beast. To overcome it is our primal goal. The Mooh'Tah is our only hope of salvation and perfection.
Player: Mooh'tah
Asrak: The Mooh'Tah teaches us control. It provides you with weapon, armor, and shield. It teaches you harmony and focus.
Player: Harmony
Asrak: There is an elegant harmony in every thing done right. If you feel the harmony of an action you can sing its song.
Player: Song
Asrak: Each harmonic action has it own song. If you can sing it, you are in harmony with that action. This is where the minotaurean battlesongs come from.
Player: Battlesongs
Asrak: Each Mooh'Tah master focuses his skills on the harmony of battle. He is one with the song that he's singing with his voice or at least his heart.
Player: Weapon
Asrak: Make your will your weapon, and your enemies will perish.
Player: Armor
Asrak: Courage is the only armor that shields you against rage and fear, the greatest dangers you will have to face.
Player: Shield
Asrak: Your confidence shall be your shield. Nothing can penetrate that defence. No emotion will let you lose your focus.
Player: Bye
Asrak: May your path be as straight as an arrow.
Player: Hi
Asrak: I welcome you, Player!
Asrak: May your path be as straight as an arrow.
