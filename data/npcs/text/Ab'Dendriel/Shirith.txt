Shirith: Ashari Player. What can I do for you?  
Player: do for you / job  
Shirith: I am the overseer of the mines.  
Player: mines  
Shirith: We hardly get the ore we need. The worthless trolls are lazy workers. I keep them locked up the whole time.  
Player: trolls  
Shirith: We give these useless creatures a reason to live by serving us.  
Player: locked  
Shirith: I keep the keys to the mines.  
Player: keys  
Shirith: I would sell you a key for 50 gold, ok?  
Player: yes  
Shirith: Here it is.  
Player: name  
Shirith: I am called Shirith Blooddancer.  
Player: venore  
Shirith: If it comes to trade, I can respect those merchants. As long as they leave as soon as they have finished business, that is.  
Player: carlin  
Shirith: I think those humans are trespassing on elven territory far too often.  
Player: thais  
Shirith: Thais is far away, as all humans should be.  
Player: time  
Shirith: It is 8:18 pm.

Player: elves  
Shirith: We are a superior race, indeed.  
Player: dwarfs

Player: humans  
Shirith: Humans are more annoying than our trolls.  
Player: cenath  
Shirith: They think they are better than us.  
Player: kuridai  
Shirith: We keep this society running. Without our tools and work our case would be a lost one.  
Player: deraisim  
Shirith: They could do more for us if they would try more hard.  
Player: abdaisim  
Shirith: Let them go, we don't need them.  
Player: teshial  
Shirith: Who needs dreamers these days?  
Player: ferumbras

Player: excalibug  
Shirith: Nonsense.  
Player: news  
Shirith: I would sell you a key for 50 gold, ok?
