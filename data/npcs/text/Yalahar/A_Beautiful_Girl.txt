Player: Hi  
A Beautiful Girl: So you have come, Player. I hoped you would not...  
Player: Job  
A Beautiful Girl: I don't have a profane 'job' - it is my destiny to devour evil and bring a new dawn.  
Player: Help, Misson / Quest  
A Beautiful Girl: You sound like you wish to help me. Yet I must walk this path alone - but thank you.  
Player: World/tibia  
A Beautiful Girl: I see how corrupt this world has become and it makes me want to cry.  
Player: Name  
A Beautiful Girl: My name would be unspeakable for your tongue. You may call me Devovorga - which comes rather close.  
Player: Corrupt  
A Beautiful Girl: What you call 'corruption' could be salvation - and what you consider 'good' is rotten to its pitch black close.  
Player: Human  
A Beautiful Girl: You're welcome to join me in the pain you also helped causing.  
Player: Creators  
A Beautiful Girl: Yes, I was created. And I'm not a mere being like humans, devils, demons or even gods. I'm a weapon. I'm devouring. I'm hungry. I want revenge.  
Player: Devovorga  
A Beautiful Girl: How cute and shallow that sounds from your limited vocal chords and lips. You should have heard my enslavers pronounce it - accompanied by thunder in their voices that shook earth and sky.  
Player: Trapped  
A Beautiful Girl: I'm trapped in this useless body. But I can feel it begin to change... finally...  
Player: Vengoth  
A Beautiful Girl: I've been waiting here for a long time. Even before this continent started turning dark.
