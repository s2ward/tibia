 Player: hi  
Julius: Be greeted, adventurer Player. Please excuse me if I appear distracted!  
Player: distracted / job  
Julius: I come from a family of vampire hunters, but to be honest, I'm more into the theoretic part and strategic planning.  
Player: vampire  
Julius: Our nightly blood-sucking visitors put the inhabitants of Yalahar in constant danger.  
Player: yalahar  
Julius: A better name would be Gomorrah, if you ask me.  
Player: name  
Julius: My name is Julius.  
Player: storkus  
Julius: Storkus? Oh yes, I know him. A long time ago we used to hunt together... sometimes.  
Player: diary  
Julius: Have you brought a missing page from Marziel's diary?  
Player: no  
Julius: Well I hope you'll find lots!  
Player: diary  
Julius: Have you brought a missing page from Marziel's diary?  
Player: yes  
Julius: I fear you don't carry any new parts of the story with you. Or, if you do, you haven't found them yourself.  
Player: time  
Julius: It's about time you showed the vampires that they should never bother the citizens again.  
Player: trade  
Julius: I'll reward you for every pair of vampire teeth you bring me.  
Player: news  
Julius: Another vampire raid last night. But then again, that's nothing new.  
Player: thank  
Julius: Well, I should be the one to thank you I guess.  
Player: farewell / bye  
Julius: Good bye, Player. Never trust anyone.
