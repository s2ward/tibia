Player: hi  
Serafin: Welcome to my fruit and vegetable store, Player! Ask me for a trade if you'd like to see my wares.  
Player: name  
Serafin: I'm Serafin, pleased to meet you.  
Player: julius  
Serafin: I think that poor guy has serious trust issues... must be hard if you are obsessed with the idea that everyone is your enemy or a monster.  
Player: armenius  
Serafin: I think he runs a bar in the former trade quarter.  
Player: lisander  
Serafin: Oh yes, I see him often. Nice guy.  
Player: maris  
Serafin: A man of the seas.  
Player: ortheus  
Serafin: I like him, but unfortunately I don't have much time to chat with him anymore.  
Player: trade  
Serafin: Oh, sure, take a look!  
Player: vampire  
Serafin: I don't know what you're talking about.  
Player: blood  
Serafin: This is a fruit store. No slaughterhouse.  
Player: cookies  
Serafin: It'd be better for you to leave now.  
Player: yalahar  
Serafin: Oh, this lovely city is a great place to live and to do business.  
Player: quarter  
Serafin: Well, actually this is not a quarter but the city centre.  
Player: garlic  
Serafin: I'm so sorry, but I don't sell garlic.  
Player: alori mort  
Serafin: There's something about these words which makes me feel awkward. Or maybe it's you who causes that feeling. You better get lost.  
Player: job  
Serafin: Oh, I'm selling fruits and veggies as you can see. If you want to have a closer look, ask me for a trade.  
Player: mission / quest  
Serafin: Sorry, but I already have a delivery boy.  
Player: bye  
Serafin: Good bye, my dear customer.
