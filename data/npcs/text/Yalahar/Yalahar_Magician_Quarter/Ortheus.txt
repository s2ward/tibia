Player: job  
Ortheus: Hm, good question. Maybe old, wise man?  
Player: name  
Ortheus: I'm used to being called old man. Simple as that.

Ortheus: Have you actually brought me a mug of tea??  
Player: no  
Ortheus: What a pity.  
Player: reward  
Ortheus: I don't have anything that I could give you as a reward. Guess you aren't so selfless after all, huh?
