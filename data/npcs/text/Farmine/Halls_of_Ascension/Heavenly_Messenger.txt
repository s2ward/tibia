Player: hi
Heavenly Messenger: Greetings, mortal heroes! I am a messenger of the heavenly forces.
Player: messenger
Heavenly Messenger: I am the bearer of dire news indeed.
Player: dire
Heavenly Messenger: The place that does not exist, the realm beyond which is not, has threatened creation since the dawn of time. ...
Heavenly Messenger: The foolishly proud Yalahari brought upon us the first incursion but the madness fed on itself and could be contained. But now, the inevitable has happened, and the walls have fallen. ...
Heavenly Messenger: That which is not, has become that which never should be. Destruction is leaking into our world and we will all feel its dreadful hand in the future. ...
Heavenly Messenger: Though Ferumbras could be stopped, his madness allowed the not-existent to get hold of our world once and for all. ...
Heavenly Messenger: The rift cannot be closed and will only widen with time. The forces from beyond will spread and grow. Each of us will encounter and fight them soon enough. ...
Heavenly Messenger: They will work to further the incursion, to undo more of the world and spread their power. ...
Heavenly Messenger: They will prepare for the full arrival of their master and one day he will come for all of us, for we are what he hates, we all are alive, existence and possibilities and he is the negation of all of that. ...
Heavenly Messenger: We must prepare and gain as much time as we can. We need to gather all strength, forces and knowledge to be prepared for that what is to come. ...
Heavenly Messenger: Go and spread the word, for the time has come to forge alliances and claim old debts. Gather your friends and prepare yourself. The worst is yet to come.
Player: rift
Heavenly Messenger: It seems that in fighting so close to the rift to beyond, you acquired a new outfit! What a strange occurrence indeed.
