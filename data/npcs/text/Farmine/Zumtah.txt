Player: hi  
Zumtah: Another visitor to this constricted, cosy, calm realm, perfect except for an exit. Muhaha.  
Player: exit  
Zumtah: It's you, why did they throw you in here again? Anyway, I will just transform you once more. I also recovered your crate which will wait for you at the exit. There, feel free to go.  
Player: job  
Zumtah: I wait. I wait for someone like you to come here. I wait for them to grow disconsolate. I wait for them to despair. And I wait for them to die. Muhahaha.  
Player: name / djinn / zumtah  
Zumtah: I am Zumtah, Zumtah the impeccable, Zumtah the marvellous, Zumtah the... the... eternal.  
Player: zao  
Zumtah: The land you are currently dwelling in, human. Don't you have any sense of your surroundings?  
Player: humans  
Zumtah: I have seen many of them. I have seen many of them die. In here, with me. Perhaps you will be pleased to meet them. Not long and you will join their ranks. Muhaha.  
Player: lizard  
Zumtah: Pesky creatures. Many of them have been brought here, many of them died here. Humans, lizards, beasts, they all die the same. Down here, with me. Muhahaha.  
Player: zalamon  
Zumtah: What? What do you mean by that?  
Player: emperor  
Zumtah: Hmm, an old one. I don't care much about politics or power, as here, he has none. Here, only I have power. Muhaha.  
Player: resistance  
Zumtah: What are you talking about, such things do not matter down here. Down here alone, isolated and broken. Muhaha.  
Player: bye  
Zumtah: Muhahaha.
