Player: Fire Dragon Dojo / Fire / Dragon / Dojo  
Nina: We of the Grey Shadow clan are studying the ways of the Chosen. Our training is hard, encounters with the lizards often deadly. Every one of us fights on his own. Each one more deadly than the other. Under my lead we will rise renewed, as the Shadow Nina.
