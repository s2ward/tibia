Player: hi  
Melian: Greetings, traveller Player. Where do you want me to fly you?  
Player: lizard  
Melian: There are many of them to the north and south of this continent. I had thought they only existed on Tiquanda, but I was mistaken.  
Player: zao  
Melian: What a strange and bizarre continent. I'm glad my landing place is far away from all the mess I've seen from above.  
Player: fly / service / job  
Melian: I'm a carpet pilot. I can fly you to the Femor Hills, to Kazordoon, Svargrond, Edron, Darashia or Issavi.  
Player: name  
Melian: Melian at your service.  
Player: mountain  
Melian: These mountains don't look friendly. I prefer not staying long inbetween my carpet trips.  
Player: carpet  
Melian: Only licensed carpet pilots are allowed to fly those.  
Player: orc  
Melian: There's so much green stuff down there that I'm not sure whether there are any, but yes, might be, might be.  
Player: dwarf / steamboat  
Melian: Well, dwarves and their steamboat technology are well and good, but nothing beats flying on a carpet.  
Player: farmine  
Melian: That's the name of that dwarven base as far as I know. Got a bit of a pessimistic ring to it if you ask me. Sounds to me like they're starving.  
Player: passage / tibia / ride / trip / transport  
Melian: I can fly you to Darashia on Darama, to Kazordoon, to Svargrond on Hrodmir, to Edron, to the Femor Hills or to Issavi if you like. Where do you want to go?  
Player: human  
Melian: The only humans I've seen on this continent are those that come up to my carpet.  
Player: continent  
Melian: What a strange and bizarre continent. I'm glad my landing place is far away from all the mess I've seen from above.  
Player: femur  
Melian: You are probably talking about the FEMOR hills.  
Player: time  
Melian: It's 2:55 pm right now. I think I'm five minutes late in my schedule.  
Player: bye  
Melian: Good bye!
