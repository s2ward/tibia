Player: hi
Barazbaz: Oh, hello there!
Player: name
Barazbaz: I'm known as Barazbaz.
Player: job
Barazbaz: I'm the historian of Rathleton and I'm also responsible for the city archives. A most important job, as you might have guessed.
Player: glooth
Barazbaz: You just need it for everything.
Player: rathleton
Barazbaz: I heard that in other cities a single person decides everything. That must be a very rich and busy person, to get all those votes for his own. ...
Barazbaz: To live there must be wonderful, as that single person does so much there is nothing left to do for the others.
Player: minotaurs
Barazbaz: I heard other cites have an army to handle such threats. Perhaps we should vote to create one.
Player: vote
Barazbaz: Voting is the power of the people!
Player: sewers
Barazbaz: They are needed to keep the city clean.
Player: beggar
Barazbaz: There are only so few beggars, it's not even worth mentioning them.
Player: airtight cloth
Barazbaz: Thanks to this cloth, I was able to safely store away one of my most prized relics that would otherwise be lost to the mould. History is in the debt of the inventor.
Player: captain caveworm
Barazbaz: I tell you: everything related to that Captain Caveworm guy is made up out of some random events.
Player: maxxen
Barazbaz: When they did not choose him into the magistrate he let his golems loose in the city and fled.
Player: nightmare knights
Barazbaz: It's good such things are buried in the past.
Player: bye
Barazbaz: Yes, yes. Good bye.
