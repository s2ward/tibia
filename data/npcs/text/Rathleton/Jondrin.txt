Player: magistrate
Jondrin: The magistrate is what keeps things running smoothly.
Player: minotaurs
Jondrin: As if we hadn't enough problems already. The sooner we destroy them, the better.
Player: vote
Jondrin: I don't get it how other cities regulate stuff. One person ruling everything? Ridiculous!
Player: sewers
Jondrin: I guess we should have funded the sewer maintenance a bit more. Now it's a bit too late to patch things up.
Player: beggar
Jondrin: I fear they might carry vermin and illnesses with them. We should get rid of them for good.

Player: buy
Jondrin: Here it is.
Player: bye
Jondrin: Yeah, bye bye.
