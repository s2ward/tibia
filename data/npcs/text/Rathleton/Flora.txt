Player: hi
Flora: Greetings, Simula. Well, we all know what time it is. Always when we meet, the citizens of Rathleton voted for Bullwark! ...
Flora: Well, the rules are as simple as always. Ask me for a fight and I'll teleport you into the room with the lever, therefore I'll charge one voting right. ...
Flora: From this room there is no way back to me. Pull the trigger and after one minute you and your buddies will face Bullwark.
Player: Bullwark
Flora: A furious, devastating lump of meat and muscles. He is pure destruction. Take care!
Player: fight
Flora: Do you really want to enter Bullwark's hideout. There is no chickening out and I also have to charge one voting right! Yes or no?
Player: no
Flora: Return when you changed your mind.
Player: bye
Flora: Bye and return soon, Simula.
