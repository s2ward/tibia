Player: hi / hello  
Chavis: Hey there! You don't happen to have some food on you, you're willing to share? Well, where are my manners, a warm welcome for now.  
Player: minotaur  
Chavis: Only our city-guard stand between them and us.  
Player: beggar  
Chavis: Poor fellows. What else is to say?  
Player: sewer  
Chavis: We need the sewers to keep the city clean.  
Player: glooth  
Chavis: I'm not an expert on such issues. It's the stuff that makes things work.  
Player: food  
Chavis: I am sorry, you didn't harvest enough roots. You need to harvest a bundle of at least five roots - and please try doing it yourself.  
Player: Rathleton  
Chavis: Don't be fooled, we have here masters and servants like everywhere else. The whole system is a scam to subdue the masses, to fool them about what is really happening. ...  
Chavis: The system only ensures that the rich have a better control and the labourers are only used.  
Player: job  
Chavis: I run this poorhouse to provide some shelter and food for the more unfortunate souls in this city.  
Player: magistrate  
Chavis: They act so important but it is us common people who keep things going. There is a lot you can do in this city to earn a right to vote in the magistrate, though. So keep an eye out for everyone who needs help.  
Player: name  
Chavis: Sorry for not introducing myself. I'm Chavis. <bows  
Player: nightmare knights  
Chavis: If not some of them had failed, they would probably still run this isle instead of the magistrate.  
Player: roots  
Chavis: They are nutritious, cost nothing and are good for the body hair. If you can bring us bundles of five juicy roots each - we will make it worth your while for the magistrate.  
Player: vote  
Chavis: We are only allowed to vote for stuff that is of no interest for the rich guys.  
Player: bye  
Chavis: Take care out there!
