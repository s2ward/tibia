Klesar: I'm one of the scientists that the magistrate ordered here to keep the plant running smoothly.

Klesar: There is so much to do and so much to be learned. Every day here is an adventure on its own.

Player: minotaurs
Klesar: I admit I'm afraid of them. They say our gates are sure and adventurers like you would protect us - but they are so many. And they never give up.

Klesar: He had a brilliant mind and in my youth I was anxious to one day visit one of his classes. But there was this accident before I was grown up. ...

Player: captain caveworm
Klesar: I heard he recently stopped some death priest or something like that from sinking our whole isle to the ocean floor.
Player: stories
Klesar: People come and go. There is nothing out of the unusual bit the superstitious talk of workers.
Player: bye
Klesar: Good bye.
