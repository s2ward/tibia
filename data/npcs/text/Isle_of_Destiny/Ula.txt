Ula: Sorcs rule!
Ula: Wizards wield a mean staff!
Ula: Fry your foes!
Player: hi
Ula: Hi there! You should really check out Tylius' staff and rod training!
Player: name
Ula: Me? <giggles> I am Ula, magic assistant to the grand sorcerer Estrella and humble spectator at our festival.
Player: Ula
Ula: Yes? <giggles>
Player: estrella
Ula: She's awesome. She is our sorcerer vocation trainer on the Island of Destiny. ...
Ula: You should talk to her after the festival if you want to become a sorc, too.
Player: sorcerer
Ula: That's us! Casting magic since - um, always, actually! We're the coolest cats in any town. ...
Ula: I mean, cast fire and hurl death at your enemies? What's not to like about that? ...
Ula: Anyway, go visit Tylius next door here if you wish to know more stuff - like, how to use a staff <giggles>. It's really cool.
Player: magic
Ula: Really handy to keep all kinds of jerks at a distance, let me tell you! And it's quite the thing to impress cute boys, too. <giggles>
Player: tylius
Ula: He's sooo cute. <blushes> ...
Ula: I mean, he's an apprentice sorcerer, like me. He's in this tent right here. He's really good in staff and rod combat, you should totally check it out!
Player: bye
Ula: See you at the academy!
Player: (vanish)
Ula: Happy casting!
