Player: mill / flour
Evrard: Well, you can make some excellent flour here. Just put your grain under the millstone and and grind.
Player: bounac
Evrard: A fine place, we got everything we need here. There's traders for everything, a nice inn, a castle and even a cathedral. ...
Evrard: We also have a harbour but trade overseas is basically non-existent. And not exactly needed, I might add. ...
Evrard: Still, the siege has taken its toll on our fine city and its people.

Evrard: Drume and Fugue have caused quite a ruckus around here. This siege is very hard for Bounac and its people.
