Player: hi / hello  
Barney: Hello, but would you be so kind not to dig here, Player? This is my spot!  
Player: Cursed  
Barney: Listen, mate, the sun is shining, the sky is blue, and I really don't feel like talking about curses and ghosts.  
Player: Dig  
Barney: Yep, no treasure without digging. That's how it has always been and always will be.  
Player: Liberty Bay  
Barney: Except for the tavern I haven't seen much of Liberty Bay. I leave early and return late, life as a treasure hunter is hard.  
Player: Name  
Barney: I'm Barney.  
Player: Pirate  
Barney: They say that a bunch of cursed undead pirates roam this island sometimes. Spooky, isn't it?  
Player: Pirate treasure map  
Barney: Yes, get a treasure map from the pirates, keep it with you at all times and then just dig. Sooner or later you'll get lucky.  
Player: Sell  
Barney: Do I look like a merchant? If you need anything, check out the huts at the northern coast.  
Player: Shovel  
Barney: I think they are selling shovels here. However, I rather bring my own lucky shovel.  
Player: Spot / Treasure  
Barney: This island is famous for its hidden treasures. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm sure something must be here.  
Player: Treasure map  
Barney: Get your own treasure map, this one is mine! I think the ones sold here are sort of... well, you probably need a real pirate treasure map here.  
Player: War  
Barney: I don't know anything about a war.  
Player: bye / farewell  
Barney: Yes, yes, bye already.
