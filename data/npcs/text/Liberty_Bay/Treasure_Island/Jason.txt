Player: hi  
Jason: Hello, but would you be so kind not to dig here, PlYWE? This is my spot!  
Player: dig  
Jason: Yep, no treasure without digging. That's how it has always been and always will be.  
Player: spot  
Jason: This island is famous for its hidden treasures. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm sure something must be here.  
Player: job  
Jason: Job? I don't need a job anymore once I find my treasure.  
Player: name  
Jason: I'm Jason.  
Player: pirate  
Jason: They say that a bunch of cursed undead pirates roam this island sometimes. Spooky, isn't it?  
Player: liberty bay  
Jason: Except for the tavern I haven't seen much of Liberty Bay. I leave early and return late, life as a treasure hunter is hard.  
Player: treasure  
Jason: This island is famous for its hidden treasures. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm sure something must be here.  
Player: treasure map  
Jason: Get your own treasure map, this one is mine! I think the ones sold here are sort of... well, you probably need a real pirate treasure map here.  
Player: pirate treasure map  
Jason: Yes, get a treasure map from the pirates, keep it with you at all times and then just dig. Sooner or later you'll get lucky.  
Player: shovel  
Jason: I think they are selling shovels here. However, I rather bring my own lucky shovel.  
Player: war  
Jason: I don't know anything about a war.  
Player: curse / undead  
Jason: Listen, mate, the sun is shining, the sky is blue, and I really don't feel like talking about curses and ghosts.  
Player: sell  
Jason: Do I look like a merchant? If you need anything, check out the huts at the northern coast.  
Player: nargor  
Jason: Don't know what you're talking about.  
Player: sugar cane  
Jason: Who would waste any time harvesting and selling sugar cane if you can get instantly rich by finding a treasure?  
Player: bye / farewell  
Jason: Yes, yes, bye already.
