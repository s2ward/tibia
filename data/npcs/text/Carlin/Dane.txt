Dane: Have a nice warm milk, crystal clear water, or fresh lemonade in the Wave Cellar.  
Player: hi  
Dane: Welcome to the Wave Cellar, Player. Have a drink.  
Player: name  
Dane: I'm Dane.  
Player: time  
Dane: It's exactly horas.  
Player: job / saloon  
Dane: I'm the owner of this place of relaxation.  
Player: cellar  
Dane: It's pretty, isn't it?  
Player: news  
Dane: I heard nothing interesting lately.  
Player: drink / offer / sell  
Dane: I can offer you milk, water, and lemonade. Ask me for a trade if you need refreshments.  
Player: food  
Dane: Sorry, we just sell drinks.  
Player: alcohol / wine / beer  
Dane: Alcohol makes people too aggressive. We don't need such stuff in Carlin.  
Player: special  
Dane: Well, apart from not selling alcohol, you mean? I guess another specialty of Carlin are evergreen flower bowls.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: A sailor from Carlin told me that the natives of the Ice Islands pray to different gods. I think 'Chyll' is one of them or was that the name of the northern winds?? Well, doesn't matter! Primitives!  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard something about the fauna of the Ice Islands. The people tattle about birds that don't fly but swim!!! Isn't that ridiculous?!?!  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard it through the grapevine that the people on the Ice Islands eat fish all the time. But not only usual fish, no. They eat red and green fishes! ...  
Dane: ... The only green fish I know is the one you can buy at Permaret in Edron as a 'special offer' and that would be your last meal. Trust me!  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard about one guy, that is living in the capital of the Ice Islands, who has become crazy after searching the mines there. He always mumbles things about ancient demons and the end of the world.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: A friend of mine, Captain Ogden Brewboiler, travelled to the forgotten northern sea. He is an ambitious sailor but still I have a bad feeling about it. I hope he's doing well.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: The people talk about a huge mountain of ice, several hundreds of metres thick located in the centre of the main Ice Island.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: Have you heard about the natives of the Ice Islands? It sounds very confusing to me. ...  
Dane: ... I mean there are barbarians and barbarians, some are good, the others not. One call themselves 'Norsir' the others 'Raiders', but actually they are all the same.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: Some old people tell stories about the creation war and these islands in the North ruled by snow and ice. They say it once was a fertile region. Mighty magicians used a huge crystal of ice to store all the coldness inside.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard about dozens of sea serpents terrorising the sea around the islands in the North. ...  
Dane: ... It seems that this was the reason why nobody has discovered the Ice Islands before. Something must have happened because at a moment's notice they disappeared.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: A sailor told me a story about female raiders. He said they can talk to the beasts that live in the wilderness of the north. ...  
Dane: ... The wolves and bears protect them and tear their foes into pieces if they order them to. If you ask me, this is just gossip.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: A week ago an old drunkard mumbled something about hairy elephants!! I wonder who's telling all that weird stuff. I never met someone who was in the North and returned to the main continent.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard something about the barbarian tribes, who live on the newly discovered Ice Islands, that are called 'raiders'. The mightiest of them is headed by a shaman witch. There are rumours that she is immortal.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard that the town is mostly built out of wood. The inhabitants nearly stubbed all their forests. ...  
Dane: ... That must be the reason why the Carlin traders are so interested in getting there. They sense gold in selling wood.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard something about a civil war going on in the North. It seems that there are different tribes of 'raiders' making the whole area an even rougher place than it is already.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I received a letter from a friend who works on the Ice Islands. ...  
Dane: ... He was writing strange things about suspicious inhabitants and something about a test to become one of them. It was very hard to read the letter, I think he was drunk as hell when he wrote it.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: A guy told me that the Carlin Trading Syndicate sent out an employee to the new market in the North to open up a new branch of their company.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: Some citizens from Venore settled on one of the islands in the North. I heard stories about exotic products they are gathering from their hunts.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: The Carlin Trading Syndicate is sending expedition after expedition to the new discovered islands in the north. ...  
Dane: ... I heard that they dig for valuable ore which was found in an old mine. I wonder why nobody of them has returned yet.  
Player: rumour  
Dane: I heard about some strange creatures that appeared on one of the smaller ice islands. Reportedly they have a human torso but the lower body of a white-furred goat! Can you imagine that? ...  
Dane: Travellers told me that they recently moved into the caverns beneath the island. There, they are growing fresh grass and even flowers! How is that possible in a frozen cave? Some kind of magic has to be involved. ...  
Dane: I'm just not sure whether it is of the benevolent or the malicious kind.  
Player: bye  
Dane: Please come back from time to time.
