Player: hi  
Chip: Please don't keep me from my work.  
Player: work / job  
Chip: Shh... I don't really have a job. I need the wood I chop here, though.  
Player: wood  
Chip: Yeah, to be honest, it's not really my wood. It belongs to the queen. But what choice do I have?  
Player: queen  
Chip: Queen Eloise from Carlin likely wouldn't approve. Be so kind to keep this little secret to yourself.  
Player: choice  
Chip: Those bandits have my wife and kids. If I don't bring wood, I don't know what they'll do. Hell, I'd even trade some with you if you had any.  
Player: bandits  
Chip: They hide somewhere near the Plains of Havoc. I've never seen their hideout, though, they just send me messages and tell me where to leave the wood.  
Player: trade  
Chip: If you have a piece of wood, I'd give you some money for it. I don't have much, but I'd appreciate your help.  
Player: buy  
Chip: I need all the wood I can get. My hands and my back are already aching from all the chopping. If you have any for trade, let me know.  
Player: sell  
Chip: I don't have anything for sale.  
Player: name  
Chip: People call me Chip.  
Player: bye  
Chip: Probably better that way.
