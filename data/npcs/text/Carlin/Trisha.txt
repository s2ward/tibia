Player: hi  
Trisha: Welcome home, knight Player! Need new spells? I can teach you.  
Player: addon  
Trisha: Are you talking about my spiky shoulder pad? You can't buy one of these. They have to be earned.  
Player: earn  
Trisha: I'm not sure if you are enough of a hero to earn them. You could try, though. What do you think?  
Player: yes  
Trisha: Okay, who knows, maybe you have a chance. A really small one though. Listen up: ...  
Trisha: First, you have to prove your guts by bringing me 100 hardened bones. ...  
Trisha: Next, if you actually managed to collect that many, please complete a small task for our guild and bring us 100 turtle shells. ...  
Trisha: It is said that excellent shields can be created from these. ...  
Trisha: Alright, um, afterwards show me that you have fighting spirit. Any true hero needs plenty of that. ...  
Trisha: The last task is the hardest. You will need to bring me a claw from a mighty dragon king. ...  
Trisha: Did you understand everything I told you and are willing to handle this task?  
Player: yes  
Player: hardened bones  
Trisha: How are you faring with your mission? Have you collected all 100 hardened bones?  
Player: yes  
Trisha: I'm surprised. That's pretty good for a man. Now, bring us the 100 turtle shells.  
Player: turtle shells  
Trisha: Did you get us 100 turtle shells so we can make new shields?  
Player: yes  
Trisha: Well done - for a man. These shells are enough to build many strong new shields. Thank you! Now - show me fighting spirit.  
Player: fighting spirit  
Trisha: So, can you show me your fighting spirit?  
Player: yes  
Trisha: Correct - pretty smart for a man. But the hardest task is yet to come: the claw from a lord among the dragon lords.  
Player: dragon claw  
Trisha: Have you actually managed to obtain the red dragon claw I asked for?  
Player: yes  
Trisha: You did it! I have seldom seen a man as courageous as you. I really have to say that you deserve to wear a spike. Go ask Cornelia to adorn your armour.  
Player: bye  
Trisha: Don't hurt yourself with that weapon, little one.
