Player: Hi  
Alia: Welcome Player! Welcome to the temple of Carlin. If you need healing, I can help you.  
Player: Job / temple  
Alia: I'm a nun, serving the gods of Tibia in this temple. I also heal wounded adventurers.  
Player: Gods  
Alia: They created Tibia and all life on it.  
Player: Tibia  
Alia: That's where we are. Tibia is our world.  
Player: Life / Crunor  
Alia: Crunor is one of the favoured gods in our city, especially the druids venerate him.  
Alia: You do not need any healing right now.  
Player: Carlin  
Alia: Carlin is a place of peace and prosperity thanks to the guidance of our beloved queen.  
Player: Thais  
Alia: Thais is a rough city with rough habits. It's a pity they don't learn from us.  
Player: Venore  
Alia: The Venoreans are quite aggressive. They show only little interest in the teachings of the gods. Most people there only worship money.  
Player: Name  
Alia: My name is Alia.  
Player: Time  
Alia: Now, it is 0:00 pm. You should consider buying a watch.  
Player: Zathroth  
Alia: The Zathroth cult is forbidden in our city.  
Player: Dwarfs / Dwarves  
Alia: The dwarfs are a strange race. Despite their odd religion and their somewhat rude manners, they are brave and honest people.  
Player: Elves  
Alia: The nature-loving elves like to exchange knowledge with our druids. Still, it troubles me that they don't acknowledge the true gods.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Alia: Don't mention this name here.  
Player: Excalibug  
Alia: Sorry, I can't help you with that.  
Player: Ghostlands  
Alia: Uh, don't ask. That's a place even the brave women of Carlin don't dare to explore!!!  
Player: Bye  
Alia: May the gods be with you, Player!
