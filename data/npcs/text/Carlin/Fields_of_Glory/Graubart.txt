Player: hi
Graubart: Ahoi, young (man / lady) Player. Looking for work on my ship?
Player: name
Graubart: My name is Graubart, captain of the great Seahawk!
Player: job / live
Graubart: I'm a merchant. I sail all over the world with my ship and trade with many different races!
Player: merchant
Graubart: A merchant is someone who trades goods with other people and tries to make a little profit. *laughs*
Player: work
Graubart: I'm sorry, but it is too dangerous nowadays. Too many storms out there. Too dangerous for the ship. Come back in some months and we will see.
Player: ship / seahawk
Graubart: Ah, my whole proud: My ship named Seahawk. We rode out so many stormy nights together. I think I couldn't live without it.
Player: races
Graubart: You know; elves, dwarfs, lizardmen, minotaurs and many others.
Player: bruno
Graubart: Bruno is one of the best sailors I know. He is nearly as good as me. *laughs loudly*
Player: aneus
Graubart: Hmm, I don't know him very well. But he has a very nice story to tell.
Player: marlene
Graubart: Pssst. Marlene is not near right now...? You know... she is a lovely woman, but she talks too much! So I always try to keep distance from her because she can't stop talking.
Player: trade
Graubart: I trade nearly everything, for example weapons, food, water, and even magic runes.
Player: weapons / water / magic runes
Graubart: Sorry, sold out.
Player: food
Graubart: Sorry, sold out. Ask Bruno.
Player: bye
Graubart: Good bye and don't forget me!
