Player: Hi  
Dalbrect: Be greeted, traveler. Welcome to my hut.  
Player: Job  
Dalbrect: I am merely a humble fisher now that nothing is left of my noble legacy.  
Player: Legacy  
Dalbrect: Once my family was once noble and wealthy, but fate turned against us and threw us into poverty.  
Player: Poverty / Fate  
Dalbrect: When Carlin tried to colonize the region now known as the ghostlands, my ancestors put their fortune in that project.  
Player: Ghostlands  
Dalbrect: Our family fortune was lost when the colonization of those cursed lands failed. Now nothing is left of our fame or our fortune. If I only had something as a reminder of those better times. <sigh>  
Player: Brooch  
Dalbrect: What? You want me to examine a brooch?  
Player: No  
Dalbrect: Then stop being a fool. I am poor and I have to work the whole day through!  
Player: Name  
Dalbrect: My name is Dalbrect Windtrouser, of the once proud windtrouser family.  
Player: Carlin  
Dalbrect: To think my family used to belong to the local nobility! And now those arrogant women are in charge!  
Player: Passage  
Dalbrect: I have only sailed to the isle of the kings once or twice. I dare not anger the monks by bringing travellers there without their permission.  
Player: Bye  
Dalbrect: Good bye. You are welcome.
