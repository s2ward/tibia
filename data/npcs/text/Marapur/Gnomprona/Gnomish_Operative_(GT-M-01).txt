Player: hi
Gnomish Operative: Hello! Please let's hurry and proceed with the operation, so we can get out as soon as possible!
Player: name
Gnomish Operative: If you are tardy you can call me gnomcrispy soon enough.
Player: job
Gnomish Operative: I'm in the unfortunate position of overseeing this insanely hot part of our operation.
Player: news
Gnomish Operative: The news is: HURRY!
Player: time
Gnomish Operative: It seems it's some minutes before I'm 'well done'.
Player: operation
Gnomish Operative: Let's go through this quick. In this cave we discovered certain magma crystals that are attuned to the volcanic core and seem to be part of the process that heats it up.
Player: crystals
Gnomish Operative: The crystals must be destroyed. We hope that has a positive influence on the core's stability and heat level. ...
Gnomish Operative: The problem is, they heat up the area around them to insane levels. ...
Gnomish Operative: We can provide you with some gnomish heat protection. Just use the crystal machine to charge your shield. ...
Gnomish Operative: The shield will begin to detoriate rapidly as soon as you are in the superheated area. ...
Gnomish Operative: Better have an eye on your heat protection and plan your way back too. As soon as the shield runs out, you will take massive damage. ...
Gnomish Operative: If your heatshield is low, better leave the superheated area and get a new shield charge. ...
Gnomish Operative: It might take a few runs to get those pesky crystals destroyed. You need to destroy all three of them, so we can see if it does what our scientists expect.
Player: bye
Gnomish Operative: Good bye.
