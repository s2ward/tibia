Player: hi
Gnomish Operative: Hello! Good you are here to assist in our operation!
Player: name
Gnomish Operative: I'm too unimportant to mention my name.
Player: job
Gnomish Operative: I'm a gnomish archeologist and I am overseeing this part of our operation.
Player: time
Gnomish Operative: It's 9:18 am right now.
Player: news
Gnomish Operative: The biggest news is waiting just around the corner so to say.
Player: operation
Gnomish Operative: In this tunnel awaits one of the greatest discoveries in gnomish archaeology.
Player: archaeology
Gnomish Operative: Our devices hint at some artificial structure in the depths of this cave. ...
Gnomish Operative: And there is a source of strange energy emissions in that structure. ...
Gnomish Operative: Sadly fires are constantly blocking our way. There is a way through the fires as they are waxing and waning, but it is still dangerous. ...
Gnomish Operative: There is gnomish heat protection technology, yet it is expensive and restricted. ...
Gnomish Operative: Unless we can prove that it's worth the effort, we won't get the protection we need for a safe exploration. ...
Gnomish Operative: We need you to verify that there is indeed an ancient structure and some device in this cave. ...
Gnomish Operative: Don't worry, if you get caught in the heat you'll be retrieved to safety. Yet you will have to make it through that tunnel at some point.
Player: bye
Gnomish Operative: Good bye.
