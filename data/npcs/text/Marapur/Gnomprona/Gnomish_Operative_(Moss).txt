Player: hi
Gnomish Operative (Moss): Ah, there you are. I hope we can continue the operation.
Player: name
Gnomish Operative: Let's keep our relation on a professional level.
Player: job
Gnomish Operative: I'm a gnomisch archeologist and I am overseeing this part of our operation.
Player: time
Gnomish Operative: It's 5:22 am.
Player: operation
Gnomish Operative: While we did our excavation here we have run into some minor issues.
Player: issues
Gnomish Operative: Oh, well, there are the raging beasts that pass through the cave for some odd reason, you really wouldn't want to get run over by one or step into their -uhm- leftovers ...
Gnomish Operative: And then there are the sulphur holes, their stench can make even a grown gnome be rebuffed. ...
Gnomish Operative: The stalagmites are just a minor inconvenience in comparison. ...
Gnomish Operative: However before all that commotion started in the cave we located an obviously artificial flame in the far north. ...
Gnomish Operative: It isn't harmful. As far as we can tell the energy it provides seems quite useful. ...
Gnomish Operative: So I need you to retrieve three samples of the flame energy and donate them to the extractor apparatus here. ...
Gnomish Operative: Yet any disturbance you might get hit with, will discharge the flames energy and you'll have to recharge yourself. ...
Gnomish Operative: Of course I'd do it personally but ... the apparatus here requires my attendance and you are more expen... I mean you can extend your legs wider.
Player: bye
Gnomish Operative: Good bye.
