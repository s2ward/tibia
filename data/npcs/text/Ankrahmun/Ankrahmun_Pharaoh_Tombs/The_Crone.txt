The Crone: I don't remember my name, neither my days as a mortal.

The Crone: Once I was Vashresamun's favourite handmaid. But I have fallen from grace and now I'm exiled from her tomb.  
Player: grace / fallen / exiled  
The Crone: Don't ask about it, mortal. Memories bring too much grief.  
Player: vashresamun  
The Crone: I mourn the dark day I was exiled from her tomb.  
Player: tomb  
The Crone: Her tomb is sealed and can only be entered with a certain melody.

The Crone: Vashresamun erased the memory of the tune from my mind, I only remember its name: The Secret of the Rose Garden.  
Player: bye / farewell  
The Crone: Good bye.
