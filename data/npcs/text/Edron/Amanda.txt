Player: army / banor  
Amanda: Our army lives in accordance with the ideals of the god Banor.  
Player: edron  
Amanda: Edron is in grave danger. I arrived here too late to witness the events myself, but I will share everything with you that I've heard ...  
Amanda: A false priestess seduced some knights to abandon their noble cause and to free some prisoners. Then they headed to some ruins in the North where they practice a dark cult and consort with demons.  
Player: ruins  
Amanda: The ruins are probably older than humankind. We have to assume it's a place of dark power. The recent appearances of the fiend Orshabaal hint that the Ruthless Seven are somehow involved.  
Player: orshabaal  
Amanda: The taint he spreads on the land is unbearable. This creature has to be destroyed once and for all.  
Player: ruthless seven  
Amanda: I'm not sure if they even exist. Demons usually don't form such partnerships.  
Player: demons  
Amanda: It takes heroes to defeat demons!  
Player: heroes  
Amanda: Heroes gain equipment and experience by fulfilling dangerous quests.  
Player: tibia  
Amanda: That's our world.  
Player: thais  
Amanda: We can expect little help from Thais in these troubled days. We need some heroes to help us with these sinister things going on here.  
Player: god  
Amanda: They created the world and all life on it.  
Player: bye  
Amanda: Farewell, Player!
