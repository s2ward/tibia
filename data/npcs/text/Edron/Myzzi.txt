Myzzi:  I have to find some heroes. Find, find, find!!  
Player: hi  
Myzzi: Hello adventurer. It is good to see you.  
Player: good  
Myzzi: I'm just a mere messenger and I'm here to find brave adventurers that might help my friends in this time of need.  
Player: help  
Myzzi: Lady Alivar of the Summer Court and Lord Cadion of the Winter Court are in need of brave adventurers to avert a great threat for the whole world.  
Player: threat  
Myzzi: I know only little and I forget so much. So many things going around my mind! ...  
Myzzi: However, I can grant you access to the Courts of Summer and Winter if you promise to help! There you can meet with Undal or Vanys, the servants of Lord Cadion and Lady Alivar. They will be able to tell you more about the issue.  
Player: entrances  
Myzzi: So, are you willing to help in this time of need?  
Player: no  
Myzzi: Oh no, oh no! What a pity! Please reconsider!  
Player: yes  
Myzzi: You are a true hero! Here, take my enchantment and you will be able to pass the portals. Now hurry, my friends are waiting.  
Myzzi: Hello adventurer. I'm so happy that you agreed to help!  
Player: bye  
Myzzi: Goodbye, Player.
