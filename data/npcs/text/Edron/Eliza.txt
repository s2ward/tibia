Player: hi  
Eliza: Welcome, Player. If you're interested in spells to support your party, I can be your teacher.  
Player: spells  
Eliza: I have 'Train Party' for Knights, 'Protect Party' for Paladins, 'Heal Party' for Druids and 'Enchant Party' for Sorcerers. You can only use these spells if you are in a party with others.  
Player: teacher / job  
Eliza: I'm a teacher for party spells. That's party spells as in 'support your party members', and not 'how to get people to love your birthday party'. Just to be clear.  
Player: name  
Eliza: My name is Eliza.  
Player: curse / moon / were  
Eliza: I have no idea, I'm sorry. You could ask Fiona or Zoltan, though.  
Player: party  
Eliza: Having a party is a good thing. You can kill much stronger monsters than when you're on your own.  
Player: edron  
Eliza: Talented magicians gather in these towers and work together in researching spells. That's why the most powerful spells are only taught in Edron.  
Player: thais  
Eliza: I've only been to Thais once or twice. I prefer a quieter place to live and study.  
Player: carlin  
Eliza: I don't like the attitude of the women there. They are all a little trigger-happy, if you know what I mean.  
Player: king / tibianus  
Eliza: The king is a quite impressive man. Even though his deeds are often criticised, I'm sure that he only wants the best for Tibia.  
Player: tibia  
Eliza: People call me pessimistic, but I think this world will go down the drain sooner or later.  
Player: news / rumours  
Eliza: Well, the new spells we recently discovered could prove to be quite valuable. Time will tell.  
Player: time  
Eliza: It's 6:51 pm.  
Player: bye  
Eliza: Goodbye, Player.
