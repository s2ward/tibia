Arkulius: Oh my! Alverus!! Did you really...?!?! I have to recalculate it to make sure that I made no mistake.  
Arkulius: ...the arithmetical paradox has the same value in a metaphysical way, then...  
Arkulius: Yes, that's it! The elementary particle are corresponding to the... the ... UNBELIEVEABLE!!!  
Arkulius: ...the minimum square deviation could cause a dislocation, in a matter of fact...  
Arkulius: <mumbles>  
Arkulius: ...it could be possible to bring the sphere to a destination where...  
Player: hi (o NPC responde aleatoriamente de diferentes maneiras)  
1. Arkulius: ...if my calculations are correct, I will be able to revive... Arrgghh!! What do you want?  
2. Arkulius: ...if the expected constant is higher than... Hmmm, who are you?? What do you want?  
3. Arkulius: ...then I could transform a spell to bend... How can anyone expect me to work under these conditions?? What do you want?  
Player: want / job  
Arkulius: How dare you asking me this?!? I'm Arkulius - Master of Elements, the HEADMASTER of this academy!!  
Player: name  
Arkulius: I'm Arkulius - Master of Elements, the headmaster of this academy.  
Player: time  
Arkulius: Time is an illusion and completely irrelevant to me.  
Player: thanks / thank you  
Arkulius: You're welcome. Are you leaving now? Hopefully <sighs>.  
Player: element  
Arkulius: The doctrine of elementalism is a very complex topic. Only the eldest may understand what it's all about. My dear friend Alverus took it way too far.  
Player: alverus  
Arkulius: It happened while he carried out an experiment concerning the creation of the elemental shrines. I still get goose bumps just by thinking of it. ...  
Arkulius: You need to know about the process of creating an elemental shrine to understand it completely, but I don't want to go into detail now. ...  
Arkulius: Anyway, his spell had a different outcome than he had planned. He accidentally created an Ice Overlord, pure living elemental ice, who froze him in a blink of an eye.  
Player: ice overlord  
Arkulius: We presumed their existence all these years but we were never able to prove it. Well, ironically my friend Alverus provided results by letting himself transform into a block of ice that can't be disenchanted.  
Player: shrine  
Arkulius: The creation of the elemental shrines is a really complex matter. They are actually nodes, locations where the matching elemental sphere is very close. ...  
Arkulius: The shrine itself is like a portal between our world and the elemental sphere and enables us to use the elemental energy emerging from it.  
Player: sphere  
Arkulius: There are four spheres we know of: ice, fire, earth and energy. ....<mumbles> Hmmm, should I ask or not?....The heck with it! Now that you know about the spheres ...  
Arkulius: I found a way to visit them. It's VERY dangerous and there is a decent chance that you won't come back BUT if you succeed you'll write history!!! Ask me about that mission if you're interested.  
Player: bye  
Arkulius: At last! Good things come to those who wait.
