The Thaian: Welcome to my little tavern!
The Thaian: Come, take a seat! Or... oh, I see. Feel free to just stand there!
The Thaian: ANOTHER RABBIT, HMPF. OR IS IT A FOX? A BAT?! STAY OUT!
Player: hi
The Thaian: Greetings to you, weary traveller! Do you want something to eat or drink?
Player: name
The Thaian: My name is of no importance, traveller.
Player: job
The Thaian: I'm a tavern keeper. I own a tavern. You are standing in it right now. So do you want something to eat, drink or what?
Player: eat
The Thaian: Well, here you go then.
Player: drink
The Thaian: To your health!
Player: tavern
The Thaian: It's a fine refuge, don't you think? You can eat, drink and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere to your heart's content!
Player: crystal
The Thaian: There are crystals manifold in the hall of refulgence. Yet the eye, the eye of the chasm is the most important - the one important thing. Worth... to me... and me alone, more than anything.
Player: the eye of the chasm
The Thaian: The eye of the chasm. It is the one thing worth anything in this world. It's... it... what do you know about it? No, you don't know anything about the eye! Hmpf!
Player: king
The Thaian: The king? Er, yes. Our good king. Xenom... he is - oh, I mean he was - a... proud and just ruler. No? Oh, you mean Ti... Tibianus? Of course... yes, very well then.
Player: greed
The Thaian: Don't be... no good can ever come of it.
Player: edron
The Thaian: Edron? Oh this place. Yes, it is a very fine... location. I myself am from Thais, you know. A big metropolis. But it was too busy, too loud. I much prefer the countryside.
Player: bye
The Thaian: Farewell, traveller!
The Thaian: Off you go then!
