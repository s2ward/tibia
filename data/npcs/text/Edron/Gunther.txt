Gunther: Oh my!
Gunther: They have to believe me!
Gunther: What a mess.
Player: hi
Gunther: Greetings adventurer!
Player: name
Gunther: My name is Gunther Holz.
Player: job
Gunther: I am an overseas-trader by trade.
Player: time
Gunther: Our time might be running out!
Player: adventurer
Gunther: I hoped to meet an adventurer such as you! No one is listening to me, they claim I am mad, but I am not!
Player: mad
Gunther: Yes, YES! I've seen IT!
Player: seen
Gunther: It was a plant! On open seas!!! I swear! And it was humongous!
Player: humongous
Gunther: It was as big as a castle! And that was only the part I could see over water! And it moved!!!
Player: moved
Gunther: Yes it was slowly but steadily heading straight for the mainland.
Player: mainland
Gunther: I can't tell where or when it arrives at the shores. But somewhere at some point it will! And it will be a disaster!
Player: disaster
Gunther: Can you imagine the damage a gigantic walking plant will cause? It will raze cities, stomp out armies! It has to be stopped!
Player: stopped
Gunther: I called in a few favours from the adventurer's guild and the explorer society to fund an expedition to seek out that monster. ...
Gunther: All I need now is some brave souls to man the ships and destroy that monster!
Player: souls
Gunther: Say, will you be one of the heroes to save the day? Yes or no?
Player: no
Gunther: By the gods! Please reconsider!
Player: yes
Gunther: I knew you had it in you! Please hurry, talk to the captain and tell him Gunther sent you!
Player: souls
Gunther: I am so glad, you are taking care of this problem.
Player: bye
Gunther: Take care, friend!
