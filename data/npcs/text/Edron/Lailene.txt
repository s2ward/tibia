Player: hi / hello  
Lailene: What do you want in my magical robe store? I doubt I have anything that's of interest to you.  
Player: brotherhood / bones  
Lailene: ... what?! Uh - no, no. Of course I wouldn't have anything to do with... them.  
Player: curse / moon / were  
Lailene: I'm an expert on magical robes and hats. But curses are not my subject. You should ask Milos or Luna about this.  
Player: Edron  
Lailene: Yeah, what about it?  
Player: hat  
Lailene: Currently I only buy batwing hats. Ask me for a trade if you want to sell one.  
Player: job  
Lailene: I sell and buy magical robes and hats. My customers usually appreciate that I don't ask where they got the robes from they're selling to me.  
Player: name  
Lailene: Lailene. That's enough.  
Player: news  
Lailene: Good news for me would be if you either left or bought something.  
Player: Random Word  
Lailene: Excuse me, but I'm here to trade and not to chatter. If you're not interested in my wares, don't disturb me continuing my experiments.  
Player: robe / ware / stuff / goods / equipment / offer / buy / sell  
Lailene: I sell and buy magical robes and hats. My inventory is still small, but I'm confident that it will grow over time. Ask me for a trade to have a look.  
Player: time  
Lailene: It's time you stopped bugging me.  
Player: trade  
Lailene: Here.  
Player: bye  
Lailene: See ya, Player.
