Player: hi  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Be greeted mortal! Be on guard, dire times are at hand.  
Player: guard  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Malignant forces from beyond our world are rampaging through reality and threatening existence itself.  
Player: Malignant  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Forces beyond our comprehension are tearing on our world. It is their intention to unmake reality. What we see here is only a symptom of an illness that has befallen existence.  
Player: reality  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Everything you see and experience is only a small part of reality. Most of it is beyond your grasp and comprehension. The invisible and more fragile parts of reality are the ones that suffer most right now.  
Player: existence  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: The boundaries have been weakened and destructive forces are pouring into our realm. The vortex that you see is only one of many and it is slowly weakening our world.  
Player: comprehension  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: An unspeakable thing that was not meant to be and that lurked in a place that does not exist has been foolishly allowed into our world. ...  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: What you see here is only the fallout of its worming its way into existence and yet, the thing is that unfathomable that the process is tearing the world apart.  
Player: world  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Each incursion is hurting the world, eating away its strength. But creation is strong and can heal and recover over time. ...  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Yet you will have to weaken the incursions as much as you can to give the world the needed time to heal.  
Player: vortex  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: The vortex is actually a wound. The devouring nothing lies beyond. Only by destroying the minions from beyond and entering the vortex, the dreadful force behind it all might be stopped.  
Player: heal  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Healing takes time and strength. The lesser the damage caused by the incursions, the lesser time and strength is needed to heal. ...  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Eventually, though, the world will succumb to its wounds unless the potency of the incursions can be weakened significantly.  
Player: significantly  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Only by entering the Heart of Destruction and by challenging the devourer of the worlds, the incursions can be weakened. But that is for another to reveal.  
Player: Heart  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: It's not for me to discuss this.  
Player: devourer  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: It's not for me to discuss this.  
Player: force  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: The dreadful knowledge will taint your soul soon enough. For now, it is sufficient to say it is an enemy of life and existence.  
Player: minions  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: This vortex is only a minor incursion. To truly challenge the powers from beyond, you'll have to enter a more threatening incursion. ...  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Still, your help is valuable. We can't allow such incursion to occur without resistance. ...  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: By entering the vortex and slaying the creatures there, you'll reduce the toll it takes from reality.  
Player: bye  
Lesser Messenger of Heaven: Farewell!
