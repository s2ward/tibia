Ursula: Howdy Player. I'm a spell teacher of the Edron academy.  
Player: spell (se for knight)  
Ursula: Sorry, but we had a slight restructuring of spell lessons in order to be able to focus better on one group of students. Go see Puffels and Zoltan for your spells.

Player: name  
Ursula: I am Ursula.
