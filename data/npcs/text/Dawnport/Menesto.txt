Player: hi  
Menesto: Finally, reinforcements - oh but no, you came through the crystal portal, like the others! I am Ser Menesto, I guard the portal. That beast caught me by surprise, I lost my dagger and had to retreat. ...  
Menesto: ... ...  
Menesto: Hmm. ...  
Menesto: You look hungry, you should eat something. Remember to eat regularly to regain your strength! See what you can find while hunting. Or buy food in a city shop. Here, have some of my rations, I'll take my dagger. Tell me when you're ready.  
Player: ready  
Menesto: Good. I'll stay here till reinforcements come. Go up the ladder to reach the surface. You'll need a rope for the ropespot that comes after the ladder - here, take my spare equipment. ...  
Menesto: And remember: Tibia is a world with many dangers and mysteries, so be careful! Farewell, friend.
