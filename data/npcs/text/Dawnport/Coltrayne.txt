Player: hi  
Coltrayne: Hey there. Need some armor or weapon? Then ask me for a trade.  
Player: trade  
Coltrayne: Here you go. You can also have a look at armor or weapons only.  
Player: job  
Coltrayne: I'm a blacksmith by trade. Want to keep our lads and lasses safe and equipped with a sharp blade, me.  
Player: name  
Coltrayne: Coltrayne Daggard. Just ask me for a trade to see the latest in chain mail and weapons.  
Player: rookgaard  
Coltrayne: You mean to imply I am an inexperienced guardian? Get out of here.  
Player: Coltrayne  
Coltrayne: Yes. You wish to trade I guess. At least, you look like you could use some good gear, kid.  
Player: Garamond  
Coltrayne: Don't have much to say about him. Barely know him. Seems a decent spell teacher for mages.  
Player: Hamish  
Coltrayne: Good at potions. Likes experimenting. Can kit you out with magical equipment for a hunt.  
Player: Inigo  
Coltrayne: Gives newcomers hints how we do things here in Tibia. Don't know how to use something? Ask Inigo.  
Player: Mr Morris  
Coltrayne: He had a plan, as usual. Came here, set up the outpost, managed everything. Looking for a task or quest? He's your man.  
Player: Oressa  
Coltrayne: She's our local healer. Downstairs in the temple and oracle room, that's where she is. Just say 'heal' or 'help' and she'll help ya if you really need it.  
Player: Plunderpurse  
Coltrayne: Pirates and gold, you get the rest. Hoards gold now for young adventurers - keeps it safe while you go out hunting.  
Player: Richard  
Coltrayne: He's just in the next shop to the left, selling food and equipment like ropes and shovels and fishing rods and such.  
Player: Ser Tybald  
Coltrayne: I'm sure I've seen his face before somewhere... never mind. Anyway, he's the knight and paladin spell teacher around here, letting you try them out for free. Don't underestimate the use of spells, even if you're not a mage.
