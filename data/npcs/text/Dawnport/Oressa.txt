Player: Hi  
Oressa: Welcome to the temple of Dawnport, child. If you need healing, I can help you. Ask me about a vocation if you need counsel.  
Player: Name  
Oressa: I am Oressa Fourwinds, the healer.  
Player: Job  
Oressa: I can heal you if you are hurt. I can also help you choose your vocation.  
Player: Healer  
Oressa: If you are hurt my child, I will heal your wounds.  
Player: Vocation / choose  
Oressa: A vocation is your profession and destiny, determining your skills and way of fighting. There are four vocations in Tibia: knight, sorcerer, paladin or druid. Each one has its unique special abilities. ...  
Oressa: When you leave the outpost through one of the four gates upstairs, you will be equipped with training gear of a specific vocation in order to defend yourself against the monsters outside. ...  
Oressa: You can try them out as often as you wish to. When you have gained enough experience to reach level 8, you are ready to choose the definite vocation that is to become your destiny. ...  
Oressa: Think carefully, as you can't change your vocation later on! You will have to choose your vocation in order to leave Dawnport for the main continent through one of these doors behind me. ...  
Oressa: Talk to me again when you are ready to choose your vocation, and I will set you on your way.  
Player: Knight  
Oressa: Knights are stalwart melee fighters, the toughest of all vocations. They can take more damage and carry more items than the other vocations, but they will deal less damage than paladins, druids or sorcerers. ...  
Oressa: Knights can wield one- or two-handed swords, axes and clubs, and they can cast a few spells to draw a monster's attention to them. ...  
Oressa: If you want to be a tough melee fighter who can resist much longer than anyone else, you should consider choosing the knight vocation.  
Player: Sorcerer  
Oressa: Sorcerers are powerful casters of death, energy and fire magic. They can do a little ice or earth damage as well. ...  
Oressa: Sorcerers cannot take much damage or carry many items, but they deal more damage than paladins or knights, and can target several enemies. ...  
Oressa: If you wish to be a caster of fire and energy, hurling death magic at your foes, you should consider choosing the sorcerer vocation.  
Player: Paladin  
Oressa: Paladins are sturdy distance fighters. They are tougher than druids or sorcerers and can carry more items, but they are less tough than a knight. ...  
Oressa: Paladins have the longest attack range, and can deal the most damage on a single target. ...  
Oressa: They can also use holy magic to slay the unholy and undead in particular. ...  
Oressa: If you like to keep a distance to your enemy, shooting while you outdistance him, you should consider choosing the paladin vocation.  
Player: Druid  
Oressa: Druids are healers and powerful masters of ice and earth magic. They can also do a little energy, fire or death damage as well. ...  
Oressa: Druids cannot take much damage or carry many items, but they deal more damage than paladins or knights, and can target several enemies. ...  
Oressa: If you wish to be a healer and wielder of powerful natural magic, you should consider choosing the druid vocation.  
Player: Doors  
Oressa: Behind each of those doors, the equipment and skills of one vocation lies - sorcerer, paladin, knight or druid. ...  
Oressa: When you have reached level 8, you can choose your definite vocation. You have to talk to me to receive it, and then you may open one of the doors, take up your vocation's gear, and leave the island. But be aware: ...  
Oressa: Once you have chosen your vocation and stepped through a door, you cannot go back or choose a different vocation. So choose well!  
Player: Inigo  
Oressa: He has seen much, and likes to help the younger ones. If you have questions about what to do, or whom to ask for anything, go to Inigo.  
Player: Richard  
Oressa: Found a new way of living and took to it like a fish to water.  
Player: Coltrayne  
Oressa: Ah. Some wounds never heal. <sighs> Shipwrecked in body and mind. Nowhere to go, so he doesn't leave.  
Player: Morris  
Oressa: He broods over problems he won't share. But maybe you can help him with a little quest or two.  
Player: Hamish  
Oressa: He lives only for his experiments and potions.  
Player: Dawnport  
Oressa: This is a strange place. Many beings are called to it. I dreamed of it long before I came here. ...  
Oressa: Something spoke to me, telling me I had to be its voice; a voice of the Oracle here for the sake of the adventurers that would come to defend Tibia against evil and need to choose their destiny.  
Player: Rookgaard  
Oressa: I have heard of it, yes.  
Player: Bye  
Oressa: Good bye, child.
