Player: Hi  
Amber: Oh hello, nice to see you Player.  
Player: How are you?  
Amber: I'm recovering from a sea passage.  
Player: Job  
Amber: I'm an explorer who seeks adventures.  
Player: Adventure  
Amber: I fought fierce monsters, climbed the highest mountains, explored the deepest dungeons and crossed the sea on a raft.  
Player: Sea  
Amber: My voyage on the sea was exhausting. The weather was bad, the waves high and my raft quite simple. There's a certain excitement to it, though.  
Player: Explore  
Amber: I've been almost everywhere in Tibia.  
Player: Tibia  
Amber: I'm trying to explore each spot of Tibia, and one day I'll have seen it all.  
Player: Time  
Amber: Sorry, I lost my watch in a storm.  
Player: Dungeon  
Amber: I had no time to explore the dungeons of this isle yet, but I've seen two big caves in the East, and there is a ruined tower to the north-west. Oh, and there're the sewers.  
Player: Sewer  
Amber: I like sewers. I made my very first battle experience in the sewers below Thais. The small sewer system of Rookgaard has some nasty rats to fight.  
Player: King  
Amber: King Tibianus is the ruler of Thais. The island of Rookgaard belongs to his kingdom.  
Player: Rookgaard  
Amber: It's a nice little island on which you can learn how to fight. I can see it in your eyes - you want to become a famous adventurer and explorer just like me!  
Player: Academy  
Amber: A fine institution, but it needs definitely more funds from the king.  
Player: Help / information  
Amber: Well, I can give you general hints or tell you about my adventures and many other topics. Oh, and if you are bored, I might have a small quest for you.  
Player: Destiny  
Amber: You will find your destiny. I'm sure it's something big and important.  
Player: Thais  
Amber: A fine city, but the king has some problems enforcing the law.  
Player: Main  
Amber: You'll be surprised once you leave this island. The world outside there is gigantic.  
Player: Castle  
Amber: If you travel to Thais, you really should visit the marvellous castle there.  
Player: Magic  
Amber: Spells are only taught in the guildhalls of the mainland.  
Player: Weapon  
Amber: The best weapons on this isle are just toothpicks, compared with the weapons warriors of the mainland wield.  
Player: Monsters  
Amber: Oh, I fought orcs, cyclopses, minotaurs, even dragons, and many other creatures.  
Player: Orcs  
Amber: Not the nicest guys you can encounter. I had some clashes with them and finally ended up being their prisoner for a few months.  
Player: Cyclops  
Amber: I don't like the way they look at you. Their eye seems to pierce right through you. Creepy!  
Player: Minotaur  
Amber: They are nasty monsters, particularly as they have distance fighters and mages in their clans. My backpack is handmade from minotaur leather.  
Player: Dragon  
Amber: Their breath is so hot! I had to cut my hair after my last encounter with a dragon because the ends were all burnt. That's what you gotta deal with as a female adventurer!  
Player: Premium  
Amber: I wouldn't want to miss being a premium adventurer. Everything is so much easier!  
Player: Bank  
Amber: I have almost no money with me anyway, so no need to deposit any at the bank.  
Player: Orcish / prisoner  
Amber: I speak some Orcish words, not many though, just a few basics like 'yes' and 'no'.  
Amber: It's 'mok' in Orcish. I tell you more if you bring me some food.  
Amber: In Orcish that's 'burp'. I tell you more if you bring me some food.  
Player: Food  
Amber: My favourite dish is salmon. Oh please, bring me some.  
Player: Salmon  
Amber: Yeah! If you give me some salmon, I'll tell you another Orcish word. Okay?  
Amber: Ok, then I won't tell you another Orcish word.  
Amber: You don't have any salmon!  
Player: Tools  
Amber: The most important tools you need are a rope, a shovel and maybe a torch.  
Player: Rope  
Amber: One day I fell into a hole without having a rope. I was yelling for help for three whole days! Eventually a fisherman passed by and pulled me out with his own rope, lucky me.  
Player: Shovel  
Amber: Sometimes I have the strong urge to use it to knock someone out.  
Player: Torch  
Amber: You know, on mainland you will be able to cast magic spells which provide you with light. You won't really need torches anymore.  
Player: Weapon  
Amber: The best weapons on this isle are just toothpicks compared with the weapons warriors wield on the mainland.  
Player: Raft or mission or quest  
Amber: I left my raft at the south-eastern shore. I forgot my private notebook on it. If you could return it to me, I would be very grateful.  
Player: Notebook  
Amber: Do you bring me my notebook?  
Amber: Too bad.  
Amber: Mhm, whatever you have there, it is not my notebook.  
Player: Al Dee  
Amber: I don't have much to say about him. I think he sells tools.  
Player: Amber  
Amber: Did you know my name is also the name of a gem?  
Player: Billy  
Amber: He brought me some of his famous rat stew. I really didn't want to insult him, but I simply can't eat something like that. So I told him I'm a vegetarian and I only eat fish. <gulps>  
Player: Cipfried  
Amber: A gentle person. You should visit him if you have questions or need healing.  
Player: Dallheim  
Amber: An extraordinary warrior. He's the first and last line of defence of Rookgaard.  
Player: Dixi  
Amber: I don't really know her, but she seems to be a nice girl.  
Player: Hyacinth  
Amber: Hyacinth is a great healer. He lives somewhere hidden on this isle.  
Player: Lily  
Amber: Hm, I think I haven't met her yet.  
Player: Loui  
Amber: Never seen him around.  
Player: Norma  
Amber: She has changed a lot since I last saw her.  
Player: Obi  
Amber: He's a funny little man.  
Player: Paulie  
Amber: No, I didn't go to the bank yet.  
Player: Santiago  
Amber: He promised to repair my raft.  
Player: Seymour  
Amber: I think this poor guy was a bad choice as head of the academy.  
Player: The Oracle  
Amber: The oracle is said to show you your destiny once you are level 8.  
Player: Tom  
Amber: To me he seems a bit rude, but maybe that's just my impression.  
Player: Willie  
Amber: He's funny in his own way.  
Player: Zerbrus  
Amber: An extraordinary warrior. He's the first and last line of defence of Rookgaard.  
Player: Zirella  
Amber: She seriously asked me if she could have the remains of my raft as fire wood! Can you imagine that??  
Player: Bye  
Amber: See you later, Player.
