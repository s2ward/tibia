A Taffy Bunny: *scamper*
A Taffy Bunny: *sniff*
Player: hi
A Taffy Bunny: *The bunny briefly sits on its hind legs and sniffs, but then pays no further attention to you.*

A Taffy Bunny: *Surprisingly, this time the bunny doesn't just sniff, but talks to you.* You brought me a LOT of marzipan carrots, friend. Really nice of you. ...
A Taffy Bunny: Let me tell you a little secret in return: I know where a treasure is hidden. If you dig around the northern headlands of the island, you'll find it. Right up north, right by the water, yes?
