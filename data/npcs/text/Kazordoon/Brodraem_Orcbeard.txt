Player: hi
Brodraem Orcbeard: Welcome! What a tragedy! My business was doing well but now these unexpected incidents queered my pitch.
Player: name
Brodraem Orcbeard: My name is Brodraem Orcbeard.
Player: job
Brodraem Orcbeard: I am the grave digger of the recently opened Kazordoon crypt. This should be a place to keep a worthy memory to all deceased inhabitants of this town.
Player: business
Brodraem Orcbeard: Well, I have to make the coffins and sarcophagi my customers want. Their wishes can be very different and sometimes impossible.
Player: incidents
Brodraem Orcbeard: First I thought it would be enough to clean the sarcophagi more often. But then some of the floor tiles broke and some columns crumbled. ...
Brodraem Orcbeard: I had so much to do that I had to stop my business. You want me to hire you for investigating the crypt?
Player: no
Brodraem Orcbeard: It is your decision. Come back if you have changed your mind. Otherwise I have to find someone else. (idle)
Player: bye
Brodraem Orcbeard: Keep up your good work, Player.
Player: (vanish)
Brodraem Orcbeard: Take care!
