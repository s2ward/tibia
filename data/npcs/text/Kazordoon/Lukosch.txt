NPC: Lukosch  
Player: hi / hello  
Lukosch: Welcome, Dead Orc! Do you feel adventurous? Do you want a weekly ticket for the ore wagon system here? You can use it right here to get to the centre of Kazordoon!  
Player: beer  
Lukosch: Do you have one with you?  
Player: buy / sell  
Lukosch: I prefer giving you the ticket without all that shop nick-nack!  
Player: dwarf  
Lukosch: That's what I am and always will be.  
Player: ticket / ore wagon / ride / travel  
Lukosch: Your weekly ticket is still valid. Would be a waste of money to purchase a second one.  
Player: job / work  
Lukosch: I sell tickets for the ore wagon system. And I helped build it, of course.  
Player: kazordoon  
Lukosch: Yes, this is Kazordoon. Well observed!  
Player: name  
Lukosch: I am one of the Lukosch brothers. Don't ask me how I got this name or I might have to crush your bones.  
Player: bye / farewell  
Lukosch: Hope to see you again.
