NPC: Dukosch  
Player: hi / hello  
Dukosch: Welcome, Player! Do you feel adventurous? Do you want a weekly ticket for the ore wagon system here? You can use it right here to get to the centre of Kazordoon!  
Player: beer  
Dukosch: Do you have one with you?  
Player: buy / sell  
Dukosch: I prefer giving you the ticket without all that shop nick-nack!  
Player: dwarf  
Dukosch: That's what I am and always will be.  
Player: ticket / ore wagon / ride / travel  
Dukosch: Your weekly ticket is still valid. Would be a waste of money to purchase a second one.  
Player: job / work  
Dukosch: I sell tickets for the ore wagon system. And I helped build it, of course.  
Player: kazordoon  
Dukosch: Yes, this is Kazordoon. Well observed!  
Player: name  
Dukosch: I am one of the Lukosch brothers. Don't ask me how I got this name or I might have to crush your bones.  
Player: bye / farewell  
Dukosch: Hope to see you again.
