Player: hi
Gnomillion: Welcome to the gnomish bank, Simula! Here it's all about money.
Player: name
Gnomillion: I'm Gnomillion.
Player: job
Gnomillion: I'm the gnome responsible for this bank. I can change money for you and help you with your bank account.
Player: global warming
Gnomillion: Those below are heating up the earth. Probably to burn everything but themselves.
Player: those below
Gnomillion: The more we learn about them, the more it becomes clear how little we know.
Player: thais
Gnomillion: We have established a teleport outpost somewhere near the city, although not many gnomes use it at the moment to visit this strange city.
Player: surface
Gnomillion: For all I heard it has to be a place of incredible poverty! They say peole there are so poor, that they even are often out of doors!
Player: sky
Gnomillion: The sky is a somewhat frightening concept to us gnomes.
Player: crystal
Gnomillion: Ah you are amazed by our crystals, aren't you? Well, you have only seen a tiny fraction of what they are able to do.
Player: mushroom
Gnomillion: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.
Player: gnome
Gnomillion: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.
Player: dwarf
Gnomillion: Dwarfs have been our allies for quite a while now.
Player: bye
Gnomillion: Good bye.
