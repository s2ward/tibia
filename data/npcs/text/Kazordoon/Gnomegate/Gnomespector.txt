Player: hi
Gnomespector: Hello fearless recruit.
Player: job
Gnomespector: I'm the gnomish chief physician and responsible for examining our new recruits!
Player: name
Gnomespector: My name is Gnomespector. I'm the gnomish chief physician and responsible for examining our new recruits!
Player: recruit
Gnomespector: You have already been scanned with g-rays. Too many g-ray doses could be hazardous to ungnomish health. One recruit turned green and went on a rampage. Well he was an orc in the first place though.
Player: dwarf
Gnomespector: Dwarfs have been our allies for quite a while now.
Player: gnome
Gnomespector: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.
Player: mushroom
Gnomespector: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.
Player: global warming
Gnomespector: Those below are heating up the earth. Probably to burn everything but themselves.
Player: those below
Gnomespector: The more we learn about them, the more it becomes clear how little we know.
Player: crystal
Gnomespector: Ah you are amazed by our crystals, aren't you? Well, you have only seen a tiny fraction of what they are able to do.
Player: thais
Gnomespector: We have established a teleport outpost somewhere near the city, although not many gnomes use it at the moment to visit this strange city.
Player: surface
Gnomespector: For all I heard it has to be a place of incredible poverty! They say peole there are so poor, that they even are often out of doors!
Player: sky
Gnomespector: The sky is a somewhat frightening concept to us gnomes.
Player: apparatus
Gnomespector: Don't be afraid. It won't hurt! Just step in!
Player: bye
Gnomespector: Good bye and take care!
