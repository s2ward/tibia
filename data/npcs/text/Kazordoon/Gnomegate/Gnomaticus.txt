Player: gnome
Gnomaticus: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.
Player: mushroom
Gnomaticus: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.
Player: global warming
Gnomaticus: Those below are heating up the earth. Probably to burn everything but themselves.

Gnomaticus: The more we learn about them, the more it becomes clear how little we know.
Player: crystal
Gnomaticus: Ah you are amazed by our crystals, aren't you? Well, you have only seen a tiny fraction of what they are able to do.
Player: thais
Gnomaticus: We have established a teleport outpost somewhere near the city, although not many gnomes use it at the moment to visit this strange city.
Player: surface
Gnomaticus: For all I heard it has to be a place of incredible poverty! They say peole there are so poor, that they even are often out of doors!
Player: sky
Gnomaticus: The sky is a somewhat frightening concept to us gnomes.
