Gnomelvis: Dwarfs have been our allies for quite a while now.
Player: gnome
Gnomelvis: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.
Player: mushroom
Gnomelvis: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.
Player: global warming
Gnomelvis: Those below are heating up the earth. Probably to burn everything but themselves.
Player: those below
Gnomelvis: The more we learn about them, the more it becomes clear how little we know.
Player: crystal
Gnomelvis: Crystals are one of the most progressive things gnomish ingenuity has come up with. Even most gnomes don't fully understand how the usage of the crystals resonances and light breaking capabilities work. ...
Gnomelvis: For outsiders it must seem like magic.
Player: thais
Gnomelvis: We have established a teleport outpost somewhere near the city, although not many gnomes use it at the moment to visit this strange city.
Player: surface
Gnomelvis: For all I heard it has to be a place of incredible poverty! They say peole there are so poor, that they even are often out of doors!
Player: sky
Gnomelvis: The sky is a somewhat frightening concept to us gnomes.
Player: bye
Gnomelvis: Good bye and take care!
