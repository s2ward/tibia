Player: hi
Gnomewart: Oh! Hi there! I guess you are here for the endurance test!
Player: name / job
Gnomewart: I'm Gnomewart and I'm responsible for the endurance test!
Player: endurance
Gnomewart: You have passed the test. If you consider what huge feet you have to move it's quite impressive.
Player: yes [bug]
Gnomewart: Very well then, my name is Gnomewart and I'm responsible for the endurance test!
Player: dwarf
Gnomeward: Dwarfs have been our allies for quite a while now.
Player: gnome
Gnomeward: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.
Player: mushroom
Gnomeward: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.
Player: global warming
Gnomeward: Those below are heating up the earth. Probably to burn everything but themselves.
Player: those below
Gnomeward: The more we learn about them, the more it becomes clear how little we know.
Player: crystal
Gnomeward: Ah you are amazed by our crystals, aren't you? Well, you have only seen a tiny fraction of what they are able to do.
Player: thais
Gnomeward: We have established a teleport outpost somewhere near the city, although not many gnomes use it at the moment to visit this strange city.
Player: surface
Gnomeward: For all I heard it has to be a place of incredible poverty! They say peole there are so poor, that they even are often out of doors!
Player: sky
Gnomeward: The sky is a somewhat frightening concept to us gnomes.
Player: bye
Gnomewart: Good bye my friend!
