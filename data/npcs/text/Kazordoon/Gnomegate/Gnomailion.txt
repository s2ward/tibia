Gnomailion: Now this is probably a love letter.
Gnomailion: How shall a little gnome handle such big parcels.
Gnomailion: Has this parcel just sneezed?
Player: hi
Gnomailion: Hello and welcome to the gnomish post station, Simula. If you're here for a trade just ask me. I can also explain the mail system.
Player: job
Gnomailion: This is the gnomish post station. If you have questions about the mail system or the depots, just ask me.
Player: name
Gnomailion: My name is Gnomailion.
Player: offer
Gnomailion: I sell parcels and letters. Ask me for a trade if you're interested. I can also explain how the mail system works.
Player: here
Gnomailion: Well, you can always ask me for help if you need information.
Player: crystal
Gnomailion: Ah you are amazed by our crystals, aren't you? Well, you have only seen a tiny fraction of what they are able to do.
Player: mushroom
Gnomailion: In the last century mushrooms have become more and more important for producing raw materials and tools and less important for sustenance.
Player: dwarf
Gnomailion: Dwarfs have been our allies for quite a while now.
Player: gnomes
Gnomailion: We gnomes are masters of growing and working crystals and we also mastered the raising of a variety of mushrooms for different purposes.
Commander Stone: I admit they can be a bit irritating sometimes. Then again, aren't we all now and then? The gnomes have fought an isolated war for centuries all on their own. I can't blame them for having some problems with outsiders.
Player: thais
Gnomailion: We have established a teleport outpost somewhere near the city, although not many gnomes use it at the moment to visit this strange city.
Player: sky
Gnomailion: The sky is a somewhat frightening concept to us gnomes.
Player: those below
Gnomailion: The more we learn about them, the more it becomes clear how little we know.
Player: bye
Gnomailion: Bye, bye, Simula.
