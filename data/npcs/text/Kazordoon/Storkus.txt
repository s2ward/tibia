Player: hi
Storkus: Greetings, Simula! Good you're showing up.
Player: name
Storkus: My name is Storkus Dustmaker, son of Fire from the Savage Axes.
Player: job
Storkus: I used to be a carpenter, but that was ages ago. Now I'm a vampire hunter.
Player: vampire hunter
Storkus: Yeah, that's my profession. If ye' want to learn more about it, ye will have to get some field experience. Nothing I could tell ye' would prepare ye' for the real thing.
Player: julius
Storkus: Yeah, I know him. Ol' buddy of mine.
Player: poem
Storkus: I'm not in the mood to recite poems.
Player: inquisition
Storkus: As long as they're helpful, I'm not asking questions, ye' know?
Player: henricus
Storkus: He is the current head of the inquisition. The third or fourth I had to work with since I 'opened business' so to speak.
Player: showing up
Storkus: I guess you are here on a mission?
Player: mission
Storkus: Ye' finished your job here. I already told ye' about the master vampires and their tokens, eh? Bring those tokens to me.
Player: tokens
Storkus: Would ye' like to give me vampire tokens?
Player: yes
Storkus: To promote ye' to the first vampire hunter rank I need one token from ye' - which ye' don't have right now.
Player: tokens
Storkus: Would ye' like to give me vampire tokens?
Player: no
Storkus: Another time maybe.
Player: bye
Storkus: Good bye, Simula!
Storkus: Bye!
