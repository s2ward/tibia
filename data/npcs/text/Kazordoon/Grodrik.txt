NPC: Grodrik  
Player: hi  
Grodrik: Leave me in peace. I don't want to chat with humans. Got my own worries and problems.  
Player: beer  
Grodrik: One of the things you can't have enough of.  
Player: dating  
Grodrik: Do I look that desperate? Stop breathing my air.  
Player: dwarf  
Grodrik: Yes! To the honour and strength of the dwarfs! <lifts his mug of beer>  
Player: Eclesius  
Grodrik: I've never heard that name.  
Player: elf  
Grodrik: Yuck.  
Player: job  
Grodrik: I'm a smith - surprise. But dwarven smiths are so common that it's hard to find a good position nowadays.  
Player: kazordoon  
Grodrik: There aren't enough women here, if you ask me. Particularly, not enough of the kind who are interested in me.  
Player: love  
Grodrik: <sigh>  
Player: mission  
Grodrik: Huh? What do I look like, a babysitter? Find your own missions, I don't have one for you.  
Player: name  
Grodrik:: I'm Grodrik Hammertoe, son of Grimbul Hammertoe.  
Player: woman  
Grodrik: <sigh>  
Player: bye  
Grodrik: Yeah, bye.  
Special dialogue:  
Player: worries / problem  
Grodrik: <sigh> My current problem is that my beer is empty. Got a mug of beer for me?  
Player: no  
Grodrik: Spare me your do-gooding speech on 'beer is bad' yadayada or I'll get angry. Sometimes a man needs his beer.  
Note: It is possible to talk to Grodrik only when doing some missions during The Scatterbrained Sorcerer Quest. If you answer "yes" after the word "worries / problem" the conversation will go through the quest lines. You can read these lines for example here.
