Player: hi
Gnominimus: Oh hello. Nice to see some civilized person down here.
Player: job / mission
Gnominimus: I'm a explorer foremost!
Player: name
Gnominimus: I'm Gnominimus, the explorer.
Player: here
Gnominimus: I found this curious place while exploring - as I should, I'm xplorer after all.
Player: explorer
Gnominimus: I discovered this cave and this curious gong!
Player: gong
Gnominimus: I tried everything to make it work, but with whatever I hit it, it won't budge. I guess it needs a special kind of mallet.
Player: mallet
Gnominimus: Yes, since the gong is down here, the mallet might be somewhere hidden in those caves. Then again, some creature might have stolen it and carried it away.
Player: mallet
Gnominimus: Now let's see what you have here! Amazing, this looks like a part of a mallet. Sadly there are parts missing.
Player: mallet
Gnominimus: Marvelous! You have found all parts of the mallet! It only takes some gnomish ingenuity and mushroom glue to fix it. Shall I give it a try?
Player: yes
Gnominimus: Aaaand there it is! As good as new!
