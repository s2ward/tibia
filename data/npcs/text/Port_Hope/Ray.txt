Player: hi
Ray: Hello. How may I help you Player? Ask me for a trade if you want to buy something. I can also explain the mail system.
Player: name
Ray: My name is Ray.
Player: ray
Ray: Yes, that's me.
Player: job
Ray: I am responsible for this post office. If you have questions about the mail system or the depots, just ask me.
Player: offer
Ray: I sell parcels and letters. Ask me for a trade if you're interested. I can also explain how the mail system works.
Player: news
Ray: There are so many news that I cannot retell them all. Talk to the colonists and keep your ears open.
Player: time
Ray: Now it's 8:32 am.
Player: thais
Ray: All cities are covered by our mailing system.
Player: king / tibianus
Ray: The king lives far away in the lovely city of Thais, but even he can be reached by our mailing system.
Player: army
Ray: We got not the best men of the Thaian army to guard this colony. Given the number of difficulties this colony faces, this is quite a problem.
Player: jungle
Ray: The jungle is a dangerous place. Many got lost there and never returned.
Player: apes
Ray: They are a pest. A quite dangerous pest as far as I can tell.
Player: lizards
Ray: The lizards give me shivers. They are so alien, even more than the minotaurs or orcs we know from the surroundings of Thais.
Player: dworcs
Ray: Those bloodthirsty headhunters live in the south. I heard only horrible stories about them and I believe they are not exaggerated.
Player: ferumbras
Ray: I hope this colony is too remote and meaningless to him to care for a visit.
Player: excalibug
Ray: There are rumours about some hidden stone tablets mentioning that weapon. Adventurers claim to have seen those tablets in the ancient lizard city.
Player: bye
Ray: I hope to see you back soon, Player.
Player: (vanish)
Ray: I hope to see you back soon.
