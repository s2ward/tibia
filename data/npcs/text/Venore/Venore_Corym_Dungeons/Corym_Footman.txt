Corym Footman: This material can only be found in the stomaches of stonerefiners. These creatures eat common stones and process them to rare earth. Even scientists don't know how this works exactly. Otherwise they would have reconstructed the process in their labs.
Player: enormous
Corym Footman: The deeper you are in a tunnel the hotter it is. That is known, but here the temperature rises much faster.
