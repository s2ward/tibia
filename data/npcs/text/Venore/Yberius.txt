Player: hi  
Yberius: Welcome, young Player! If you are new in Tibia, ask me for help.  
Player: gods  
Yberius: They are the creators of Tibia and all life on it.  
Player: Tibia  
Yberius: It's the world of Tibia.  
Player: life  
Yberius: There are the plants, the citizens, and the monsters.  
Player: plants  
Yberius: Crunor, the god of plants and fertility, watches over all plants, small and big.  
Player: citizens  
Yberius: Just walk around and meet them. Chat and learn about them.  
Player: monsters  
Yberius: Even they have their part in the bigger scheme. Even if it eludes us mere mortals.  
Player: help  
Yberius: Earn some gold and upgrade your equipment.  
Player: gold / money  
Yberius: If you need money, you have to slay monsters and take their gold. Look for swamptrolls in the swamps. But be careful. They use poisoned weapons.  
Player: equipment  
Yberius: First you should buy a machete. You will need it in the swamps. And better don't explore without a shovel and a rope.  
Player: name  
Yberius: I am Brother Yberius.  
Player: time  
Yberius: Now, it is 8:01 pm. Ask Shiantis for a watch, if you need one.  
Player: king  
Yberius: The king resides in the far away city of Thais.  
Player: army  
Yberius: The royal army is here to protect us.  
Player: life  
Yberius: There are the plants, the citizens, and the monsters.  
Player: quest  
Yberius: Earn some gold and upgrade your equipment.  
Player: heal  
Yberius: You aren't looking that bad. Sorry, I can't help you. But if you are looking for additional protection you should go on the pilgrimage of ashes.  
Player: ashes  
Yberius: Whenever you receive a lethal wound your lifeforce is damaged. With every single of the five blessings you have this damage will be reduced.  
Player: blessing  
Yberius: There are five different blessings available in five sacred places. These blessings are: the spiritual shielding, the spark of the phoenix, the embrace of tibia, the fire of the suns and the wisdom of solitude.  
Player: monsters  
Yberius: Even they have their part in the bigger scheme. Even if it eludes us mere mortals.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Yberius: The gods only know what this spawn of darkness might be up to.  
Player: Excalibug  
Yberius: This blasphemous weapon has to be destroyed.  
Player: bye  
Yberius: May the gods bless you, Player!  
Player: hi  
Yberius: Welcome, young Player! If you are new in Tibia, ask me for help.  
Yberius: Remember: If you are heavily wounded or poisoned, I can heal you for free.
