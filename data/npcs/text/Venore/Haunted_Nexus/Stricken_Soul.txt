Player: Hi  
Stricken Soul: This place is... haunted... heed my warning... there are... ghooooooosts here...! Why are you giving me that... look? I am certain, there aaaaaaare ghosts here - I've seen them! Do you believe me?  
Player: Yes  
Stricken Soul: Yeeeees... you need to help meeeeeee. I want those ghosts gone... this is my home and I need it to teach my students. Will you take care of the... ghosts?  
Player: Yes  
Stricken Soul: Excellent... I hope they will haaaaaaunt my house no longer. What was your... naaaaaame again, tell me?  
Player: Nome do Player  
Stricken Soul: Ah yeeeeees, Player... I will remember you. Now, lessons are every day in the morning and once a week in the evening... ...  
Stricken Soul: Oh, you're not here for this, are you? So about the ghoooosts, yes. You seeeee, there are 3 secret passages here. ...  
Stricken Soul: Thiiiiis is no ordinary house... it is a nexus, a gateway to a once hidden cathedral. Sheltering a small and peaceful society of scholars and monks. Secluded from every distraction. ...  
Stricken Soul: I was one of them and ordered to hold contact to the outside woooorld. But then, something... happened. ...  
Stricken Soul: Outsiders managed to sneak in, infiltrate and influence the society... for the worse. Who knows for what ends. They chaaaaanged... ...  
Stricken Soul: Shortly after, contact was lost... the nexus broken and sealed, ghosts appeared... eeeeeeeverywhere. ...  
Stricken Soul: Find the three passages... one is right here in the cellars, one in the jungles of Tiquanda and one in the deserts of Darama. ...  
Stricken Soul: Restore their connection and open this nexus to access the buried cathedral and find the cause to this... eliminate all remainders there if you must, Player.  
Player: Name  
Stricken Soul: I am... I was... I... it was such a looooong time ago.  
Player: Job  
Stricken Soul: I... was... not a servant. Not a lord nor a knight. I was a... traveller. Yeeeees. A scholar! I hoarded knowledge... some I would advise or teach. But of thoooooose I have no memory.  
Player: Scholar  
Stricken Soul: Yes, I am... a scholar! I teach... my knowledge... I can take you in as another student... just need to remember... your naaaaaame...  
Player: Bye
