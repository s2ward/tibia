Player: Hi  
Adrenius: Hello, Player! What can I do for you?  
Player: Name  
Adrenius: My name is Adrenius.  
Player: Job  
Adrenius: I'm a priest of Fafnar.  
Player: Excalibug  
Adrenius: What's that? You start annoying me.  
Player: No  
Adrenius: Oh. So once again I am proved right.  
Player: Fight  
Adrenius: Leave me alone. I don't want to fight.  
Player: King  
Adrenius: Who needs a king? I don't.  
Player: Priestess  
Adrenius: I live a solitary life here to meditate and contemplate..  
Player: Secret  
Adrenius: Secrets ... What do you mean?  
Player: Sword  
Adrenius: Swords? Don't you have something else to do?  
Player: Treasure  
Adrenius: Treasures? What is a treasure for you?  
Player: Weapon  
Adrenius: Who needs weapons? I never had and i never will have weapons - what for?  
Player: Library  
Adrenius: I heard of the library, but I never was very interested in it.  
Player: Book  
Adrenius: Read books, it increases your intelligence and, furthermore, it's a great source of inspiration!  
Player: Ankrahmu]  
Adrenius: Fafnar may burn this city of evil. Its heretical inhabitants and their blasphemous leader are an insult to the gods. Beware! The day of reckoning is at hand!  
Player: Carlin  
Adrenius: Carlin? Don't you mean Thais?  
Player: Darashia  
Adrenius: Even after the death of this swindler Daraman, the descendants of his followers cling to his ignorant teachings.  
Player: Daraman  
Adrenius: The Daramian deserts are much more impressive than this one. Sadly the continent is run over by heretics of all sorts ...  
Adrenius: Darashia is inhabited by the misguided followers of the so-called prophet Daraman, and Ankrahmun is a melting pot of mad and undeath worshippers.  
Player: Desert  
Adrenius: Sand, sand and again sand. Sand all over. Yes, I'd say: it's truly a desert!  
Player: Tower  
Adrenius: The tower was built and inhabited by the great sage Jakundaf himself. It's a shame that it can be rented nowadays. People have no respect for the past!  
Player: Thais  
Adrenius: Yyyyess. Yes, it's the capital city of Tibia I think.  
Player: God  
Adrenius: Fafnar is the greatest among the gods.  
Player: Fafnar  
Adrenius: Fafnar is the stronger one of the two suns above our world.  
Player: Suon  
Adrenius: Suon is the misguided sibling of the great Fafnar. Suon's light turns pale compared to the brightness of Fafnar.  
Player: Door  
Adrenius: Who needs doors? Free your mind!  
Player: Time  
Adrenius: Time? What is time? A word? A thing? An object?  
Player: Offer  
Adrenius: I can offer you religion and mysticism.  
Player: Hi  
Adrenius: Hello, Player! What can I do for you?  
Player: Netlios  
Adrenius: That fool! His book is nothing but a hoax! At least I believe that. Or did you find an answer to my questions?  
Player: Qualquer palavra  
Adrenius: You can't even say 'yes' or 'no'. You are not worth talking to me!  
Player: Yes  
Adrenius: By the way, I'd like a donation for my temple. Are 500 gold pieces ok?  
Player: Yes  
Adrenius: Thank you very much. Now, name me the first person in alphabetical order, his age, his fate, and how long he was on his journeys!  
Player: Anaso, 41, attacked by mother-bear, 117 days  
Adrenius: Hmmm, maybe. What can you tell me about the second 'adventurer'?  
Player: Elaeus, 39, attacked by dragon, 100 days  
Adrenius: Yes, that might be true. What did you find out about the third man?  
Player: Gadinius, 42, stepped in fire, 83 days  
Adrenius: Correct again! Hmmmm... I doubt you know anything about the fourth person!  
Player: Heso, 40, attacked by troll, 66 days  
Adrenius: Yes! Really, how did you figure that out? I bet you don't know anything about the last adventurer!  
Player: Hestus, 38, drank poison, 134 days  
Adrenius: That's right! Why didn't I see it? It's obvious, Netlios was right, and his stories are great! Wait, I'll give you something!  
Player: Bye  
Adrenius: Good bye.
