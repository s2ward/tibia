Player: hi  
Para Norbert: Welcome adventurer! I'm sensing some very unusual distortions in the fabric of reality recently. They are caused by an inactive portal right beside me. ...  
Para Norbert: I found a way to activate it. Yet, to keep it open, I have to stay here, focusing on the portal. Thus I need you to go in there and uncover the true story behind those distortions. Can I count on you?  
Player: yes  
Para Norbert: Thank you very much. In order to pass the invisible portal over there, you have to visit three places that are closely linked to death and afterlife. Sound this knell at each of the sites to infuse your aura with the ghostly energies there. ...  
Para Norbert: The places you have to visit are: the cemetery east of Carlin, a sacrificial site beneath the Ghostlands and a skull-adorned altar underneath the Dark Cathedral. ...  
Para Norbert: You also have to drink a special potion to pass the portal. Find bone meal and grave flower extract and mix them together to brew this potion. Once you drank the potion you will be able to pass the portal.  
Player: afterlife  
Para Norbert: It is the world of the dead. Many sages believe, that it is located below the world of the living. Yet some think, it lies within another dimension so that terms like above or beneath are inappropriate to describe it. ...  
Para Norbert: There are some rumours that the descent to the Netherworld is difficult yet possible for those still living.  
Player: bone meal  
Para Norbert: I guess, it should be made from a skull. Yes, grinding a skull into fine dust will do.  
Player: grave flower extract  
Para Norbert: As the name implies, grave flowers grow on graves. Pick one and distil it to extract its essence.  
Player: portal  
Para Norbert: It is right beside me. I have found it by using my magic devices.
