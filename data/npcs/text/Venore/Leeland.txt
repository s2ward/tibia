Player: news  
Leeland: I would love to have the time to chat and exchange gossip, but sadly business always comes first, you know?  
Player: carlin  
Leeland: I was there some time ago. I exchanged ideas with some important people there and even could sell them something that furthered their cause.  
Player: king  
Leeland: Do I hear envy in your voice? Is this really what you want? To be ... king? Well, one never knows ... perhaps you find something royal in my warehouse.  
Player: ferumbras  
Leeland: Ah, Ferumbras. I remember selling him torches for his first adventure as if it was yesterday.
