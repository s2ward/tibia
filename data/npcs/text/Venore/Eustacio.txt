Player: hi  
Eustacio: Hello my friend. What a delight to see you, even on a busy day. You can check your status or ask me about the location of the ongoing raids.  
Player: name  
Eustacio: I am Eustacio. At your service.  
Player: time  
Eustacio: It's just the time to make a fortune.  
Player: job / busy  
Eustacio: I am an aspiring businessman, that thrives to climb the ladder of success in the Venorean society.  
Player: aspiring  
Eustacio: I will make my own fortune and walk my way from the bottom to the top, even if it might take some decades.  
Player: ladder  
Eustacio: As a newcomer to the Venorean trader union, it's my goal to rise in the ranks of the local traders and become a name to be reckoned with.  
Player: ranks  
Eustacio: To reach my lofty goal though, I need some accomplishments to attach to my name.  
Player: accomplishments  
Eustacio: Recently an opportunity has arisen. A new kind of pirates has shown up and is threatening our shipping routes.  
Player: opportunity  
Eustacio: Right now the other trade barons are still in denial, in fear to scare of potential investors.  
Player: denial  
Eustacio: That's were I can put my foot in the door by successfully fighting this new threat.  
Player: threat  
Eustacio: For all I know the new pirates are some Corym clans that banded together.  
Player: corym / pirats  
Eustacio: I do not know much about these Corym clans Pirats! ...  
Eustacio: All I know is that they are launching attacks on our cities and coasts and that they tossed together some ship wrecks to create a small armada of ships.  
Player: armada  
Eustacio: They seem to employ new powerful magic to dominate our ships in sea battles. I doubt a victory on the seas can be acquired.  
Player: victory  
Eustacio: We have to rout out their base and strike them there, disrupt their supply lines and coordination.  
Player: disrupt  
Eustacio: The first step in our fight is to disrupt their operations, in the hopes it causes enough ruckus amongst them, ...  
Eustacio: so my other agents might catch some vital new information about their hideouts and supply lines.  
Player: operations  
Eustacio: Reports came in about their attacks. Spies, small ships and one big ship with cannons. ...  
Eustacio: I'm not too sure what to make of it but we need to stop them nevertheless. It's a mission for you!  
Player: society  
Eustacio: Dealing with the trade barons can be like swimming in a pool of sharks from time to time.  
Player: sharks  
Eustacio: They are the sharks of our society. If they notice you bleeding, you are as good as finished. ...  
Eustacio: Business is always a difficult and dangerous field of expertise, especially in Venore. The trade barons are not too fond of competition.  
Player: status / points  
Eustacio: I might consider telling you my secrets if you gather 1500 points.  
Eustacio: My agents didn't see anything of use yet.  
Player: venore  
Eustacio: It's a beautiful town on the surface. But it is ruled by business and business is a constant war.  
Player: bye  
Eustacio: Good bye, Player.
