Player: hi  
Urkalio: Welcome to the pits of the Hard Rock Tavern, Player.  
Player: job  
Urkalio: I am responsible for the Hard Rock Pits Tavern.  
Player: name  
Urkalio: I am Urkalio.  
Player: time  
Urkalio: No clue, it's equally dark down here at any time.  
Player: king / Tibianus  
Urkalio: Down here everyone is king as far as where his weapons reach.  
Player: Tibia  
Urkalio: Sooner or later everyone comes here, so why bother to travel.  
Player: buy  
Urkalio: I sell food and drinks for the hungry and thirsty.  
Player: food  
Urkalio: I have cookies, bread, cheese, ham, and meat.  
Player: Excalibug  
Urkalio: I would love to see that weapon in a fight.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Urkalio: THAT would be some attraction down here.  
Player: Fighting Pits  
Urkalio: Choose your enemies with care.  
Player: Carlin  
Urkalio: I don't care about their 'independence war'.  
Player: Thais  
Urkalio: Such a boring city. I wonder why anyone would live there.  
Player: Asrak  
Urkalio: He's the best. To be the man, you'll have to beat the minotaur, so to say. Not that you could provoke him to a fight at all.  
Player: Maria  
Urkalio: She's kind of my boss.  
Player: bye  
Urkalio: Have a good fight, Player.  
Player: hi
