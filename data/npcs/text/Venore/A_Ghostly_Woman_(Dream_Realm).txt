Player: hi / hello  
A Ghostly Woman: I feel you. I hear your thoughts. You are ... alive ...  
Player: alive / job  
A Ghostly Woman: Once I was alive too. I was a member of the order of the nightmare knights. Now I am but a shadow who walks these cold halls.  
Player: Nightmare Knights  
A Ghostly Woman: We lost ... perhaps everything is lost. Perhaps there never will be any new knights of our order.  
Player: knights / order  
A Ghostly Woman: Only those who passed the tests of the dream challenge would be able to become nightmare knights.  
Player: tests  
A Ghostly Woman: These halls are only a decoy to distract the inattentive. The true way is hidden well.  
Player: true way  
A Ghostly Woman: There is a secret .. but no ... I can hardly remember ... and I can't tell you anyway ... But ... perhaps ... It is so cold here ... If you gave me some ordinary boots that might give me some warmth I would give you a hint.  
Player: boots  
A Ghostly Woman: Do you have a pair of boots for me?  
Player: yes  
A Ghostly Woman: Oh thank you. Perhaps this will give me some comfort. It is that cold since I am dead ... for so long ...  
A Ghostly Woman: All I can give you is a little hint though: Not me but only the lost heroes can show you the way; and though it's only a game, it might change what will happen.  
Player: boots  
A Ghostly Woman: Do you have a pair of boots for me?  
Player: no  
A Ghostly Woman: So cold ... so cold.  
Player: bye / farewell  
A Ghostly Woman: Alone ... so alone. So cold.
