Player: Hi  
Pyro Peter: Ah hello, hello - I hope you are familiar with the dangers of fire!  
Player: Fire  
Pyro Peter: We need to do something to protect Shadowthorn or it will be devoured by the flames. And this is no ordinary fire. The firestarters laid waste with all their wrath, all their hate. ...  
Pyro Peter: I am afraid no water of this world can stop it. We have to find another way.  
Player: Shadowthorn  
Pyro Peter: Right now... countless firestarters are waiting in their cells below Shadowthorn, waiting to strike again. To take revenge and see the elves burn.  
Player: Firestarters  
Pyro Peter: Guarded by three overseers, the firestarters are locked away beneath Shadowthorn. But they are thirsting for revenge. ...  
Pyro Peter: However, with all three guards alive and a whole garrison of elves around them, there will be no way out of their cold, damp prison.  
Player: Overseers  
Pyro Peter: Guarded by three overseers, the firestarters are locked away beneath Shadowthorn. But they are thirsting for revenge. ...  
Pyro Peter: However, with all three guards alive and a whole garrison of elves around them, there will be no way out of their cold, damp prison.  
Player: Revenge  
Pyro Peter: It started with the rise of the temple of the bog god. It appeared over night. There were no witnesses except the creatures of the bog. ...  
Pyro Peter: When the elves saw the monument the next day, they felt a strange and powerful presence. The elder god of the bog.  
Player: Bog God, God / Bog  
Pyro Peter: When the elder god rose in the bog outside of Shadowthorn, many fell for his mighty influence. ...  
Pyro Peter: His powers so vast, his might so inconceivable, some elves turned to and followed him the very moment they set foot on the temple ground.  
Player: Followed  
Pyro Peter: The followers of the bog were numerous after the bog god temple appeared. ...  
Pyro Peter: However, many outsiders and watchful people of Shadowthorn sensed that following this entity blindly was wrong. ...  
Pyro Peter: They stood against the followers and a conflict arose.  
Player: Conflict  
Pyro Peter: Not long after the incident in the bog, discrepancies between the followers and the resisting people escalated. In a short but devastating battle between both fanatic factions, the houses of the followers were kindled by the resistance. ...  
Pyro Peter: Eventually the followers got the firestarters under control and locked them away in underground prisons, leaving Shadowthorn an eerie place full of hostility.  
Player: Name  
Pyro Peter: The flames will... the... what? Ah I uhm, I'm Peter. A-and you are ...? Ah, nice to meet you Player.  
Player: Job  
Pyro Peter: Job? JOB? This is not a simple job, I'm here to WARN people, to HELP the citizens of Venore! They just won't listen to me...  
Player: Mission  
Pyro Peter: I'm on a mission, yes. A mission to help the people of Venore - the people of Tibia! We must be aware of what happens at Shadowthorn!  
Player: News  
Pyro Peter: FIRE!! All of Shadowthorn is in flames! ...  
Pyro Peter: With all their overseers dead and the legions of followers in the era severely diminished, the firestarters got away. The elves BURN!! But these are no ordinary fires!! ...  
Pyro Peter: The fires lit by the firestarters are fuelled by their hate, their intolerance and anger - only water from the bog can extinguish such mayhem. ...  
Pyro Peter: We must go there and fight the fire to redeem ourselves and save Venore from the ever devastating flames!  
Player: Venore  
Pyro Peter: I want to warn the people of Venore of the dangers of Shadowthorn but... but they won't listen. It seems they all just ignore me.  
Player: Bye  
Pyro Peter: Goodbye, goodbye.
