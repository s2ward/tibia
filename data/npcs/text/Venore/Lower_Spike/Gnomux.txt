Player: Hi  
Gnomux: Hi!  
Player: Job  
Gnomux: I'm responsible for resupplying foolish adventurers with equipment that they may have lost. If you're one of them, just ask me about a trade.  
Player: Trade  
Gnomux: Here you are.   
Player: Gnomes  
Gnomux: What could I say about gnomes that anyone would not know? I mean, we're interesting if not fascinating, after all.  
Player: Dwarf  
Gnomux: They are good soldiers, but they are inflexible and unmoving in their ways of thinking, like stone. That makes it a bit hard for us to negotiate with them, as we gnomes always come up with new ideas.  
Player: Humans  
Gnomux: You humans are quite funny. Not only because of how awkward you look with those ridiculous long limbs, but how you talk and behave, too.  
Player: Spike  
Gnomux: I came here as a crystal farmer and know the Spike all the way back to when it was a little baby crystal. I admit I feel a little fatherly pride in how big and healthy it has become. ... 
Player: Below  
Gnomux: I think that every setback we faced here was more or less directly the work of the unseen hand of those below. They know we are coming. And they are afraid!  
Player: alpha
Gnomux: Gnomebase Alpha is a busy place with many opportunities for gnomes and their allies. But I prefer the remoteness of the Spike, as I can mind my own business more easily here.
Player: Bye  
Gnomux: Good bye Player and take care.
