Player: hi  
Talesia: Salutation, Player! What brings you to Crunor's Finest Warehouse?  
Player: name  
Talesia: I am Talesia De'Mir, owner of Crunor's Finest Warehouse.  
Player: job  
Talesia: I am the owner of Crunor's Finest Warehouse of course.  
Player: time  
Talesia: It's 6:52 am right now.  
Player: Crunor  
Talesia: A god worthy of worship. At least he gives something useful back to the faithful.  
Player: Warehouse  
Talesia: My warehouse is only one of many. We merchants hold this city together and lead it to prosperity.  
Player: king / tibianus  
Talesia: We pay this man enough to live here undisturbed of major interventions.  
Player: army  
Talesia: At least they are useful, but we pay enough taxes to supply the entire Thaian army.  
Player: ferumbras  
Talesia: I hope he is aware that his enemies live elsewhere.  
Player: excalibug  
Talesia: I am content with my family sword meloncutter.  
Player: thais  
Talesia: I hope they live well from our taxes...  
Player: tibia  
Talesia: The world is a treasure chest for those of knowledge and skill.  
Player: carlin  
Talesia: They are a bit problematic as business partners, but their independence from Thais is... interesting.  
Player: news  
Talesia: Even bad news can be good news, if you play your cards well.  
Player: tax  
Talesia: Venore is the major tax payer in the whole realm. So we more than deserve the privileges the king granted us.  
Player: privileges  
Talesia: We are allowed to trade with anyone, Thaian subject or not, have no Thaian noble as governor, and own the exclusive gambling license.  
Player: gambling  
Talesia: I don't care much about it, though others profit greatly.  
Player: sell / trade  
Talesia: Talk about that with my underlings.  
Player: bye  
Talesia: Fare thee well, Player.
