Player: Hi  
Oldrak: Welcome Player! Rarely I can welcome visitors in these days.  
Player: Name  
Oldrak: My name is Oldrak.  
Player: Job / Visitors  
Oldrak: I guard this humble temple as a monument for the order of the nightmare knights.  
Player: Excalibug  
Oldrak: A weapon of myth and legend. It was lost in ancient times ... perhaps lost forever.  
Player: Tibia  
Oldrak: That's where we are. The world of Tibia.  
Player: Time  
Oldrak: Now, it is 00:00 am.  
Player: Undead / Unlife  
Oldrak: Beware the foul undead!  
Player: Gods  
Oldrak: They created Tibia and all life on it ... and unlife, too.  
Player: Nightmare Knights  
Oldrak: This ancient order was created by a circle of wise humans who were called 'the dreamers'. The order became extinct a long time ago.  
Player: Extinct  
Oldrak: Many perished in their battles against evil, some went mad, not able to stand their nightmares any longer. Others were seduced by the darkness.  
Player: Dreamers  
Oldrak: They learned the ancient art of dreamwalking from some elves they befriended.  
Player: Dreamwalking  
Oldrak: While the dreamwalkers of the elves experienced the brightest dreams of pleasure, the humans strangely had dreams of dark omen.  
Player: Dark Omen  
Oldrak: They dreamed of doom, destruction, talked to dead, tormented souls, and gained unwanted insight into the schemes of darkness.  
Player: Goshnar  
Oldrak: The greatest necromant who ever cursed our land with the steps of his feet. He was defeated by the nightmare knights.  
Player: Necromants Nectar  
Oldrak: It is rumoured to open the entrance to the pits of inferno, also called the nightmare pits. Even if I knew about this secret I wouldn't tell you.  
Player: Ruthless Seven  
Oldrak: The Ruthless Seven - Banor help me - have their domain deep under the Plains of Havoc. I don't even dare to speak out their names.  
Player: Hugo  
Oldrak: Ah, the bane of the Plains of Havoc, the hidden beast, the unbeatable foe. I live here for years and I am sure it's only a myth.  
Player: Myth  
Oldrak: There are many tales about the fearsome Hugo. It's said it is an abomination, accidentally created by Yenny the Gentle. It's halve demon, halve something else and people say it's still alive after dozens of years.  
Player: Yenny the Gentle  
Oldrak: Yenny, known as the Gentle, was one of most powerful magic wielders in ancient times and known throughout the world for her mercy and kindness.  
Player: Bye  
Oldrak: Good bye, Player!
