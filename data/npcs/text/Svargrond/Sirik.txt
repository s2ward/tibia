Player: hi
Sirik: LONG LIVE JARL SVEN, THE YOUNGER!
Player: how are you
Sirik: I am healthy and vigilant. Always ready to make some raiders one head smaller.
Player: name
Sirik: I AM A BARBARIAN! Names are of no concern during work!! If somebody is calling for help, I will come.
Player: job
Sirik: It's my duty to protect Svargrond and its citizens.
Player: news
Sirik: I am busy. Please ask the citizens for news.
Player: rumour
Sirik: I have no time to natter. Ask the citizens for rumours.
Player: mission / quest
Sirik: Iskan told me that he has trouble with one of his dogs. I think he could need some help.
Player: guard
Sirik: I am a guard and proud to be a barbarian.
Player: castle
Sirik: You mean Frost Manor? It is the guildhall on top of the cliff.
Player: graveyard
Sirik: The sea is our graveyard! Our last journey to Everspring.
Player: sewers
Sirik: We don't have sewers here in Svargrond. Some Carliners told me about that invention. Sounds expedient.
Player: rebellion
Sirik: Who is up for a rebellion? Surely no one here in Svargrond.
Player: resistance
Sirik: The raiders attack us regularly but with that strategical good position of the city it is easy to hold them off.
Player: scum
Sirik: We will get rid of all that raider scum.
Player: haunted / undead
Sirik: Some people say that Helheim is a haunted place because there is a rock that looks like a skull. Just a tale to scare kids if you ask me.
Player: demon
Sirik: We have tales about dark, evil creatures that can kill dozens of brave warriors in a blink of an eye. I'm glad that these are only tales.
Player: tales
Sirik: Once upon a time there was ..... WHO DO YOU THINK I AM! GO TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER FOR SUCH THINGS!! (idle)
Player: captain
Sirik: Let me think......where could a captain be??? Think twice before you ask me silly questions!!! (idle)
Player: barbara
Sirik: Is that a name?? Maybe it originates from 'barbarian'. I have to think about that... bye! (idle)
Player: noise
Sirik: You heard something?? ALARM, RAIDER ATTACK!! (idle)
Player: breasts / busty
Sirik: NOT ME! With that thick fur clothes we are wearing, it is not easy to see... er... female characteristics.
Player: green ferrets
Sirik: Never heard of it. Is this some kind of a tree?
Player: (swear)
Sirik: Take this!
Player: army
Sirik: Good idea, how many people do we need for an army? Maybe you can recruit a few hundreds of your friends? *GIGGLE*
Player: husky / dog
Sirik: The huskies here at Svargrond are allowed to roam as they like. ...
Sirik: If they irritate you, hit them and they will run away. But be careful not to kill them if you don't want to get in trouble.
Player: mammoth
Sirik: Great animals and very tasty.
Player: seals
Sirik: You find them all around the Ice Islands. These damn Venorians hunt them with no mercy. I heard that Siflind wanted to do something against that.
Player: penguin
Sirik: Weird animals. Half fish half bird. They are all around here.
Player: ice golem
Sirik: Let me tell you something. There are so many dangers around here that a wandering ice block couldn't scare me.
Player: frost giants
Sirik: Big, stupid, dangerous and they live on Tyrsung. Nothing more to say about them.
Player: chakoya
Sirik: These chakoyas are nasty little creatures. Not very dangerous for an ambitious fighter but still nasty.
Player: dragons
Sirik: A special kind of them lives on Okolnir, the frost dragons. They adapted well to the cold conditions here.
Player: geyser
Sirik: I heard about that phenomenon. It's a pity that you can only find them on Okolnir. As this is the home of the frost dragons, it would be suicide to go there.
Player: zora / baltim
Sirik: Never heard that name.
Player: nor
Sirik: Mhmmm, Nor? Nobody with that name lives here in Svargrond. Maybe he is one of the southerners that came here.
Player: hjaern

Sirik: She is the post office clerk. Follow the moaning and you will find her.
Player: robert
Sirik: HAA, he thinks his weapons are the best!! Too weak to hold a real barbarian axe! You find him near the arena.
Player: romir
Sirik: He is an old hermit who lives in a hut on the elevated plain north of Svargrond . He is some kind of male witch, you know what I mean? ...

Sirik: He knows magic and all that. Maybe he teaches his knowledge to others.
Player: raiders
Sirik: In fact they are also barbarians. The difference is that WE are civilised and THEY are not!
Player: elf
Sirik: Too weak to hold a real weapon and too soft for the climate here. I've never seen one.
Player: dwarf
Sirik: How can somebody of that size drink that much?? I met a dwarf once but my memory of this evening is a little bit clouded.
Player: svargrond
Sirik: Svargrond is the only city here. Do you want to know where to find a shop, a trainer for a profession or a guildhall?
Player: hrodmir
Sirik: This big, icy rock you're standing at right now. The raiders live in the middle and south of the big Formorgar glacier.
Player: formorgar
Sirik: There are valuable ores in the mines under the Formorgar glacier. But nobody who has ever tried to gather some has ever come back. I have no clue what's going on down there.
Player: ice shelf
Sirik: West of Svargrond is the Fimbul Ice Shelf, Nibelor and Grimlund are embedded in shelf ice, and in the north of Hrodmir are several small shelf ice fields.
Player: fimbul
Sirik: Fimbul Shelf is the name of the big shelf ice west of Svargrond. A good spot to go ice fishing.
Player: Grimlund
Sirik: Stay away from there! It's the home of the chakoyas.
Player: nibelor
Sirik: It's a sacred place for us! Our shamans live there. Ask Iskan if you want to go there.
Player: okolnir
Sirik: The third biggest island of all Ice Islands. Home of the frost dragons. Give me your money if you want to go there, you won't need it afterwards.
Player: tyrsung
Sirik: That is the big island east of Hrodmir. Venorian hunters settled there ..... or maybe they got eaten up by the frost giants.
Player: helheim
Sirik: A small island north east of Tyrsung. Nothing important there. Maybe one of the fishermen can bring you there if you like to go.
Player: camps
Sirik: The raider camps are south of Hrodmir. The tribe to the east lives in a glacier cave. They call their settlement Ragnir. ...
Sirik: The most southern camp is called Krimhorn and the raider caves to the west are called Bittermor.

Player: sven
Sirik: Sven the Younger is our jarl. At this time he should be at the tavern. Follow the main road to the west and at the furrier quarter turn south.
Player: city
Sirik: Svargrond is the only city here. Do you want to know where to find a shop, a trainer for a profession or a guildhall?
Player: guild / trainer
Sirik: The guild masters for paladins and knights are at the arena, the shamans on Nibelor surely can teach druids new things ...
Sirik: and Romir the old hermit who lives in a cave north of Svargrond may have some knowledge concerning magic.
Player: guildhall
Sirik: In the city you will find three guildhalls. Frost Manor is on top of the cliff ...
Sirik: Crystal Glance is north of the depot at the street which leads to the arena and Mammoth Belly is to the south, near the furrier quarter.
Player: queen
Sirik: Who?
Player: cult
Sirik: Let me think .......... Yes there have been a bunch of strange looking guys passing Svargrond and heading for the old mines. It somehow reminded me of a cult.
Player: mines
Sirik: There are valuable ores in the mines under the Formorgar glacier. But nobody who has ever tried to gather some has ever come back. I have no clue what's going on down there.
Player: everspring
Sirik: The happy hunting grounds are left for the afterlife. Ask the shamans if you want to know more about it.
Player: years of the serpents
Sirik: All of a sudden the years of the serpents ended. I am glad that we regained the contact with the rest of Tibia. ...
Sirik: Still, if you are very attentive, you may see a sea serpent. Not all of them have disappeared.
Player: uman / banor
Sirik: I only know Chyll, the cold north wind, the father of frost.
Player: ferumbras
Sirik: Wait, wait! Don't say a word, it's, it's ...
Sirik: that very small guy with the hairy feet? No?
Player: excalibug
Sirik: I would love to have that legendary weapon. If you find it, bring it to me!
Player: arena
Sirik: If you think you are strong enough, then try to fight there. You have to challenge waves of monsters that get stronger and stronger. ...
Sirik: The entrance to the arena is a stairway north of the town, left of the town gate.
Player: shops
Sirik: Near the harbour you find the equipment shop, the branch of the explorer's society as well as the post office and the bank. ...
Sirik: Right-hand of the depot, which is in the centre of Svargrond, you find the furniture store ...
Sirik: All weapon and armor traders linger at the arena in the North and the tavern is to the west.
Player: post / jewellery
Sirik: The post office is next to the jewellery store. It is on the main road near the harbour.
Player: tavern
Sirik: Follow the main road to the west and at the furrier quarter turn south. It is the big fur tent in the west. You can't miss it.

Player: druid
Sirik: You have to look for Hjaern.
Player: paladin
Sirik: You have to look for Hawkyr.
