Player: hi / hello  
A Restless Soul: Ahhhh! At last someone that can listen to my story!  
Player: story  
A Restless Soul: I was captured and tortured to death by the cultists here. They worship a being that they call Ghazbaran ...  
A Restless Soul: In his name they have claimed the mines and started to melt the ice to free an army of vile demons that have been frozen here for ages ...  
A Restless Soul: Their plan is to create a new demon army for their master to conquer the world. Hjaern and the other shamans must learn about it! Hurry before it's too late.
