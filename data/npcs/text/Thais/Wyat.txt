Player: Hi  
Wyat: Salutations, Player! Speak quick, my time is limited.  
Player: Time/Sheriff  
Wyat: I uphold law and order. I protect Thais inhabitants ... and keep an eye on them.  
Player: Inhabitants  
Wyat: Be more specific! If you want to talk about someone I'll need a name!  
Player: Sam/Weapon/Armor  
Wyat: Sam, the Thaian smith, is a man of great diligence. Whenever in need of weapons or armor, just ask him.

Player: News  
Wyat: I have no news for the public.  
Player: Elane  
Wyat: A woman of great skill and courage. No one deserves the title of a Grandmaster of the Paladins more then her.  
Player: Benjamin

Wyat: Luckily that's nothing I have to care about.  
Player: Criminal  
Wyat: Our enemies are numerous and not all are obvious.  
Player: Castle  
Wyat: The castle should be relatively safe from criminal transgressions.  
Player: City  
Wyat: The city is not as bad as some people might claim, but we certainly have our problems here.
