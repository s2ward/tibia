Player: Hi  
Noozer: Hm? Oh! Oh, yes a... visitor! Intruder? Benefactor...? Wha- what are you? If you want to pass through this cave, I may have to disappoint you. Or maybe not. It... depends. So, just passing through?.  
Player: pass  
Noozer: Yes, yes. Or wait - why do you want to.. ah what does it matter. So you want to get through these caves, fine. But be warned! ...  
Noozer: ...wait a second, I lost it. What was I going to say again? Ah yes - DANGEROUS! These. Caves. Are. Dangerous. No way you get out alive. Ever. Again. ...  
Noozer: Also you should not disturb those... people down there. Yeah. They... hm, wait, they - who are they again? Hey! Who are you? Are you talking to me?! Ah, ah... oh yes, I remember. ...  
Noozer: Wait - I am the guardian here, yes! The keeper of... something... or another, yes, I... guard this place. With my life. Don't I? Of course! ...  
Noozer: Is, er... this the moment where I should try to... stop you? Yes? No? Ah, you know what - you go down there, those guys are angry as dung anyway. Try your luck, return to me when you're done. If you still can. Or not.  
Player: job  
Noozer: Then don't waste my time. I'm doing some important... business... here. Actually... where am I? If I find out, I will be even more angry than I am now. Out of my sight.  
Player: cave  
Noozer: I was stationed in this cave to... guard something. Right now I am not even sure what that was.  
Player: mission  
Noozer: I was on a mission, too - I guess. It was all quite blurry back then. Maybe I'll leave this place after I recovered completely. I have to find out what happened to me.
