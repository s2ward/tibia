Player: hi / hello  
Eclesius: Dear Player, how good to see you again! If you're here for your tasks, go right ahead.  
Player: Assistant  
Eclesius: As my assistant you can carry out daily tasks and solve missions for me.  
Player: Eclesius  
Eclesius: Yes?  
Player: First Dragon  
Eclesius: He was bested in combat, but the hero who killed him, was that humble that he never claimed the fame.  
Player: Job  
Eclesius: I have a lot of work to do. I'm a very wise sorcerer, you see. So I'm busy creating magic fields, inventing new spells, reading books, summoning creatures... all very complex. That's why I need assistants for the easy work.  
Player: Key  
Eclesius: Where did I put that key, erm... I think it's somewhere in my lab. But then again my memory is not the best.  
Player: Mission / Quest  
Eclesius: I think all important missions are solved. At least I can't remember anything else right now. But you can still do some tasks for me.  
Player: Name  
Eclesius: My name is Eclesius. And I'm quite happy that my memory works almost all of the time.  
Player: Sorry  
Eclesius: Yes, you SHOULD be sorry!  
Player: Thais  
Eclesius: I moved away from there for a reason. I just can't remember what the reason was.  
Player: Turian / Frog  
Eclesius: Oh dear. It's all my fault that he is the way he is now. That much I can remember. <sniff>  
Player: Venore  
Eclesius: It's to the far east of here. You can either reach it by ship or walk there, but it's QUITE a walk. I think.  
Player: bye  
Eclesius: Oh, have you already finished your tasks? Then, uh, have a pleasant day! Don't forget to drop by tomorrow!  
Player: Task  
Eclesius: I have five tasks which, ideally, need to be done once a day. Sweep the house, polish my crystal ball, feed my fish, exterminate bats and prevent the apocalypse. ...  
Eclesius: ... wow, I remembered them all. Now if you remember to do them and I remember to pay you for it, I think we'll all be very happy! ...  
Eclesius: Just remind me of the task you wanted to do and go right ahead, uh... what's your name again?  
Player: Player  
Eclesius: Was that your name...? Player? Really? <scratches head> Fine then... hello Player!

Player: Task  
Eclesius: I have five tasks which, ideally, need to be done once a day. Sweep the house, polish my crystal ball, feed my fish, `nate bats and prevent the apocalypse. ...  
Eclesius: ... wow, I remembered them all. Now if you remember to do them and I remember to pay you for it, I think we'll all be very happy! ...  
Eclesius: Just remind me of the task you wanted to do and go right ahead, uh... what's your name again?  
Player: Feed  
Eclesius: Feed? Feed who? My fish? Oh yes. But when I looked at it earlier, it seemed as hungry as ever! What is taking you so long?! Go and feed it!  
Player: Feed  
Eclesius: Feed my fish? Oh, right. <scratches head> So... have you fed it?  
Player: yes  
Eclesius: But the fish doesn't speak at all! I'm sure you must've done something wrong when feeding it. Please try again.  
Player: Sweep  
Eclesius: I told you to sweep the house? Really? Well, you seem to have taken such a long time that everything is dirty again. I guess you should start over.  
Player: Sweep  
Eclesius: Well, what are you waiting for? Sweep all the furniture in the house! Or are you done already?  
Player: yes  
Eclesius: No, no, no - achoo! I can still smell the dust in the ai.. - achoo! - air. Take that broom and clean every piece of furniture in my living room and bedroom!  
Player: sweep  
Eclesius: Well, what are you waiting for? Sweep all the furniture in the house! Or are you done already?  
Player: no  
Eclesius: Well, then off to work! Go on, get on with you!  
Player: Prevent  
Eclesius: What's wrong? Are you afraid to go down there? There's absolutely no reason for that. Me? Erm... my knees, you know. Stairs are such a trial for me. Go on! Secure the cage and calm the demon!  
Player: Exterminate  
Eclesius: You're still not done with the bats, I can hear them flapping and flapping and flapping! Argh! Do something!  
Player: Polish  
Eclesius: Yes! I remember! You were supposed to polish my crystal ball, weren't you? But when I took a look at it earlier, it was still clouded. You'd better start right away!  
Player: Polish  
Eclesius: Yes! I remember! You were supposed to polish my crystal ball, weren't you? Have you done it yet?  
Player: yes  
Eclesius: No no no! Whatever you did to it, it had nothing to do with polishing! I can't even see my face in it, let alone the future. I hope you can do better than that.  
Player: Polish  
Eclesius: Yes! I remember! You were supposed to polish my crystal ball, weren't you? Have you done it yet?  
Player: no  
Eclesius: Well then, what are you waiting for? Go away and get on with whatever it was you were doing!  
Player: Exterminate (after killing the cat)  
Eclesius: Don't even THINK that I'll let you into my attic again, you cat killer! And don't count on me forgetting about that incident!  
Player: Exterminate  
Eclesius: The bats? They have been quiet for a while now. Were you able to kill a few of the pests?  
Player: yes  
Eclesius: No! I can still hear them! Kill more of them, I can't concentrate!  
Player: exterminate  
Eclesius: The bats? They have been quiet for a while now. Were you able to kill a few of the pests?  
Player: no  
Eclesius: Well then get on with it! I'm suffering here!  
Eclesius: Prevent  
Eclesius: What's wrong? Are you afraid to go down there? There's absolutely no reason for that. Me? Erm... my knees, you know. Stairs are such a trial for me. Go on! Secure the cage and calm the demon!  
Player: Prevent  
Eclesius: Did you prevent the apocalypse, my brave assistant?  
Player: Yes  
Eclesius: You haven't! You must've forgotten something important. Go back down there and finish the task, or we might not see another tomorrow! If you need magical oil, don't hesitate to come to me with the ingredients.  
Player: Prevent  
Eclesius: Did you prevent the apocalypse, my brave assistant?  
Player: No  
Eclesius: What are you waiting for?! It might only be a matter of minutes before the demon breaks free! Hurry up! If you need magical oil, don't hesitate to come to me with the ingredients.

Eclesius: Most curious.  
Player: hi  
Eclesius: Oh. OH. Is that... the result...?  
Player: bye  
Eclesius: What do you mean, 'bye'?? You stay here and finish that mission! Your only excuse to leave would be if you have to go pee!  
Player: pee  
Eclesius: Argh! Not now! But... okay, I don't want my floor dirtied. But once I beam you up, you'll have to start over with the levers! Still want to go?  
Player: mission  
Eclesius: Wait, wait, I know you. I also know what you wanted from me. Errrm... ah yes! The milk delivery! Right?  
Player: yes  
Eclesius: Well, where is it?? And what did Arthur say?
