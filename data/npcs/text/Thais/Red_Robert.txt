Player: hi  
Red Robert: We both know you're here to fight hordes of monsters, so let's get to it. Just tell me if you're ready to fight or if you need me to explain something.  
Player: explain  
Red Robert: I can give you details about how waves in the monster arena work and explain how to initiate a fight. I can also give you information on prizes and fees.  
Player: waves  
Red Robert: First thing to know: dying here will not cost you anything, except the fee you need to pay for each match. You will keep all your experience, skills and loot. ...  
Red Robert: After a fight has been initiated by giving me the necessary details, a timer will be started. ...  
Red Robert: If you can survive all waves of monsters, you may receive a prize and earn a place in the hall of fame. ...  
Red Robert: The fight will be cancelled if the predetermined number of players for a fight does not show up in the anteroom. ...  
Red Robert: If a wave is in progress but players take too long and cannot finish all monsters within the time limit, the fight will be cancelled as well.  
Player: initiate  
Red Robert: Every premium player can participate in the monster arena. To initiate the first wave, just talk to me and tell me if you want to play. ...  
Red Robert: If the arena is not occupied, you will then be able to tell me how many players will take part. You can also create solo matches.  
Player: prizes  
Red Robert: Surviving a full battle over 10 waves will grant you a reward based on the difficulty level you have selected. Please talk to my assistant right next to the arena entrance for more information on how to claim your reward.  
Player: fees  
Red Robert: Initiating a fight against monsters in the arena will require an entrance fee of 1000 gold. Please make sure to have enough money on your bank account before setting up a fight.  
Player: job  
Red Robert: Staying here most of the time, waiting for new arrivals, counting bodies and occasionally I get into the action myself - when nobody's looking.  
Player: name  
Red Robert: Robert. You can call me Red Robert. Nice to meet you.  
Player: fight  
Red Robert: Good, let's do battle. Remember that you can cancel a setup any time. Are you ready to assemble your team?  
Player: bye  
Red Robert: Good fight, good night.
