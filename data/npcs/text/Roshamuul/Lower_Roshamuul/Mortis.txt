Player: hi  
Mortis: Yes yes, hello there. Praise and all.  
Player: inquisition  
Mortis: We all have our reasons to fight. The gods, justice, revenge or just to do the right thing. Regardless what the reasons are, the enemies are all the same: heretics, cultists and servants of the lords of evil.  
Player: henricus  
Mortis: He is competent, pious and to the point. Just the man we need in dire times like this.  
Player: isle  
Mortis: Look around you, it's a fiendish wasteland. There's nothing to it. And I am repairing the very pathway that will lead even deeper into its tainted heart. ...  
Mortis: Yet, if it is of use to the inqusition, I will not complain. There IS a demonic presence here that needs to be purged after all.  
Player: demonic  
Mortis: There are vile creatures roaming these lands. We are currently under attack from all sorts of critters while working on this bridge. ...  
Mortis: I believe Sandomo has named them 'Frazzlemaw'. They seem to feast not only on us but on everything we add to the bridge! ...  
Mortis: Mortar? A sweet treat to them. Stone and bricks? One giant bite. Wooden planks? Gone in an instant. ...  
Mortis: I, however, need mortar to maintain this bridge. If we want to sustain this giant traverse, the only way is by using stone, chalk and gravel.  
Player: bridge  
Mortis: There are vile creatures roaming these lands. We are currently under attack from all sorts of critters while working on this bridge. ...  
Mortis: I believe Sandomo has named them 'Frazzlemaw'. They seem to feast not only on us but on everything we add to the bridge! ...  
Player: mortar, chalk / gravel  
Mortis: Mortar consists of chalk and gravel. Mix those ingredients with water and you will get a fine building material. ...  
Mortis: There are enough stones for me around here, but I also need mortar to repair the bridge. If Sandomo says I shall repair this bridge, I shall. But I cannot fight these fiends and do repair work at the same time. ...  
Mortis: Well, now you know my dilemma, feel free to help me out. Mix some mortar and fill it into these troughs. Oh and... Sandomo will pay you, I guess.  
Player: troughs  
Mortis: Once you have mixed mortar by adding water to a bucket of gravel and chalk, fill the mix into one of the troughs over there.  
Player: bucket  
Mortis: You will need a bucket to fill the water, gravel or chalk into. You can get one down at the outpost from brother Maun.  
Player: pay  
Mortis: I know we brothers all do this for the inquisition, the gods and all that but... I know this is dangerous work. Talk to Sandomo and I am sure he can offer some kind of reward.  
Player: gods  
Mortis: The gods of good are our light in the darkness. We owe them to fight this battle.  
Player: dream  
Mortis: This is a bizarre place and dreams are almost like living things here.  
Player: bye  
Mortis: Goodbye.
