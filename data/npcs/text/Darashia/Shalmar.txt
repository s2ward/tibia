Player: hi
Shalmar: Daraman's blessings, Simula. If you'd like to learn sorcerer or druid spells, let me know.
Player: name
Shalmar: I am Shalmar Ibn Djinbar, the caliph's magician and astrologer.
Player: job
Shalmar: I teach magic spells to the worthy.
Player: time
Shalmar: It's 5:20 am right now.
Player: offers
Shalmar: I'm teaching spells to sorcerers and druids. I also used to sell magic goods, but my assistant Asima in the next room does that for me now.
Player: rune
Shalmar: I don't sell this anymore, it sort of kept on confusing me to do that much work. Please talk to my assistant Asima in the next room to purchase magic goods.
Player: caliph
Shalmar: The caliph has the strong soul needed to guide his people.
Player: ferumbras
Shalmar: His weakness is evident by the rotting of his soul.
Player: excalibug
Shalmar: A strong mind and a pure soul has no need for such items.
Player: thais
Shalmar: It's a city of souls who failed to see the need of ascension.
Player: tibia
Shalmar: The world is filled with wonderous places and items.
Player: carlin
Shalmar: I heard it's a city of druids.
Player: ascension
Shalmar: Talk to Kasmir about that issue. It's not my place to pose as a teacher since I am a student, too.
Player: news / rumor / rumour
Shalmar: News are distractions. Nothing of importance happens outside your own soul.
Player: sorcerer / druid
Shalmar: The way of the magician is not that different from the way to ascension.
Player: bye
Shalmar: Daraman's blessings.
