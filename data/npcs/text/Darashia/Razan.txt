Player: hi
Razan: Greetings Simula. What leads you to me? Looking for paladin or knight spells, perhaps?
Player: name
Razan: Razan ... Razan Ibn Rublai.
Player: job
Razan: I am the weaponmaster of Caliph Kazzan the great.
Player: time
Razan: You are talking of what you are wasting right now?
Player: caliph
Razan: We owe Caliph Kazzan our loyality and gratitude, thrice praised be his name.
Player: shalmar
Razan: He is competent. That's fine enough for a mage.
Player: djinn
Razan: Some people in Darashia rely to much on the services of these creatures. I wonder if they keep the path in mind.
Player: path
Razan: The path of enlightenment, leading to ascension as taught to us by Daraman.
Player: Daraman
Razan: Better talk to Kasmir about that.
Player: ferumbras
Razan: Maybe a worthy opponent, but probably only another of these spellcasting cowards.

Razan: The skill should make a fighter strong, not the weapon.
Player: army / guards

Razan: You will find him in the Muhayin, the sacred tower of meditation.
Player: news
Razan: I don't care for rumours but for facts.
Player: weaponmaster
Razan: I mastered the arts of close combat and distance fight alike. I teach both paladins and knights in their ways.
Player: tibia
Razan: The world is a dangerous place for body and for soul.
Player: knight
Razan: The way of the warrior is not that different from the way to ascension.
Player: spellbook

Razan: Sorry, I don't teach spells for your vocation.
