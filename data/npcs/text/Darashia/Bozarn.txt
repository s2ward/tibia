Player: hi  
Bozarn: Greetings. The master is waiting for you in the basement.  
Player: job  
Bozarn: I'm a manservant, like my father and my grandfather before me.  
Player: master  
Bozarn: My master is a noble and wise man. He dedicated his life and fortune to the pursuit of knowledge. ...  
Bozarn: He became a scholar of note at a young age, and in our days he is often consulted amongst his peers for his vast knowledge of diverse topics.  
Player: scholar  
Bozarn: I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on my master's studies, but he certainly is well known for them to men of learning from all over the world.  
Player: manservant  
Bozarn: In modern days our responsibilities are numerous.  
Player: modern  
Bozarn: Times have changed, and the nobility and the rich usually don't employ large staffs of people any more. Only the most important ones are kept and entrusted with more and more duties.  
Player: nobility  
Bozarn: Only the most civilized realms have a nobility worthy of that name. I doubt that any of the non-human races even grasp the concept of nobility, which might explain their barbarism.  
Player: rich  
Bozarn: There is a new breed of nobility. Sophisticated men and women, who, through determination and intelligence, rise to a status that allows them to be recognised by the true nobility as almost, but not quite, equals.  
Player: Ferumbras  
Bozarn: Who hasn't heard about that madman. A threat to society and civilisation indeed! The master is more familiar with this topic, though.  
Player: Ruthless Seven  
Bozarn: Pardon me, but I'm afraid I'm not familiar with those bands the Thaian youths listen to.  
Player: bye  
Bozarn: Good bye!
