Player: Hi  
Domizian: Greetings, traveller!  
Player: Name  
Domizian: I am Domizian.  
Player: Job  
Domizian: You might deem me a sage and a scholar.  
Player: Daniel  
Domizian: He is the governor of Edron and grandmaster of the Knights of Banor's Blood. I made his acquaintance some years ago, when he was visiting Darashia.  
Player: Leader  
Domizian: In case you talk about the werehyaena alpha leader: Her name is Rhargu. She lives deep down in the werehyaena lairs together with her pack.  
Player: Rhargu  
Domizian: She's a werehyaena. The leader of the pack that causes so much trouble around Darashia.  
Player: Trade  
Domizian: Of course, let me see what you have.  
Player: Curse / Were / Mission  
Domizian: So, Daniel Steelsoul sent you? He is a most respectable man and I'm honoured to know him. It is of advantage that you have already dealt with the were-sickness so you won't hurl yourself into this adventure unprepared. ...  
Domizian: Listen, the curse has indeed spread to the Darama Desert - but not recently. It exists here since a long time but only few know about it. Here, it's not werewolves or werebears. The danger that plagues this region are the werehyaenas. ...  
Domizian: Until now they were savage and smelly beasts who hunted down a travelling merchant now and then. But mostly they stayed in their subterranean lairs and lived off carrion. ...  
Domizian: But a few weeks ago something changed. Suddenly they had shamans, something I never saw before. Those shamans are using bone talismans and paint their fur with runes. Runes I saw just once before ... on an artefact from Drefia. ...  
Domizian: I'm afraid the werehyaenas have a kind of pact with the undead of Drefia but I don't have proof. Please go to their lairs and investigate. You will find the entrance north of the town, at a large standing stone. ...  
Domizian: Be careful down there, though! Werehyaenas might not be the only danger you will have to face. I heard strange stories about blood pools, a talking skull and even liches.  
Player: Mission  
Domizian: So, the werehyaenas are indeed working together with Drefia's undead. That's very dangerous, to say the least. Please, if you can, find a way to stop this.  
Player: Destroy / Shrine  
Domizian: I guess you need something holy or at least blessed to destroy this evil site. The werelions know a ritual that allows you to bless fire in general. It should work with this torch, too. ...  
Domizian: But you can do that only at a special altar in our sanctum. Go to the Lion's Rock in the north-west of Darashia. Descend to the area where the most noble lions are guarding a secret entrance. ...  
Domizian: There is a door, you can only open if you know the right phrase. It is: 'The sun guides our hearts. The moon guards our dreams'. Down there you will find a room with a mosaic, showing a sun and a moon. ...  
Domizian: There is an altar where you can bless the torch. You have to find a lion mane flower and chop the petals up small. Then sprinkle the chopped petals into the flame while standing at the altar. ...  
Domizian: Thus, the fire will be blessed and should be able to burn down the evil bone shrine.  
Player: Mission  
Domizian: You destroyed the pact between the werehyaenas and the undead! You did Darashia a great favour, that's for sure. But there are still so many of them, they could be a real threat to the caravans that try to reach the city. ...  
Domizian: Please, kill three hundred of those ferocious werehyaenas and their shamans.  
Player: Kill / Mission  
Domizian: Yes, there are less of them now! What a relief for Darashia. Well, I guess, now I can trust you enough to tell you a little secret about myself. I'm actually a werelion. Don't be scared, though. ...  
Domizian: There's something special to the werelions: We can control the curse and don't attack people like mindless beasts. This is the reason why I can live here in the city and talk to you in such a civilized way. ...  
Domizian: Well, the werehyaenas were a danger to Darashia but they also caused a very personal problem for me. Look, I assumed that they are up to something and that this something could be the undead in Drefia. ...  
Domizian: I warned our king, Heliodor, about it but he didn't believe me. I insisted and got short-tempered - which is never a good idea in the presence of your king. He exiled me as punishment for my impudence. ...  
Domizian: This is the reason why I live here in Darashia. This city has its conveniences but I would like to return to my pride. Please find Heliodor and tell him about the werehyaenas' pact with the undead. ...  
Domizian: Take this ring, it will allow you to enter the lower part of the sanctum. Wear it while you touch one of the lion columns in the centre of the sanctum's upper floor. Then you will reach the lower part.  
Player: Special  
Domizian: The werelions are special among the therianthropes. We are not weak-willed victims of the curse. We control it. That means we can change form at will and are not feral beasts as soon as the full moon rises.  
Player: Therianthropes  
Domizian: Therianthropy is the ability of human beings to metamorphose into other animals. The most well known form of therianthropy is found in stories concerning werewolves. ...  
Domizian: But there are many others, too, like bears, hyaenas or lions.  
Player: Mission  
Domizian: You found Heliodor and told him about the werehyaenas? He will consider to pardon me? I don't know how I could thank you! Take this as a small compensation for your efforts!  
Player: Curse/ King / Sanctum  
Domizian: My king will consider to pardon me! Thank you again!  
Player: Bye  
Domizian: Farewell.
