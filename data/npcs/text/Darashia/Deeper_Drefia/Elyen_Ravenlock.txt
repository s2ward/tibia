Player: hi / hello  
Elyen Ravenlock: Hello, brother. What is it now?  
Player: blood  
Elyen Ravenlock: The dark well inside our fleshly hull. It sings to us, and to the Dark Lord.  
Player: blood priest  
Elyen Ravenlock: They are drawn to blood like a wasp is to honey. They have a ...special interest in it, I presume.  
Player: poison  
Elyen Ravenlock: For yourself or someone else? Give the details to our apothecaries upstairs, they will settle the price, too.  
Player: drefia  
Elyen Ravenlock: The dark flower. Our chants are its perfume, our dances its colour.  
Player: garden / night  
Elyen Ravenlock: The Gardens Of Night surround our sacred temples, east of the Necromancer Halls. Dark and light mix there, as do our chants.  
Player: job  
Elyen Ravenlock: I prefer to call it my calling. I am the Mistress of the Dark Chants in Drefia.

Elyen Ravenlock: I serve the Dark Lord. As do you, but you do not know it yet.  
Player: rats  
Elyen Ravenlock: Urgith's chosen. They run through our halls, free and unhindered. Do not harm them.  
Player: ritual  
Elyen Ravenlock: You could assist, I assume.

Elyen Ravenlock: Yes.
