Player: hi  
Samir: Hmm. Good day, Player. What do you want from an old man?  
Player: want / job  
Samir: I don't have a job anymore. Long time ago, I used to be an assassin... but that is a dark chapter of my past. Nowadays I'm a simple hermit.  
Player: assassin  
Samir: It is true - I once made a living from... well, putting people away who made others feel uncomfortable. It is not an easy life.  
Player: hermit  
Samir: That is the life I chose now. My sins can't be made undone, but my life in solitude is my self-imposed punishment.  
Player: life  
Samir: You would not want to lead such a life, believe me. And I simply refuse to take anyone as my apprentice anymore.  
Player: apprentice  
Samir: No way. I am old and weary. If you really want to throw your life away and become an assassin, go bother Atrad, Vescu or Erayo and try not to get killed.  
Player: Atrad  
Samir: You got Atrad's katana? Impressive. That probably wasn't an easy task. Don't hurt yourself with it, kid.  
Player: Vescu  
Samir: Interesting. So you managed to talk an assassin outfit out of Vescu? Doesn't surprise me... that fool is easily manipulated.  
Player: Erayo  
Samir: You were able to sneak into Erayo's house? Hehe, that must have startled him. <chuckles>  
Player: name  
Samir: I never speak my name in front of others. I believe that doing so gives other people power over you.  
Player: beggar  
Samir: Don't insult me, Player. I have never begged for anything in my life, nor do I ask for alms.  
Player: alms  
Samir: I don't need that.  
Player: forbidden  
Samir: These islands are cursed. No captain will bring you there on his own free will, that's for sure.  
Player: sin  
Samir: Regret your own sins before you judge others.  
Player: tiquanda  
Samir: All this bustle in the jungle makes me nervous.  
Player: Samir  
Samir: Right. But it's not me who said that.  
Player: bye  
Samir: Always watch your back, Player.
