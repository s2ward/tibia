Usually elves love to add a translation of their name which is often mistaken for a second name by other races. Since the elven language is far more complicated and has thousands of nuances, often elves with the same 'second name' have a different first name, confusing the other races even more.",

From there immense forces were evoked to open a gate through which the demonic armies entered our world.\nThe gate was opened, an army passed through, and the gate eventually closed again. The invading armies had no supplies and were finally destroyed. The demonic leaders made only rare appearances on the battlefield, probably summoned by their minions for a while.

Their families joined each other to travel together for a while, only to disband again soon whenever an area could not supply them all any longer. Hunted by countless enemies and almost everytime outnumbered when it came to fights with 'neighbours' they retreated into the deepest woods where the greater number of their foes was evened out. There they created encampments they visited now and then. They had contact with many creatures and cultures. They adopted ideas and inventions that suited their nomadic lifestyle and begun even a very cautious trade with other races to aquire things they were not able to build on their own. As the attention of the other races turned more and more away from the elves and wars broke out between them, some of the elves begun to live at their up to then only part time ecampment on a permanent base. Adopting what they had seen from other races and things they vaguely remembered from their own past some trading posts were established in this way. Usually only one to three families lived there. After the reunification with the Cenath the majority of them could be convinced to give a permanent settlement a try and the biggest tradingpost became the settlement Ab'Dendriel. Some families refused to join their brethren and continued to wander the world, only visiting the city now and then, each vistit convincing them more that they have only little in common with the Deraisim anymore. So they begun to see themselves as Abdaisim and continued to be the nomads and restless wanderers of elvenkind.",

This class of minotaurs was the only one who could live long enough to learn skills not directly connected to war. Since they were almost always the only ones who could gather enough experience and wisdom to create new ideas and concepts, the younger warriors begun to look at them as parents and advisors. Slowly these elders were able to change the war culture of the minotaurs. One charismatic minotaur in particular, Akkor, who was born blind, became the founder of the new minotaurian philosophy. He shunned the rage as a curse of the god Blog. Consequently, the minotaurian religion, which due to the extremity of martyrdom and rage never had a real chance to develop, turned away from the raging one. Slowly new concepts were adopted and great efforts were undertaken to hold the rage at bay. Meditation and self-control became the foremost duties of any warrior. The minotaurian ideal turned towards role models who were in control of body and mind. Since fiery rage was in minotaurian nature, young minotaurs were trained from early on to control themselves. It was through meditation that the minotaurs developed art and soon philosophy. Complicated ceremonies for usually simple things of daily life were developed to focus the mind, to be aware of each second of life.",

        "text": "The Blood Curse\nSages claim that we owe vampires to the dark deeds of some gods or demons. Some say, Urgith created them as a new tool for his wars. Others believe that vampires are an undead variation created by some powerful but not godlike being, very likely by one of the Ruthless Seven. Some think vampires are made by the Lord of the undead, other see Verminor as their creator. Again others see vampirism as some kind of curse.\nIt is said that the first vampire was a powerful warrior king who successfully fought the undead in the Corpse War. Being promised forbidden power and unification with his beloved ones, a once loyal follower of the king became the pawn of the dark powers. He poisoned his liege, probably over several months, using some nasty mixture which was handed to him.\nAs the king became sick and no one was able to heal him, the traitor stepped forward with a strange medicine. Trusting in his beloved servant, the king drank the medicine which actually was the blood of some servant that had been murdered recently. The medicine seemed to restore the king's strength, so the traitor had no trouble to feed him with more blood. Soon the king's appearance started to change. His aversion to sunlight and his paleness were attributed to his illness, but also the king's temper and behaviour turned more and more violent and aggressive. Nonetheless, the people loved their king and put up with his moods.\nThe traitor fuelled the king's growing paranoia with lies, so it was easy to convince him to get rid of certain court members. One by one the loyal advisers were removed and replaced with dark cultists. When the king was cut off from any loyal support, they stopped to give him blood and his illness returned, even worse than before. When he convulsed in pain and agony, they presented him a peasant to drain blood from. Almost insane by his ravenous thirst, the king accepted this sinister gift. As soon as he realised what was happening, he went berserk. In a fit of rage, he slaughtered each and every cultist that he encountered, but in the end they trapped him in his castle. The survivors fled with the corpse of the peasant who soon rose as a vampire. They drained him of his dark blood and killed him. Then they drank the blood to become vampires themselves.\nThe king was finally freed by loyal subjects. He had turned into something he had fought his whole life - an undead. It is said he left his castle in that very night, some say to hunt the traitors, others claim to end his undead life.",

The weak and fragile mortal body becomes a sophisticated tool that does not lose its function due to illness or old age.\nSeeing the mortals suffer under such influences alienates a vampire somewhat from humanity and makes it ever more clear that we are different.\nHumans and vampires are set apart from each other. \nWe remember mortality and see its weaknesses. We mourn the mortals even though our highly evolved existence raises us high above them. The wisdom we gain with our age is great. Freed of the shackles of mortality we have a clearer view of things. Knowing the envious fear with which some greedy and selfish humans view us, we hide from the eyes of overzealous inquisitors and clergymen.\nBehind the scenes we guide the humans through history, supporting the worthy and eliminating threats to humanity. We are the unseen movers and makers that hold kingdoms together, furthering ideas that improve societies and boosting discoveries.\nNot for gratitude, but to fulfil the obligation of passing some of our fortune on to those that are not as fortunate.\nA selected few grasp our status and have the greatness to live with their inferiority. In their own meek way they try to help us in our noble efforts. They are worthy above all others to become one of us one day. We do not take new vampires lightly of course. It can be a challenging and long journey to join our ranks. With diligence and intelligence a human might eventually convince a vampire of his worth.",

        "text": "Like most of the elder races, elves feel used and abandoned by the gods. The only gods some of them worship is Crunor, whom they call the \"Treefather\" and see him as bringer of life. Some of the elves prefer to pray to the raw elemental powers of earth and air. Mostly in the Kuridai caste the earth cult is more prominent than Crunor, and it is said that their complicated 'prayers' are more like summonings or invocations. It is believed by elvenkind that in their history seven elven lords acquired the status of celestial paladins and therefore are godlike beings. Worshipping them is a very personal matter though. It is certain that different high lords are more prominent in different castes but prayers and interpretation of the high lords is only shared on family level at best, usually each elf finds his own approach to some of the high lords, completely ignoring the other ones.\nMortiur - the ravager, prominent for some sects. The avenger, merciless against friend, foe and himself\nNera - the lady of spring (flowers, growth) completely replacing Crunor for some elves.\nDseyvar - the sworddancer, responsible for the grace of the warrior, elven warriors have to be graceful not chivalrous.\nPriyla - the daughter of the stars, mystery and magic\nKrynierr - the silver tongue, poetry, love and music\nAzmoda - the vieled one, mysterious figure. Mistress of schemes, cunning and deception.\nEvicor - the wanderer. Master of the hunt, the explorer",

        "text": "The Seeds of Life\nSpring is the time when the powers of the vital force are strongest. It is this time of the year when everything is growing and nature is vibrant of life. But not only nature is growing and giving birth, also the pure force of life is pulsating with energy and the power of creation. This energy often enters in living beings, making them stronger, healthier, and more fertile. Sometimes it enters in seeds of the most diverse plants. No one can tell what kind of plant may grow from these seeds, but many creatures instinctively feel the vital force in the seeds and collect them. Some creatures of nature think of these seeds as holy relics. They cannot stand the thought that those who they regard as defilers of nature could gain possession of such seeds. Therefore, the activity of those who see themselves as preservers of nature is unusually high in spring.\nDryads and other creatures of nature who are hardly ever seen for the rest of the year suddenly appear in great numbers and often pose a threat to unwary travellers of the woods. The fact that the powers of the vital force infuse them with additional energy makes matters only worse. For some time, whole forests might be impassable while the trees seem to come alive. Roots try to snare and trap travellers, walls of rapidly growing tendrils and thorns block passages, and dryads and tree spirits ambush exhausted and tired travellers. Still, not all dryads are that hostile. Some of them are even willing to trade these special seeds for other items or help the finder to cultivate the seed into a magnificent plant. Sadly such helpful spirits are rare and as capricious as all dryads. So you never can be sure what exactly to expect from them.\nStories are abound in which dryads deal seemingly peacefully with humans only to turn them into trees once they have earned their trust. Other stories tell about dryads that kidnapped humans and took them into their homes in some ancient tree where they had to work as servants forever. There are even stories about people who went to the dryads to trade with them or get some advice, and when they returned from their trips which had only lasted a few days, years or even decades had passed in their hometown. Of course most of these stories are fairy tales, exaggerations or outright lies, but mortals are well-advised to be extremely careful when dealing with dryads.",

        "text": "About Feyrist\nFeyrist is mainly populated by Fae. Rumour has it that it is located north-west of Roshamuul, bordered between high mountains to the southeast and the sea to the other cardinal directions. Deep forests and lush meadows are mixing up on the peninsula, dotted with lakes, brooks, hills, ravines and groves. The coast of Feyrist is partly sandy beaches, partly grassy shores. Feyrist has a temperate to warm climate, which has led to a lush, verdurous vegetation. Rich green pastures with various wild flowers and thick deciduous forests are dominating the peninsula. Most of the Fae live scattered all over the woods, there is just one bigger settlement, consisting of many Fae houses, a magical fountain and a tree that seems to be some kind of temple.\nFeyrist arose from the mortals' pleasant dreams. The reclusive magical realm is among the most secret areas of Tibia, characterised by an enchanted environment and pervaded by ancient magic. The Fae's skills of shaping wood and stone as well as their magical talent are their greatest benefits. The woods of Feyrist hold some rare magical plants. However, Feyrist lacks almost all infrastructure, simply because the fae don't have any need for it.\nThe Fae of Feyrist are forming different courts. Although not all of them belong to a fairy court, many of them do. Usually, the most powerful female fae is the leader of a court. Sometimes she refers to herself as queen. The queen is supported by several knights, male and female alike, who are acting as her personal guards as well as the court's defenders. Within a court there may be disagreements among single members, but overt struggles are rather uncommon. The courts are independent from each other. Conflicts between two courts are seldom.\nThe Fae are benevolent but also flighty and unpredictable creatures. They are more interested in dancing, making music and playing tricks on each other than in fighting, studying or constructing. Fae like sweets, wine, glittering trinkets, lyrics and music. The highest purpose in a Fae's life is usually to have fun and to live a carefree life. Some Fae are suspicious of strangers and tend to welcome them with avoidance in the best case. They feel foreigners disturb the area's solitude. Lately, however, one of the courts has shown some interest in the mortals, how the Fae call all strangers.\nThe Fae also have a spiritual side and perform various rites to celebrate the moon cycle and certain weather phenomena. They don't worship gods or greater spirits but nature itself, which they regard as a kind of supreme being. Apart from that, Fae care only for the here and now. Fae possess a distinct talent for the arcane powers and they have highly developed artisanal skills when it comes to shaping wood and stone. It is unclear whether the Fae have to eat in order to survive. However, they obviously enjoy eating sweets and fresh fruit as well as drinking wine.  So it can be assumed that they do it just for pleasure.",

        "text": "About the Fae\nThe Fae are secluded and mysterious creatures, living in forests, some of them also in caves beneath the earth. Their secret realm is the peninsula Feyrist. There is a less forested meadow area, which borders on the mountain chain, that seems to separate Feyrist from Roshamuul. A large forest is situated in the centre, here and there are small hills and clearings. Again and again one can discover bright crystal formations and in between, there are smaller rivers and lakes.\nThe Fae do not build any real cities, but inhabit trees, big mushrooms or huge snail shells. There are also tree houses and dwellings made of thick trunks. The Fae can shape wood and stone, so even large rocks may become houses. The Fae often decorate their glades and homes with flowers, tendrils and crystals.\nMany flowers, butterflies etc. indicate that the Fae are in close touch with nature. In addition, there are magical ponds and wells, mushroom circles and fairylike plants.\nThe Fae are mystical creatures that wield magical and elemental powers. They vary greatly in size and appearance. There are different kinds of fae like fauns, pixies, pookas, swan maidens and boogies. Most Fae are rather reclusive and live peaceful lives in their secret realm.  They only leave this realm when it is necessary, i.e. in the case of existential threats to their island. In order to protect their home, they can get quite fierce and resolute. In Feyrist though they are mostly playful and cheery. They rarely use arms, but if they do, the weapons are made of wood and stone.\nThe Fae believe that they will die or that their secret realm will be destroyed if strangers enter the island. For this reason, they live very secluded and protect their realm with a magical barrier from the outside world. Strangers are rarely granted access. If at all, then only after proving their trustworthiness.\nThe Fae know much about humans, elves and dwarves, the beings from whose dreams they mainly arise. Therefore, these races are more familiar to them than orcs, trolls or minotaurs. They know them, but only very rarely they also arise from their dreams. Members of other races seem to be either unable to enter the island or immediately sent back through dream portals.",

        "text": "The Teshial were never fighters. They retreated in the early days of war to hidden refuges, not as a whole caste but only in small family groups. Their hideouts were additionally protected by strong illusionary magic and offered them peace from the madness around them. These elves developed due to meditation and a special philosophy in the art of dream magic, dramatically enhancing their initial abilities in the decades. So they began to exist almost permanently in a state of dreams, only rarely appearing now and then amidst the other elves to give them advice and try to convince some of them to join their way of life. As the war grew more and more fierce these visits became less and less frequent until they were almost a myth, even for elvenkind. In the new awakening of the world they were some of the First to appear, apparently far less disoriented then other beings. Many races welcomed their help, but their teachings seldom found dedicated listeners. After they taught a part of their secrets to some humans they found worthy, they had to see their pupils tortured by developments they judged themselves guilty of. Also, other elves put pressure on the humans to give up the secrets of dreams. They withdrew from the world of mortals and it is rumored they have physically entered the realm of dreams. The Teshial are 'typical' in appearance for elves, but they could create the illusion of almost any appearance if they so choose. Some people even say that due to their enormous control of dreams they could shape their children as they wish, giving them human or even orcish appearance. On the other hand, even people who come up with such theories go silent when asked why an elf should choose to have a child that looks that way.",

Sunlight will dry them out and even turn them into dust. If you drive a wooden object into the heart of a vampire, the flow of the vampire's tainted blood is stopped, leaving him completely helpless. It should be mentioned, though, that if the heart is partly missed or if the object is not large enough, the vampire might still be able to move.\nSince a vampire is dead anyway, none of these methods allows to destroy a vampire for good. With enough time and blood, a vampire can recover from any of those seeming deaths. The only known way to permanently defeat a vampire is to kill him with a blessed stake.

        "text": "The elves are able to manipulate their unborn children by some kind of dream magic. This magic changes appearance and personality slightly, allowing elven parents to give birth to 'wish-kids'. In their shared dreams the elven parents seem to sculpture their child like a piece of art. Though most of the dream magic of the past is long forgotten, this rudimentary magic seems to be natural to the elves. It is possible to 'choose' things like hair or eye color and even gender. Even slight changes of the physique are possible, though considerable changes take place in the span of generations. Wise men assume this ability was a 'gift' of the gods to make more adaptable tools for the elves' war. But the mentality of the elves did not allow them to form their children in a 'convenient' way. Since most of this magic is instinctual, they form their children in an aesthetic way. On the other hand, what is seen as aesthetic is based on the philosophy of the parents and so their background changes this view dramatically. This is even more evident in the castes that were separated in the war.",

The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities.",

        "text": "The Rise of the Pumpkin\nAfter many wars and always new threats by the forces of darkness, humanity was afraid of many things. It was no cowardice but a gnawing fear that slowly eroded courage and faith. The servants of evil seemed to appear everywhere and in many horrible forms. Humans had grown accustomed to be afraid of the dark and the unknown. This weakened their resolve and with that also the forces of good. The gods came together to find a way to rise the spirit of humanity once again. They discussed and debated but could not come to an agreement because their views were too contrasting. And while they still deliberated, suddenly one of their least and minor creations stood amongst them. It was the lord of the rabbit race who had passed unnoticed by the mighty guardians. Without fear the little rabbit faced the gods who looked upon him in astonishment. Then the lord of the rabbits proposed his idea to the mighty and great gods. Since rabbits are tiny and their enemies are many, they are quite familiar with fear and how to handle it. So the lord of the rabbits came up with the idea to have the humans overcome their fear by learning to laugh in the face of evil. The gods were amazed by this simple but clever idea. So they chose the mightiest warrior of the rabbit race and bestowed magical powers upon him. The daring hare gained the protection of the gods and the power to disguise humans with hideous appearances of monsters. Each year, the hare would appear for some time and do his work. So the humans learnt to laugh and had fun while appearing as monsters, and the great fear that had darkened the souls of humans gradually vanished.\nThis enraged the forces of evil and so they called forth the most malevolent spirit from the realm of darkness. It was his task to spread fear among mankind once again. The spirit was sent to take possession of the greatest living hero among the humans and to wreak havoc in the name of darkness. Unbeknownst to them, the lord of the rabbits had anticipated that the forces of evil would strike back. So he had sent some spies to the realm of darkness and learnt about their plan in time. He warned the humans about the approaching danger and once again had the right plan to save the day. He asked the humans to build a puppet clad in a shining armor and to put it on a throne in the midst of their festivities. As the puppet's head served a pumpkin with a carved face. The clever hare had figured that a spirit from the depths of the realm of darkness was not familiar with humans and would assume the figure on a throne in the centre of festivities as humanity's greatest hero. And indeed he was proven right when the spirit arrived and tried to possess what he assumed a human body. But the spirit had immense powers and so he finally managed to take possession of the pumpkin head on the cost of nearly all of his powers. With hardly any power left, the spirit made the pumpkin move and began to attack the celebrating humans. But the humans had long regained their courage and were not afraid to fight back. They drove off the evil pumpkin that escaped to some remote place where he was finally banished from the world. It took the spirit one year to regain enough of his strength to fight his way back into reality. He re-entered the world at the place of his defeat and to his shock and dismay he was no longer a spirit but bound to a pumpkin-like body. The beast roared in rage but could do little about it. Again he tried to wreak havoc in the world but again valiant heroes stopped his rampage and banished him for another year. Since this day on, the spirit returns every year hoping that one day humanity will be weakened enough for him to finally take revenge.",

It is a subconscious way of influencing the surroundings. It is mainly used by elven parents that want to shape their unborn child, but, this is the far more important threat, some elves, especially those called \"Teshial\" posess the ability to wander some kind of \"dream realm\" instead of the real world. This gives them the oppurtunity to appear somewhere out of the blue, but, fortunately, the Teshial never used this skill to ambush, and the other elves posess only small remnants of this magic.\nNever the less, the 2nd earthen chamber is evolving a counter spell for that, that increases the elemental signature of beings near, forcing them into the real realm.\nThe other kinds of their magics are limited to protective and growing spells, whicht yet do not prove any harm, but are very supportive for their strife. It is rumored that they have also a lot of illusionary and concealing spells, but investigations here have not yet led to final results, as well as we can only deny the existance of aggressive magic by an elven race od caste od unknown origin.\nFor further information refer to sub-report AX-27.",

Stripped of almost any possesions, they hid in the caves and learned to become very secretive. They had to work very hard, had to fight for almost any goods with nature and ferocious beasts. Most beasts that could live in such livethreatening circumstances were that powerfull that direct attacks proved to be futile. So the elves begun to develop a more devious way to fight, with assaults, traps and hit and run tactics. After over hundred years they had enough resources to leave the burning lands and adopted their way of live to their new enviroment. So they became the secretive people under the hills. They were fierce fighters whenever their new home was threatened. Some hundred years they fought off all intruders until their explorers made contact with the other remaining elven casts. Under the growing pressure of the more and more powerful waves of orcish attacks they left their homes to join forces with the other elves in an uneasy alliance. Their apperance had changed to a even more slender Version of the normal elves. Their skin is very pale, their hair pure white or pitch black. The younger members of that cast often color strands of their hair in unusual clors like red, blue or purple. Red, albinotic eyes are common, but in general all kinds of eyecolors are existent.",

They also have a great city, comparable to a capital, there, which is called Ab'Dendriel, and is mainly inhabitated by Deraisim and Cenath. The defenses are rather weak, and it seems like a lot of nomads and wanderers pass through the region.\nWe also found ruins within the hidden mystic valley, the structure of the buildings is typically elven. The ruins seem to be the result of a harsh thunderstorm of magic, but it was too long ago for us to find closer traces.\nMore interesting should be the fact, that the volcanic regions beyond the thundery mountains seem to be colonised by the elves as well. There dwells a race called Kuridai, and they seem to be the most aggressive and militant elves we encountered yet.\nSuggestions about possible assault targets if war will be at hand are envoiced in sub-report EY-01.",

He let the people bleed in the name of the pharaoh and amassed huge amounts of gold, most of which somehow ended up in his own private treasury. But Shehamin, the second wife of the pharaoh, was not a woman to be fooled easily. Using cleverness and charm she brought his schemes to light and told her husband about them. Esuph III was furious, and his verdict on the fraudulent tax inspector was as cruel as it was clever: The screaming tax collector was sunk into a cauldron full of boiling gold. The terribly distorted statue which as the result of this peculiar treatment was put up in the tax office as a grim reminder that fraud can seriously affect your health. The gold that was stolen by the tax collector, however, was never found, and to this day there are many who dream about finding the unfaithful tax collector's hidden treasure.",

We were shocked by the sheer impertinence of his speech! The fool! How confused he looked when he realised our disapproving silence. I am convinced he had spoken to some of those filthy heretics before he went to see his majesty. I know there are some although none of them would dare to make his blasphemous opinions known in the public. How could the mighty pharaoh not ignore this ambitious fool and his futile plans. How haughtily he walked around in our beautiful Ankrahmun, mocking our true religion with his silly questions. Of course, he got nowhere and he seemed to give up in the end. But did the wisdom offered to him enlighten his blind soul? I think not. So full of himself was he, so firm in his heretic opinions and yet such a slave to his flesh - how could he understand that which is true and holy? People like him are both a curse and a blessing to us, the children of enlightenment. They may insult and provoke us with their ignorance, yet it is when we meet fools like him that we realise the full extent of the glorious state of enlightenment we live in. Far from ascension though we are, we have been granted the opportunity to achieve what will be forever denied to people like him - divinity!",

Although no proof was found there was a general sense of agreement that no proof was necessary since everybody was convinced of the beggar's guilt. In a rare display of mercy the judge sentenced him to a mere three years of work in the salt mines. The widow Zehmahil claimed that the travelling bard Todd Ballory had promised here mariage in exchange for certain services that have not been further elaborated on in the court's documents. The foreigner was found guilty without trial and sentenced to three years of work in the salt mines. The footsoldier Kamahl claimed his father Indril was guilty of witchcraft. Several obscure texts were found beneath the accused person's bed. Indril was banished from the city and his property was equally divided between the pharaoh and his heirs. The foreigner Todd Ballory was pronounced guilty of killing the overseer Barnak, a father of sixteen children and a respectable member of the local whipcrackers' association. The aforementioned convict was sentenced to a rather spectacular final appearance in the local arena.",

It was a marvel to behold, made of black glass and gold, and everybody who looked at it was filled with an eerie sense of foreboding. The vizier was rumoured to be so powerful that no one dared to bring him to justice. Even Rahmen Tah himself feared the power of his vizier, and he did not dare to send troops against the vizier. Finally he called for his chief astrologer and mathematician, the wise Athem, and asked him for advice. Athem listened quietly to the words of his pharaoh.

His advice was this: The pharaoh should order a huge celebration to be held, and all pyramids should be adorned with flowers and flags. The pharaoh who trusted in the wisdom of his advisor ordered his people to prepare for the celebration. While the people did as their pharaoh had ordered them to do Athem began to build a huge wooden machine on top of the royal pyramid. No one took much notice of it because of the preparations that were going on. On the fourth day when the celebration was scheduled to start the pharaoh sent an invitation to his vizier and asked him to join in their festivity. As Athem had foreseen the vizier declined because he suspected that there was a trap. Instead he sat in the observatory at the top of his tower and watched the city because he wanted to find out what the pharaoh was up to. Too late did he understand that the construct on top of the pyramid was in fact an enormous catapult. Suddenly a huge boulder was hurled in his direction. The shot had been perfectly calculated, and it hit its mark with amazing precision. The top of the dark tower shattered and the evil vizier was crushed underneath tons of basalt. His death caused the dark magic to disappear, and the tower sank into the ocean forever.",

        "text": "Tales of a Stranger, Part I\nIt was in a time of dread that a stranger came to our lands. More dead than alive was he when he was found in the desert, and the merchants who found him took pity on him and brought him hither. But how great was the amazement and the wonder when it turned out that he wore a birth-mark on his neck that looked exactly like a scarab! The crowd was struck with awe, and it was soon decided that he was to be taken to the priests, so that they might ask the gods for an omen. And so it came that while the man was still lying in a slumber full of delirious dreams the priests burnt incense and performed the ancient rituals to ask the gods for advice and for guidance. The high priest climbed the highest pyramid and called for the knowledge of the wind and the wisdom of the sand. For three long days the stranger was caught in the perilous lands that separate life from death, and for three long days the priest was haunted by visions. But when those days had passed, everything changed. All of a sudden the stranger opened his eyes and looked around in amazement, and it was that very moment that the delirious priest began to utter a prophecy.",

They called for the stranger, who seemed to have lost his memory, to be brought to the temple, where they talked to him and asked him all kinds of questions. But much to their dismay he could not give them the answers they sought, for his memory seemed to be blank like the surface of the desert after a sandstorm. However, the priests had the wisdom of the secret prophecy to guide them, and so they knew that they had to give the strangers five tasks to fulfil before they could reveal his destiny to him. And so they did, and the stranger swore he would fulfil all the tasks or die in the attempt. His first task was to travel into the desert and to find the eldest of the scarabs there, so that the priests would reveal their wisdom to him and fill his empty mind with recollections. The stranger descended deep into the burrows of the scarabs in order to face their judgement and to find answers that had been lost in the desert sand aeons ago. But the stranger never returned.",

Pharaoh Uthemath ordered that she and her newborn baby were to die in the arena. Four behemoths were let loose on her. But just before the raging monsters could put their claws on her a flying carpet swept down from the sky and rescued both the mother and her child. The Thaian nobleman - for who else would it be but him - somehow managed to evade the hails of arrows that greeted him, and so the couple managed to make their escape northwards. The pharaoh demanded that both the nobleman and his own unfaithful daughter be handed over to him, but the Thaian king claimed he had no knowledge of their whereabouts. So the trace of the traitorous daughter was lost.",

And still the real thing eluded us. The remnants of the legendary cities of old seemed lost to the desert. But we carried on, working day and night, digging at the same spot over and over again.

There are numerous problems, though, and it is well possible that we have to start all over again. This would mean, of course, that we would have to create some spells to obtain information by means of magic which is plain to see when you are close to the targeted person.

If only we found a way to use a spell or a spell-like ability to define non-target groups we could finally make the spell work. For now, however, we have stopped the research because we felt it is necessary to create the groundwork for future research in the field. The question is: Should we focus on working out a special definition spell, or is it actually possible to weave some sort of divination spell into the pattern of the foeburner in order to receive a satisfying result with a single spell. I am somewhat inclined towards the latter option because of the satisfactory results we have recently achieved in the field of divination magic.",

One day as the princess wept because of all the pain and the evil ways of the world the djinns came to comfort her. And since they loved her so much they called upon their powers to grow a garden of magnificent beauty. From now on, Maharuh visited her enchanted garden whenever she was sad, and she never went there but a smile came to her face, and she found new strength to continue her work with renewed vigour and inspiration. But humans grow old and weary, and time did not fail to do its cruel work on fair Princess Maharuh. As she grew old her visits to the garden became less and less frequent and one day when she laid down to rest underneath her favourite tree she never woke up again. The garden was perhaps the most valuable thing she left behind, and it was certainly the one she had held dearest while still alive. But her people did not share her love for nature's beauty, and all they saw was a splendid example of horticulture that could be turned into money. Soon after her death a merchant caravan came, and the strangers offered great sums for the garden and for all that belonged to it. They dug out the trees and took the fruit because they believed they could rebuild the garden in their native land. However, soon after the caravan had left the city a terrible sandstorm arose. After the storm had cleared the caravan was gone and with it all that was left of the garden.",

        "text": "Researchpaper 56-09 A\nWe lost three mages in our last attempt at performing a controlled demon summoning. It is still too difficult to predict in what way the fabric of time and space is affected by the breach of the sphere, and from what we have seen the backlash of nature against demonic incursion can range from a slightly offensive odour to a sizeable explosion such as the one we saw yesterday. I am personally disappointed to observe that the elemental protection spells we put up did not work at all. Perhaps there is some truth in the reports that the unleashed energy is of purely entropical nature. We have yet to decide whether or not it makes sense to create an entropic counterspell first, but I support the idea that the loss of manpower while trying to balance the spell is manageable. It is possible, though, that this will lead to no convincing result at all due to the uncontrollable nature of the demonic realm. If this should be the case the use of entropic countermagic is the only option left.\nBy the way: The summoning of lesser creatures, the so-called 'reds', progressed comparatively well. Of course, these creatures are mere borderdwellers and may consequently not be considered true demons. However, it may prove that the development of summoning spells for 'reds' will prove a rewarding spin-off of demon summoning research.",

        "text": "Suns and Stars, Part I\nIt stands to reason that the stars and the suns influence the flow of magic. The astral patterns wax and wane like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual. The more mana is used in a spell the more it is susceptible to extratibian influence. For this reason it seems quite safe to assume that certain powerful rituals are only possible when the stars are correctly aligned. We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail.",

Other, more complex rituals may only be performed at very specific times, perhaps even at a specific hour. Other rituals that are more complex still are bound to specific days, and to specific times as well. In fact, some individual spells can only be performed once a year or once every other year, while the most powerful of rituals may only be carried out during stellar constellations that are so incredibly rare that centuries may pass before the ritual can be performed again. Given the power and knowledge of the ancients it seems reasonable to assume that they have prepared rituals whose time has not even come to this very day. Since most of the ancient races have disappeared from the lands it is well possible that some of the rituals are still be buried in some long forgotten ruin, while others might actually be in the possession of some surviving heir of one of the ancient races.\nWho knows. The astrological knowledge of the ancients is yet to be rediscovered. We are perfectly positive that some of the discoveries we have made can be considered as the groundwork for further, more elaborate theories which one day might rival that of the ancients. Still, it would be an immense progress if we could rediscover some of the ancients' lost astrological writings.",

Though most of these loners followed the path that the gods had planned for them, some lacking restraint and company became driven made by their loneliness. Crazed they defied the gods and banded together, accumulating an army of the mad and the lost. This army they lead onto a rampage through the battlefields of their days. They caused havoc and destruction on both sides but ultimately they were crushed and thought dead. But some of them survived, hidden at unholy places and feeding on them. In time they grew in power and when they arose again they were horrible to behold. Their rise fell into a time of relative peace, after the reawakening and those relics of war disdained what they saw. Where others saw harmony they saw weakness. Where others saw love, they saw a lack of ambition. They renewed their old bonds and looked for fallen allies of days long past. They reformed the legion, which was a mockery of the power of the past. Yet their madness, hatred and ambition drove them forward. They began to look for the guidable, the power-hungry and baited them with poisoned promises. They are still out there, scheming, manipulating, looking to increase their power in clear defiance of all gods.",

The test subjects complained about severe problems when moving, and some actually suffered from partial paralysis or even from acute petrification! However, I still believe the spell might be useful as some sort of emergency measure because I imagine that turning oneself into a statue for a while might come in handy when all other options have failed. Oddly enough it is quite simple to focus the spell into an object, preferably an amulet, so the change is still bound to an object that serves as a transmitter. Obviously the problem is related to the one we had when we tried to channel certain spells through runes. I'm afraid that while research covering spontaneous magic has made great advances since the early days we are still at the beginning when it comes to channelled spells.",

Their sense of smelling fear is infallible, and once they have found their prey a mere crack in a wall is large enough for them to enter. Once they are close to their victims they feast on their innermost fears, evoking images of horror and despair that are so horrible that they often cause the dreamer's death.

So strong was this altar's magic that it fused the parts to form the famous Helmet of the Ancients as soon as they were placed on it. Eight helmets Arkhothep crafted, one for himself and one for each of his allies. But he did not fully trust his fellow conspirators, so he inserted ordinary rubies into their helmets, while his own helmet was imbued with the eternal power of a soul ruby. This way those helmets had only a fraction of his own helmet's powers. But Arkhothep's precautions against his allies went further than that. He only revealed the secret to forge one single part of the helmet to each of them, and each of them was taught the secret to forge a  different part. Arkhothep clearly saw through his allies' greedy natures. He knew they would never share their knowledge with each other, and he foresaw that their greed would make them plot against each other rather than against him.",

And so he forged the parts of the mask and assembled it on the demonic altar he secretly built in the centre of the complex beneath the great pyramid that was supposed to become the final resting place of his father. The magic of the altar was that strong, that its power could fuse the parts to become the famous helmet of the ancients, when they even came close to it. He crafted eight helmets for him and his allies. His own helmet was imbued with the eternal power of a soul ruby, but his co-conspirators had to rely on ordinary rubies to obtain at least a fraction of the power of their master's helmet. Each of them was granted the secret to forge a single part of the helmet. Arkhothep knew they would never share their knowledge with each other and their greed would lead them to diffuse their energies to plot against each other instead of working against him.",

        "text": "Rewar the bloody was a petty man of intrigue with the aspiration to become king. Through manipulation and deception he acquired a great deal of power. To raise his status he claimed several heroic deeds of others as his own. Though he silenced anyone who could put his exploits into question, suspicions amongst his knightly peers begun to rise. When he claimed the dragon slaying by a shepherd, who was assumed to have died in the fight, as his own, another knight confronted him with a wounded but alive shepherd and called his bluff. Rewar, seemingly infuriated, demanded a trial by combat, thinking that he would easily best a mere herder of sheep, unskilled in the use of arms. When he learned that not the shepherd but the accusing knight would be his opponent he fled the court the night before the trial and hid in a remote castle at the border. There he lead a life as a robber baron for a while until a force of the realm drove him out. He became a traveller, visiting many wonders of the known world and beyond. He served as a sword for hire for some time, but serving did not suit him well and he abandoned his employers often in the time of greatest peril. Often he did so, with a good part of the employers wealth. Some he betrayed for gold, others out of spite. With his reputation ruined his traveling intensified. As an old man he returned to the realm and bought himself a pardon by a young, new king with his ill-gotten wealth. While a few old knights who remembered him and his misdeeds tried to put him on trial again, through intrigue and bribery he dogged their accusations until he finally died of old age.",

So great was the wisdom of Arkhothep that he granted his father eternal unlife, so that he may to atone for his sins and become worthy of ascension. Who knows? Perhaps one day he, too, will ascend, leaving both the curse and his tomb behind him and taking his place at Arkhothep's side. But I fear his folly defies all attempt to cure it.

It is strongly advisable to keep the substance in the casket. I opened it once and minutes later it swarmed with rotworms and carrion worms. Many of my people died in this accident. We presume that we deal with an attractant of a rotworm queen. No one has ever seen one but we are pretty sure that this species is organised by a queen.

        "text": "The Astonishing Fairy Tale of the Little Piglet and the Isle of Evil\nOnce upon a time there was a little piglet named Ethan. But it was not an ordinary piglet but a piglet that wanted to become a detective. I, the cat Sandy, was his best friend ever and so we decided that his dream should become true. With our friends, Harry the owl and Monty the dog, we founded a detective agency. One day, while playing at the beach, we found some ominous footsteps in the sand. Ethan immediately knew that these were the footsteps of a criminal and we all decided to pursue the trail and catch the villain. After a while we reached a spot where the footsteps vanished in the sea. At first, me and my friends were clueless what to do, but then Harry's keen eyes spotted a harbour not that far away. By chance our old friend Wesley the weasel was working in the harbour and could provide us not only with a boat but also with some good advice. So we finally set sails and used Monty's amazing ability to follow a trail by scent to find our way across the sea. Eventually we reached an island that was thoroughly evil. It took all our courage and bravery to make our way through the dangerous territory to the dominating structure of the evil tower that loomed over the whole isle. We were well aware that the master of that tower had to be the epitome of evil and we had to enter his tower, regardless of the dangers involved. Only few had ever reached the isle and none of them had ever returned to tell the tale. But we were there and knew that it was our destiny to face the master of the isle. Retreat was not an option. We braved all the dangers that the isle seemed to throw against us and finally stood in front of the tower. Who would carry on our work if we failed? We knew if we did not stop the master of this isle then it might take decades until somebody else would find this isle, and then it might be too late to stop the fiendish plot that threatened the whole world. So we made it to the top of the tower and confronted its evil master! To our surprise it was no one else than our old rival Melvin the mouse! He switched on the lights which blinded Harry, threw a stick that Monty was forced to pursue, and then, to my shame, confronted me with a ball of yarn so huge I could not resist but had to play with it. But just as Melvin the mouse laughed evilly, Ethan, with an incredibly effort of will, ignored the mud the cunning mouse had just prepared to distract him and captured the culprit. With Melvin being caught, we others regained our composure and senses and returned to out little ship. We handed Melvin over to his mother and he was not allowed to eat any sweets for two weeks. This is the end of my little story about the isle of evil.",

        "text": "The art of war by Brianna Bonecrusher\nTo win a war, or even a fight, one has to discard certain ideals of nobility and honour. While honour is a noble concept it is less noble to let your soldiers die because you follow some lofty goal. As a leader it is your foremost duty to ensure that as many of your soldiers as possible return home, unharmed, in tact and preferably victorious. This can't be done by open battles that follow some sort of code. Battles have certain dynamics that makes any code obsolete after the initial clash anyway. Therefore, the surest tactic for success is to weaken the enemy as much as possible before you even think about engaging them in battle at all. A hit and run tactic is a wonderful strategy for achieving this aim. This requires the army to operate in small groups, making the maximum use of the terrain, traps and distance weapons. Let the environment cause as much harm as possible. Force your enemy to seek its way through treacherous countryside, lure them into the lairs of animals and monsters and don't give them the chance to restock supplies. Don't grant them the comfort of an undisturbed rest. Harass and attack them constantly from afar so they never feel safe. Bleed them out and wear them down and don't let them retreat to safety because then they might return, and be better prepared as they are wise to the guerilla tactics you use. The main goal is always to keep your own casualties low. If the enemy has no or little distance attacks you might be able to pick many of his soldiers off without any meaningful retaliation. Let your distance fighters aim for key figures first whenever possible. If you face enemies with numerous distance fighters attack them under cover of night using your own shooters spread out wide and roughly aiming for the enemy's camp. When forced to fight in close quarters, use an ambush strategy whenever possible. If possible, be prepared for a hasty retreat when things turn out nasty. She who fights and runs away will live to fight another day.",

        "text": "Whatever became of Leetha Arnadette?  Volume 2\nThe editorial team charged with the task of editing Arnadette's writings was hopelessly overwhelmed. Not only did the man write unceasingly himself, he was also capable of dictating three books to scribes at the same time. He rested only to sleep and eat, and that infrequently. His Editor in Chief had the idea of turning to the sorcerer Eclesius to create a Scribe Golem to keep up with the stream of literature. Eclesius found the idea wonderful (and the monetary reward was probably not too unwelcome either) After many false starts and several fatal accidents (not for Eclesius or the Editor, obviously) the Scribe Golem was completed. Not only was this Golem capable of editing and writing down Arnadette's work at the same pace as the author, it was also capable of banding the books, leaving the editorial team with little more to do than distribute the end product to various libraries. (Eclesius also installed some improvements - for instance, pages in Tibian books no longer needed to be turned, the reader simply had to scroll down the text to read what was written, as Eclesius believed page turning to be a waste of energy and an interruption to the flow of a good book.) While this meant that Arnadette's works could finally be recorded without a backlog building up, Arnadette himself began to suffer. Whenever he wished to break to sleep, eat, or anything else, the Golem would go on the rampage screaming \"More Books! More Books!\" and start destroying the interior furnishings. Eventually, the editorial team left one by one, unable to help Arnadette, and in fear of their lives should he ever cease to produce literature leading to the Golem going fully out of control. Eclesius was also strangely uncontactable. The Editor in Chief stuck with his old master as long as he could, but even he, in his old age was forced to abandon him.\nThe libraries are still being filled by his books - so which version is true? A man held in thrall by a Golem, forced to write day and night without break for sleep nor rest or are unscrupulous want-to-be writers attempting to make a quick buck off the back of a literary legend? This book is a plea for help! For your childhood memories of good books, the brave adventurers who read this book, please find out whatever became of Leetha Arnadette!",

        "text": "Whatever became of Leetha Arnadette?  Volume 1\nThere is not a Tibian who does not know of Leetha Arnadette, Tibia's most prolific author. He has written books in almost every genre, from horror to history, fact to fiction, children's bedtime stories to university textbooks. Which pupil has not groaned inwardly when told to learn by heart passages from Arnadette's \"Tibia - A History\" (Or even outwardly groand - an action that cost this humble author three days off school with concussion - how was I to know my teacher was a high ranking paladin and the champion of the Rat Hurling Guild and a deadly shot with a board rubber?) Which babe has not been lulled into sweet dreams by Arnadette's \"Nighttime tales for tiny Tibian tots\"? Who has not wished to be Gerrick, the hero of \"Jungle Adventure\", and which adolescent has not been terrified by the story of the \"Northwood Wolves\"? No tourist in his right mind would consider travelling without Arnadette's \"Rough Guide to Tibia\" and even some households would be poorer for the lack of \"Tibian Cooking Today, 1001 ways to serve Fish.\"\nMany have wondered exactly where he got his inspiration from. His writings cover such a wide range of topics to such depth of expertise, that in his former years he must have been a great explorer and a well read student. However, there are no records of him ever having studied at any academy in Tibia and even grandparent's grandparents talk of him as an old man - which has led to the rumour that elven blood runs in his veins. Those who used to see him on his monthly trips out to the shops in his home town reported that he would often stop dead in his tracks, emit sparks from his beard, then grab a notebook from his robes and scribble frantically. Indeed there is one story that stated that he took three days to make it down the street, and citizens of Carlin took pity on his scribbling form and made sure he had food and drink. It is these rare sightings of Arnadette that led many to believe that he was either blessed (or cursed) with Godly inspiration, that he had been selected by the Gods as their scribe. In a world with so many Gods, this is an unfortunate fate for one man to bear, and also leads to the interesting question of exactly which God was responsible for the book titled \"Why Rabbits Should be Blown up on Sight\".\nArnadette has not been seen for many years, although he continues to produce books with incredible speed. Rumours had begun to circulate that he was actually dead and other writer's were selling books under his name simply to earn money. However, an old man, apparently his editor, has spoken out, claiming to know the truth about his sad fate. Whether the following fantastic tale is a true confession or the ramblings of a senile man remains to be seen, but it is the author's belief that this story should be brought to the attention of the public, so people braver than I may try to save Arnadette from a fate worse than ... well ... a bad fate.",

        "text": "Tibiantis\nSomewhere to the South of the city which nowadays is known as Carlin, could once be found an isle, believed to be the cradle of human civilisation. Here, the first Tibians saw the light of the two suns and founded the first Kingdom. It grew to be a place of wisdom and wonder. Under the guidance of the Gods, humanity prospered in terms of wealth and knowledge to heights that no other civilisation has reached before or since. This city was called Tibiantis, and it grew beyond the bounderies of the land, spreading into the sea itself. Wonder upon wonder could be found in this city of ivory and gold. Explorers from Tibiantis braved the oceans and built outposts in the farthest reaches of the world. It is said of the denizens of this wonderful city that the elements themselves were at their beck and call and that no foe was strong enough to oppose them. However, they grew complacent and self satisfied, forgetting that everything they were and everything they had built up had been done only because they were favoured of the Gods. Eventually, they forgot their Gods, believing instead that they were the masters of the world. The Gods were saddened as they watched those who had made them so proud turn their backs upon them, and turned their eyes from them. Without the protection of the Gods, the city of Tibiantis was doomed. Its wealth and arrogance made it an irresistable target for the forces of evil. Their day of reckoning came - the Isle was sunk, the beautiful sculptured architecture of the towers of ivory and gold crumbled and the citizens drowned, the achievements and inventions of the civilisation lost forever beneath the waves.\nOnly the highest tip of the highest mountain of the isle remained as a tiny island, a pitiful memory of the greatness that once existed here. Legends state that this isle cannot be reached by normal means. The versions of the legend vary - some claim the isle is inhabited by diabolic creatures ensuring Tibiantis may never rise again and others state that benevolent messengers of the Gods live there and mourn for the lost children and warn others of the fate that threatens those who forget their Gods. The city itself rests on the lowest point of the ocean floor, and those inhabitants who were unfortunate to survive were twisted into abominal sea creatures. The colonies and outposts of Tibiantis did not survive the downfall of their home for long. They fell prey to the numerous enemies their people had made and who no longer feared retaliation. Only a few of their inhabitants survived to found new cities in remote places. Though they forgot their heritage they finally grew in numbers and created new cities and kingdoms, some of which still thrive in the present day.",

        "text": "The Northwood Wolves\nThe woods north of Carlin were home to numerous wild beasts. Packs of wolves were only one part of the fearsome fauna inhabiting the forests. So when sheep and cattle disappeared, no-one paid too much attention. Hunters were sent and they killed some of the wolves, however, the numbers of livestock stolen did not reduce. However, it was when humans fell victims to the wolf attacks that people turned to the Queen for aid. The conclave of druids, however, intervened and prevented the people from hunting down and killing every last wolf. They promised to take care of the problem themselves. Four of their most knowledgable beastlords were charged with the task of ending the threat. Only one returned, wide-eyed with fear and unable to speak coherently of what he had seen. And now, the true reign of terror began - whole farmsteads were attacked and their inhabitants torn apart and devoured. The druids organised a force of hunters and spellcasters. They fought their way through the woods, facing packs of wolves who seemed to be fighting as organised forces with an almost human intelligence. Despite winning the battle they failed to win the war and the ultimate source of the evil controlling the wolves, and more people fell victim to the wolves' attacks. The following winter a blood smeared adolescent was found, wandering aimlessly through the woods. His name was Charles Farmer. Shaking and half mad, those who found him were able to piece together his confession. He claimed he had killed his mother with a silver candelebra to make the wolf in her stop doing evil things. The boy was given over to the care of the druids, who took him in and protected him and the community from his madness. After this incident, the attacks on the farms and killings in Northwood ceased from one day to the next.",

        "text": "Duke Krule was born into a zealous family of thaian nobility. His oppressive and pious upbringing suited him well and from early age he joined an order of knights, dedicated to erase anything they deemed heretic. It was not much a choice of heart but the only sanctioned opportunity to escape the control of his overbearing father. The knights run several campaigns against the orcs and minotaurs mostly. Picking easy targets they were met with little resistance and the already very loose organisation of the order begun to dissipate more and more with the members often following their own petty agendas. Krule lead several raids against renegade orcs and later human bandits. His claiming of the loot did not suit the victims of the robbers well so as an empty gesture towards them, Krule disposed captured criminals in a rather gruesome fashion, claiming his campaigns were rather aimed at discouraging other criminals, then reclaiming stolen goods. With a growing strength and order in the kingdom, his targets became less and less and so he begun campaigns far from the borders to strike any easy target that seemed suitable. Under the pretence of doing the god's work, he begun to plunder ancient ritual sites and burial grounds of what he deemed heathens. Over time he and his war band had degraded into little more than bandits and grave robbers. Although operating far from the realm and not facing imminent threats, his acts of cruelty continued. It's not known if these vile acts lead to some shaman to curse him or if he was cursed in some ancient tomb which treasures he stole. But it's safe to say that his later years were spent in campaigns of slaughter and fire to acquire the means to end at least some form of curse. The nature of the curse could never truly be determined as he and all who accompanied him were slaughtered by an orcish warlord and his army in an ambush. Some brethren of his order later reclaimed his remains and despite his deeds and reputation gave him a proper burial.",

Befriending the citizens is not done easily. Trading with them can often be tiresome and even dangerous when looking at their temper in combination with alcohol. All in all, one could assume that Svargrond is rather an unlikely ally for our respectable Carlin but for strategical and economical reasons it is quite the contrary. Svargrond is one of the cities easily accessible by us that is not under the sway of Thais in some form. A dominance of Thais in Svargrond could severely hamper our seafaring and trade.\nThe harsh environment of the northern isles makes Svargrond an interesting trading partner from an economical point of view. Many of our goods cannot be created by themselves or would be extremely expensive if they were produced with their own resources. Although the mining operations have not really been running again yet, there is still an abundance of resources that we can trade for our goods as soon as Svargrond's economy has developed somewhat more. For now, we mainly trade amber, ivory, bones, furs, and meat. Later, we hope to be able to trade for ores, gemstones and even shaman-made potions and elixirs. Sadly the cultural differences still pose a severe problem for our trades or the expansion of our post here. Although our fighters gained some respect, the prominence of alcohol in that culture is a constant thorn in our side. Officially it has been declared not to make an issue of this difference, but sometimes this is easier said than done when facing some threatening drunkard. So against earlier plans, we maintain only a minor presence in Svargrond. This tactic seems to work well as he barbarians are not fond of intrusions in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, their constant war with their even less civilized brethren in the south hampers our ambitions to get a hold on the resources of the isles. On the other hand, it makes our wares even more valuable for the besieged people of Svargrond.",

        "text": "The close relationship with Carlin has served the druids quite well over the years. In Thais, the druids had only a minor role which was always overshadowed by the sorcerer guild and its close ties to the Thaian throne. In Carlin, however, the druids were seen as trusted advisers for the young city. This early cooperation led to the growth of Carlin in a more harmonic and environmental way than any other city. Right from the beginning, druids instructed the people of Carlin in the ways of nature and watched over the city's development. Moreover, there was a constant demand for the druids' help which resulted in the use of druidic powers in some practical ways that were never thought of before. Additionally, the need of the people led to experiments to expand the druidic powers in new ways. This lead to some significant progress of the druids' magic. Although critics call this approach too practical and too less metaphysical, it is undeniable that new magical practices arose in those days that shaped the druidic research significantly. With additional resources and freedom, the druidic art flourished along with the city, and the teachings of the druids reached more people now that they were always present and no longer hid in some distant caves. The dynamic aspect of the process helped both sides and led to a new boom in druidic magic.\nNow that some contact with Svargrond was established, there are even new chances to reintegrate what many see as early offshoots of druidism developed through contact with shamans. Even though it is a painfully slow process to leave behind prejudices and cultural differences, it is widely accepted that both traditions can learn from each other. The combination of two branches of the same magical teaching that took different paths for centuries might lead to new and unknown heights of druidism that might even herald in a new age of magic.",

        "text": "The contact with the elves was mainly based on the mutual hatred of orcs and other monsters. In the past, the elves' acceptance of Carlin was founded on the fact that one of them was likely to be the next victim of another orc invasion. With Carlin's strength growing, the elves' opinion began to shift. Some even saw a threat in Carlin's growth, however, most agreed that in the case of an orcish threat both cities forces combined might be able to stop the green flood now. Still, there was only minor trade between Carlin and Ab'Dendriel since both cities strived for independence. Only when the orcish threat decreased and an invasion became unlikely, the trade began to flourish somewhat. Still, the alien culture of the elves makes it hard to have any meaningful negotiations. Particularly the complicated caste system with different leaders makes it very difficult to come to some kind of agreement that would please everyone.",

        "text": "The Amazons Vol.3\nThis background of political conflict led to the ascendance of Amaza Saphira, an alchemist with an unusual talent for inspirational speeches and leadership. She claimed to have had visions of Banor and Elaine, informing her of the natural superiority of womankind. Although her political opponents attempted to discredit her, calling her delusional and stating that her visions were the results of noxious fumes concocted in her laboratory, Amaza'S speeches spoke to many people, and her radical viewpoint inspired many to join her cause. It was her belief that men were inferior beings and that Carlin was an acomplishment of womanhood. She wanted to drive all men from the city, or keep them in subjugation serving only in menial positions. She wanted to expand the army to demonstrate the strength of womanhood. Though she gained many followers, her radical position served as an example of the dangers of extremism and finally, the Queen felt pushed into a more moderate way of handling the army and its leadership.\nAmaza, however, was not content with the Queen's decision and continued to gather followers amongst the population, many of them in the Queen's own army. What Amaza possessed in charisma and oratory she lacked in subtlety and secrecy. So her plan to overthrow the Queen and become a warrior queen in her place was doomed to failure before it could even begin. Although parts of the army sympathized with her ideas, not all were convinced enough to abandon their duty and betray their oaths to their Queen. Amaza and several of her key-followers were jailed before they could make their move. In the night before their trial Amaza and her allies were freed by some of her remaining followers in the city guard and their escape turned bloody when forces loyal to the Queen intervened.\nHowever, Amaza and her women managed to escape the city. She now turned to the families who lived in the woods and the women who had abandoned the city after the army had been disbanded in search for new followers. These families had, over the years, taken on the structure of nomadic tribes and carried a strong warrior heritage which made them susceptible to Amaza's teachings. Many of the tribeswomen joined Amaza's forces, and over the weeks and months of her exile further recruits from Carlin arrived.\nPerhaps, given time, Amaza might have eventually led her forces against Carlin. Perhaps with the help of conspirators within the city her forces might have surprised and overcome the Queen's army. However fate had a different end in store for her. She was killed by an orcish arrow in a night ambush. Even today, there is some speculation as to whether this conveniant solution to Carlin's problems was truly an act of fate, or whether the Queen had a hand in Amaza's death. Other theories state that the Thaian King was more concerned about Amaza's cult threatening the status quo in his city than he was happy about the destabilizing effect it was having on Carlin. A final explanation is that the Druid COuncil itself was responsible for her demise. However, there is precious little proof that the orcish arrow was anything more than an unfortunate series of events that in the long run probably prevented a long, drawn out struggle for the people of Carlin.\nHer remaining followers named themselves Amazons in her honour. Though some of them returned to the city, most were too proud for such a move and stayed in the woods. Over the years outcasts from Carlin and desperate or vengeful women joined their ranks. So even when the original group splintered, the several subgroups and tribes managed to survive. Over the years they adopted various codes which can be more or less related to Amaza'S teachings. Those teachings have been passed on by word of mouth and are based on the rather unspecific speeches Amaza made. How much of the current practises of the Amazons is still based on the spirit of their founder is debatable.",

        "text": "The Amazons Vol.2\nHowever, the threat posed by mercenaries loomed over Carlin for some years and the city was never fully able to disband the standing army. The core of the army was formed by the scouts and a city guard. This army was to be reinforced by a highly trained militia in times of need. Through many years, this militia became an effective force, so effective in fact, that as its reputation spread, those soldiers of fortune who may have been tempted to attack a city run by women decided they would be better off seeking their wealth elsewhere. Thus, the need for an army declined, and the cost of maintaining a standing army became too much of a burden for a city which was striving to become a major force in trading.\nThe army was therefore disbanded, and it was expected of the women that they return to their former occupations. This did not please many of them, who felt that they were being cast off and neglected and accused the Queen and her advisors of being short sighted and ignorant of the dangers to their city. When they failed to find support from the Queen they abandoned the city, setting up outposts in the woods to protect the militant way of life to which they had become accustomed.\nSeveral years had passed after the death of Bella Bonecrusher, the valiant warrior who had roused the womenfolk of Carlin to protect themselves against the orcs, when the future direction of the army became a focal point for political conflict within the court of Carlin. Several conflicting groups jostled to influence the Queen in order to follow their own agendas, attempting to manipulate the army, its size, its composition and its aims for the furtherance of their own interests.",

        "text": "The Amazons Vol.1\nWhen Carlin was freed from the shackles of Thaian oppression, the imminent threat of attempts to recapture the city loomed over the weary populace. Some families left the city to hide in the woods. Those who remained immediately began with the construction of fortifications. With the assistance of druids and helpful elves some of the younger women were trained as scouts and roamed the surrounding woods to warn the city in the case of an advancing army.\nHowever, it was at this time unknown to the people of Carlin that Thais was no longer in a position to launch another campaign to recapture the city. With the destruction of its biggest and best legion, the threat of rebellion loomed within the city's walls and advancing monsters at its borders were more than the remaining forces could handle. Still, Thais held on to its claim to the Carlinian lands and tried to incite mercenary bands with bounties to move against Carlin. Unfortunately for Thais, the lawlessness that had overtaken the countryside as a direct result of the conflict between the cities meant that the mercenaries found much more lucrative employment protecting merchant caravans and the homes of wealthy Tibians who chose to live outside the safety of the cities. Further, there was much speculation that the coffers of the Thaian King had been drained in the struggle with Carlin, and the mercenaries severely doubted Thais ability to pay up. However, there were still those mercenaries desperate enough for money, who were unable to find employment protecting trade caravans because their reputations as bandits rather than mercenaries preceded them. This motley bunch readily believed the stories about a defenceless city of weak women whose menfolk had been massacred by raiding orcs. However, these bands of so-called mercenaries were unable to organise themselves into a larger group. Unwilling to share the rewards from such easy pickings, the bands of mercenaries travelling to the North fought each other whenever they met.\nAt the same time as the mercenary bands were fighting each other on their way to the North, the scouts of Carlin encountered the remnants of the orcish invasion force that still roamed the woods. More often than not, the badly organised bands of orcs would be put to the sword and arrow and killed by the scouts. However, the orcs soon grew wise to these attacks and formed themselves into a larger group, posing a significant threat too large to be dealt with by the scouting parties alone.\nIt was Bella Bonecrusher, a young warrior, who saw the potential of the threat and, in a rousing speech, stirred the remaining women of the city to join with the scouts and fight the menace posed by the growing organisation of the orcs. Emissaries were sent to the Elves at Ab'Dendriel to alarm them of the danger that the orcs also posed to their borders. While diplomatic discussions were underway, the newly recruited warriors were armed with equipment salvaged from the battlefields and were hastily trained by the scouts. When the Elven reinforcements arrived in Carlin they were greeted by a ragtag army of untried women. Despite their lack of experience in the battlefield, this army faced the orcs and won against the odds. Soon, the woods were cleared of orcs. Bella Bonecrusher argued that in these troubled times a standing army would be a necessity, others pointed out that everyone was needed to rebuild the city and work on the fields. The discussions turned moot when the scouts reported the advancing war bands of mercenaries from the south. The new army was sent to intercept the advancing forces. The mercenaries, separated in several groups, never high in morale and heavily outnumbered were soundly defeated by the Carlinian forces whose losses were negligible, thanks to the healing magic of the druids.",

Other parts manifested on their own by means so unfathomable, only some book hidden away in that library might tell about.\nMost of what is known about it comes from the scriptures of Zathroth of which many were destroyed in the great purge of the first Inquisition. Other information was gathered from sealed notes the inquisition took in their interrogations. Yet some parts of the compiled information was gained by whisperers in the dark that claimed to be on a mission of enlightenment. Most of what is complied here is old, fractured and incomplete - yet the best available by our means and efforts which were both substantial.\nIt is said that much of the hoard's knowledge was gained by divine insights of Zathroth. Some might just be the ramblings of madmen but still contain disturbing insights. Other parts are even more obscure and can't be reasonably associated with any kind of writer at all.\nMost texts are said to hold the secrets of acquiring more arcane power for oneself - yet to a terrible price. But to the people who ventured that far into the territory of dark knowledge, these prices seem trivial at best.\nSome of the knowledge centers on summoning forth unspeakable things from beyond the known worlds, out of abysses of darkness and madness. Others are supposed to bend elements, space, minds and souls to the will of the user.\nThe accumulated knowledge is immense and twisted to condense and enrich it even more in a way that words can't truly contain it any longer.\nMost books are encrusted with wards and sigils that try to contain as much of the knowledge as possible bound to the volume.\nThe knowledge is still so powerful and potent that it often gained a form of will on its own and maliciously preyed on the minds of the unwary. This knowledge acts like a parasite, draining its bearers soul and mind, whispering misleading and tainted lies, drawing them deeper onto forbidden paths.\nSecrets thought long lost and deceptively easy answers to tantalising questions are bound to lead scholars and mystics alike to treachery and the denouncement of all gods but Zathroth.\nIt is said the hoard is located at a place that 'one time might be' and that 'it is lost to the forever'. It is shrouded by magic, arcane wards, deceptions and ignorance. The key is said to be a state of mind and the lock is ready to break any key that is not strong enough to unlock it.",

        "text": "Tibiantis: Fact and Fiction\nIn the light of progress made my modern science the tales of Tibiantis can be cheerfully disregarded as blatant myths. The author of this questionable history merely drew upon several myths and mixed them together to create a tale plausible to those given to believe such romantic nonsense. The recently discovered, or more accurately, recently rediscovered, city of Yalahar is very obviously a major inspiration for the story of Tibiantis. Aspects of the story can be found in actual fact in Yalahar - the city itself is huge, and also extended its borders beyond the land into the sea, and judging from what can be found there, was most definitely at some point in its past a city that was home to great wonders, whose inhabitants were in possession of great knowledge. However, one of the great mysteries of Yalahar is whether in actual fact those that live there are even human or another race, until recently unknown amongst the Tibian civilisations. The aspect of the story of Tibiantis referring to the downfall of a civilisation could be influenced by many different myths. One such source could be based upon the discoveries made far to the North of Tibia which suggest the possibility of a civilisation that was wiped out by an as yet unknown catastrophe of cataclysmic proportions. Equally, to the extreme south of Tibia can be found the Shattered Isles. These Isles were so named with good reason - geological studies conducted by the Explorers' Society reveal that these isles did not so much sink but were blasted by a phenomenal explosion of some kind. Relics found upon the Isles also hint that they were once populated by a great and most likely advanced civilisation. It is the sad fate of these isles to be the home of the infamous Quara. It is these twisted creatures who probably provide the origin of the myth's fish people. In summary, I believe I have gathered enough proof here to dispell any reason for believing the tale of Tibiantis, and have proven it to be nothing but a conglomeration of ancient stories and legends which an overly ambitious and half informed so-called historian has put together into a new myth of his own making, in order to gain cheap fame by hoodwinking a gullible and uninformed public.",

They were able to retrieve Brian, more dead than alive from the waves. Over the next few days, it became clear that Brian's brush with the lightning had not left him unchanged. His hair was completely statically charged and reacted to any contact with metal with violent sparks of lightning, and any contact with others led to them getting slight electric shocks. Brian reacted rather stoically and refrained from shaving his beard and cutting his hair. The static charge meant that his hair attracted dust - thus giving him the nickname of Dustbeard. When Jolly Jack went into retirement, Dustbeard's characteristic appearance, his golden tongue, his skills as a seaman and liberal amounts of homebrewed alcohol led him to be the natural choice of the crew as captain.\nUpon becoming captain he remembered his old grudge towards his hometown and began to harass the coastal towns of Carlin. When Carlin re-established contact to the town of Svargrond, Dustbeard was there to threaten the new shipping lines. Dustbeard and his men might not be the most skilled pirates but they are known to attack ships against all odds when they are drunk enough. Their unpredictability in battle often gives them the element of surprise, and often their victims are so astonished at the sight of the drunken pirates with their manically haired Captain, that Dustbeard's men more often than not meet with success. It is only a question of time though, before this kind of behaviour will lead to their demise.",

        "text": "Biographies of the Rich and Infamous\nDustbeard the Pirate Vol. 1\nThis is the sensational story behind one of our most notorious pirates, whose hairstyle has sparked a veritable fashion amongst the more rebellious Tibian nobility! It is the story of (who else could it be?) Dustbeard, the infamous and follicly advantaged Pirate! Dustbeard was born under the unassuming name of Brian Eagleston in the City of Carlin. Even in his youth he made a name for himself with the town's authorities, getting involved in brawls in taverns and vandalising public property. He was among the first to be banned from Karl's pub in Carlin. Before he could even grow the beard that was to become his trademark he was involved in the illegal production and trade of alcohol. After some of his customers suffered severe illnesses (hallucinations, memory loss, blindness) he was arrested and sentenced to forced labour in the woods and docks. It was in this milieu that he reinvented himself as a political activist and freedom fighter, demonstrating the skills in leadership and oratory that were to serve him so well in his later career. He convinced his inmates that his trade in alcohol was in fact a form of rebellion. He was not even 20 years of age when he led his fellow prisoners in a revolt in which they captured the ship they had just helped to build and set sail for Thais. Unfortunately, none of his followers were proficient in sailing or navigation, and his first outing as a pirate was doomed to end in failure. The ship was wrecked on a reef while they were trying to reach a village to pilfer food and water. However, he and his men made it to the shore, where they proceeded to relieve the terrified villagers of their food, while faithfully promising that they would be repaid for the loss in due course in the name of the Thaian King. This procedure turned commonplace - he and his crew roamed the wilderness, harassing towns, knowing full well that this questionable course would provoke and bring them into conflict with the authorities, should they ever show up in Thais.\nHowever, this career of pillaging villages and coastal towns was fated to meet an end when he attempted to capture the cargo of a trade ship docked in the harbour of a sleepy coastal town. The Pirate Jolly Jack and his men had beaten them to the town and in the ensuing battle the majority of Brian's men were killed or fled, and Brian, a survivor as always, surrendered. The survivors were given the choice to join Jolly Jack's crew or be left to face the fury of the townsfolk. Of course, Brian and his remaining men chose to join the pirates. The following years saw Brian bloom into a capable seaman and pirate. His popularity amongst his pirate brethren was assured by his skill in brewing alcohol from anything and everything which he could get his hands on. However, it was his brewing skills that once again get him into trouble. A storm struck the ship after a night of particularly heavy drinking from a particularly heavy brew - half of the crew was unconscious and the other half were feeding the fishes. It was on this evening that an air elemental chose to attack the ship. It focused its attacks upon the sails of the ship, hoping to break the mast and drown the drunken sailors. Brian, more drunk than sober, climbed the mast and challenged the elemental fiend. Although it is unlikely that the elemental understood the curses and insults hurled at it by the drunken Brian, it was angered enough to attack him. It left off trying to drown the crew, and focussed instead upon the hapless Brian. It grabbed him and carried him high up into the air, where they were struck by lightning.",

        "text": "The Silent War\nIt is no secret that Thais has always looked to our fair city of Carlin with envious eyes, claiming it as its own. It is also well known that, as the years have proceeded, and Carlin has gone from strength to strength that Thaian claims on Carlin's territory have become nominal, at best. Although the Thaian Royal line and the Thaian nobility are linked with some of the bloodlines of Carlinian families, the times of open hostilities are part of the past, to the benefit of both cities. The only reason that Thais has not discarded its claims on Carlin is merely that such a move on behalf of the royal house would be viewed as weakness.\nBut, I hear you ask, if this is so, why are we still suffering under unfair trade barriers? Why does Thais still use its not inconsiderable political power to hinder Carlin's growth and prosperity?\nThe answer, my fellow Carlinians and concerned merchants, lies in Venore. Reliable sources who do not wish to be named for obvious reasons, who have contact with the highest officials of Thais, have revealed that the Thaian manouvering to infringe our rights and growth originates with the Trade Barons of Venore. The profit motivated Venoreans use their influence, propaganda and wealth to influence decisions made in Thais to the detriment of their greatest competitor - Carlin. Venorean agents are known to hinder Carlin's expansion through any means possible, be it bribery, threats, lies, blackmail or intrigue. Although this maouvering has mainly been covert, the success they have met with is making them more brash and confident and their intrigues are becoming more open and apparent. There is little doubt that they would go to any length to harm us. In fact, Venore is like a spider, waiting to pounce on us should we show any sign of weakness! However, Venore is still too cunning or too cowardly to act openly against our city. Theirs is not the way of open and honourable confrontation, rather, they prefer to let others do their dirty work for them. Thais is merely a tool for them to achieve their devious aims, while we, my friends, concentrate our suspicions upon Thais. By so doing, we are playing directly into their hands!\nThais may still pose the actual threat, but they are not the source of the evil. Should any of you still doubt the truth of my words, then the final, irrefutable proof of the Venorean Trade Barons'ambitions can be seen in the fact that they intentionally undercut our prices, ban our wares from the markets they control and they are the key agents for smuggling contraband into our city, undermining our profit margins and aiding the growth of the black market. It can be assumed that Carlins Girls' Brigade (CGB) has gathered files about Venorean activities and it is a shame that such information is not made public.\nNext issue: The CGB - Has it been Infiltrated?",

        "text": "Marcia Rugby's travels in the north\nMarcia Rugby was the youngest of three daughters of a Trading house in Carlin. Her family was heavily involved in the establishment of a trading outpost at Svargrond before the years of the plague of sea serpents. Marcia was entrusted with the tiresome negotiations with the barbarians of the north. To gain their trust she had to pass the infamous barbarian rite of passage and lived with the shamans on the Isle of Okolnir. Her determination, her iron will and her willingness to adapt and learn their culture duly impressed the barbarians. It was during the time that she spent with the shamans that a growing threat raised its ugly head - the threat of the sea serpents. Although messengers sent by her anxious family reached her in time, informing her that the last ships were about to leave for Carlin, she made the fateful decision to stay with the shamans, in accordance with her agreement with them.\nUpon her return to Svargond the majority of the people from Carlin had left, unwilling to risk getting stranded away from their homes and families. It was apparent that the sea serpents were not a passing threat. Marcia, however, was the daughter of a Trading House, and not one to sit around and wait for fortune to turn. She took her fate into her own hands and continued with her family's aim of setting up the trading outpost, ready for when the sea routes would become safe for ships once more. In order to make her venture a success she decided to explore the icy lands to find out more about the natural resources to be found there and what goods could be traded with the natives. She ventured far and wide, amassing a great deal of knowledge. However, it was during one of her more ambitious forays into the wilderness that she was captured by barbarian raider tribes. Her fluent use of the native tongue which belied her foreign appearance amazed her captors and she managed to negotiate to meet their leader. She was taken before one of the tribe's ice witches. Once more, her considerable skills in negotiation enabled her to convince the witch that she had to see the high ice witch Yakchal herself.\nMarcia so fascinated Yakchal with her stories from different lands and their wonders that she kept her interested enough to not be killed. She even managed to gain her trust enough to live in relative luxury in her captivity. Although it is unclear exactly how many years Marcia was in captivity, she was there long enough for the sea serpents to have been driven from the waters around Svargond. Rumours of the reopening of the trade channels reached Marcia, even in the isolated camp where she was held. In order to escape, she disguised herself as an ice witch and left Yakchal's hideout without rousing suspicion. Her long internment in the camp and her contact with the barbarians had taught her the necessary skills for survival in that unforgiving wilderness and finally she reached Svargond. It was here that she was reunited with her sisters, who had given her up for dead. She left with them to Carlin, but, too long used to a life of travel, she was unable to settle for long before wanderlust overcame her.\nShe decided to set out on an expedition to the Shattered Isles - an expedition from which she never returned. Her family waited in vain for news of her and were left to speculate whether her ship had fallen prey to one of the vicious and sudden storms known to haunt that region, whether it had fallen foul of pirates or whether it had been the victim of a Quara attack. Although the rest of Carlin presumed Marcia dead, her sisters continued to light a candle in Marcia's room, in the hope that she would, one day, return.",

        "text": "The songs of Azaram were numerous and several of them lived on to be still sung in our days. His chivalrous exploits were the base of many modern fairy tales and three of the lections of the art of fighting still bear his name. All the more his fall from grace was more than tragic. It's a bitter and sad tale, recounted numerous times in different ways. Most of this tale still romanticise what has happened. Historical records thankfully give us a more precise picture. In one of his chivalric journeys he met a damsel of incredible beauty. Yet she was engaged to another, much older knight for political reasons. What exactly transpired is still disputed. Though the historical texts give us some plain fact. It cannot be ruled out that his love was indeed the result of a curse of a swamp witch coven. Azaram had certainly participated in several witch-hunts, albeit not in a more active way then his compatriots. It is still possible that he, as a prominent figure was chosen for a curse, to have a greater impact. Also it can't be ruled out, that the damsel in question had a more active and sinister role in the things that transpired. Though the stage play 'The poisoned love of noble Azaram' depicts her as an evil schemer there is little factual evidence to support that claim. Indeed though, she took an unusual road for her travel to her fiance and certainly not in a time that was suited to traveling. But the assumption she orchestrated the attack on her company and the timely rescue by Azaram seems a bit farfetched. For sure it's recorded that he accompanied her on her way from there on. What transpired on their trip together no historian can tell. When they arrived at the home of her fiance, Azaram stayed as honoured guest. When the wedding drew near he was more and more often found in a drunken stupor and susceptible to fits of rage. In the evening before the wedding, the groom took offence of his behaviour and scolded Azaram, reminding him of the knightly virtues. This lead to an outburst of Azaram in which he drew his weapon and swiftly slew his offender. Sobered up by the shock of his own action, he grabbed the maid and forced their way out of the castle, leaving several men at arms dead. The nightly chase lead them to the swamp. Perhaps he wasn't aware where he was riding or perhaps he hoped to lose the pursuers in the marsh under cover of darkness. When the hunters arrived they only saw a gnarled, armoured fist raising from the swamp. when they managed to retrieve the body, OOO was dead. The maid was nowhere to be found, supposedly resting in the swamp for eternity.",

        "text": "The druids of Carlin are closely affiliated to the city and its leadership. From the earliest days of the fledgling city, when the druids helped to provide food and shelter, to the days of prosperity and stability when they offered guidance and healing, they have been a constant in Carlin's history. Because the druids have been rewarded with great respect and considerable influence as a result of their engagement in the city and their decisive role in its success, many druids have moved to Carlin. This has had the consequence that over time, Carlin has become a centre of druidic magic and teaching.\nWhen the looming threat of the Ghostlands was discovered it was the local druids who helped to erect a barrier that warded off the undead and the ghostly inhabitants. The prominence of druidic magic in Carlin has led to somewhat restrained relations with the Sorcerers' Guild that has close ties to Thais as is evident by the funding of the Edron academy. Over the course of time the more rigid guild members of the Sorcerers' Guild withdrew from Carlin and were replaced by freelancers and freethinkers with only loose ties to the Thaian guild so that over the years a form of acceptance between the local guilds was formed. The druids continue to be part of the everyday life of Carlin and heavily influence the culture and philosophy there.",

        "text": "Nargol the impaler was a disgraced knight of an unimportant noble family. Acts of cowardice and drunken violence had cost him any of the little reputation that his birth right and knighthood had given to him. In times of relative peace his attempts as a sellsword yielded too little money to sustain himself. When he had sunk so low as to have sold most of his family arms and armour he started working as a bruiser for local thugs. His fate turned once again, when he became the bodyguard of a spirit speaker. So he accompanied his employer to the court of king Zelos, who was strongly interested in speaking to the spirits from beyond. He was there when the king consulted the spirits with the help of the medium and witnessed some of the plans that took shape in such seances. Seizing the opportunity in a sober moment, he pledged his sword and service to the king, which the latter accepted. King Zelos had only a few loyal allies and some knight, up to anything the king might command, suited him well enough. Even to his own surprise Nargol proved quite effective and efficient in his new role. Soon he became the chief enforcer of Zelos, who soon would become known as the ghost king. For his faithful service to the king's cause, Nargol was awarded with the best weapons and armour available and even magic items found their way into his possession. With an iron fist and without mercy or remorse, Nargol carried out his king's will, in a mockery of true knighthood. The king liked that Nargol acquired a reputation of needless cruelty and violence. Even the threat of a visit of Nargol and his men brought villages and nobles back to the heel. In service of the ghost king the fallen knight took many injuries and was maimed several times. His king though had him stitched together again and again, sometimes replacing or 'enhancing' whole body parts with gruesome, magical substitutes. Over the years he became more and more a thing than a man. A walking magical construct of its own. In the end he seemed almost mindless. Fused with his armour and weapons. Inactive or lost in the dark abysses of his soul unless called to action. When the ghost king finally perished, Nargol simply stopped to 'function'. He was found standing motionless on his horse that strode into a small village. He was rather stored away at a secret place then properly buried, because it was feared he might rise again.",

        "text": "Vlarkorth was a wandering hero even in his youth. Heroic quests lead him all over the world and perhaps even beyond. Sometimes in his travels, while he already was a well-known and established knight, he acquired the secret of eternal youth. It is said that it was granted to him as a wish by fairies whom he had helped. Some whisper he had to sacrifice his own heart to acquire this gift. At least all sources agree that he was a changed man in his later live. While friends of old one by one retired and died, loved ones came and went, he grew more and more bitter and jaded. While he perfected his knightly arts more and more over the decades that passed, his views on knightly virtues became cynical at best. He sought out more and more perilous challenges, as they say out of a death wish. Regardless what fighter or menace he challenged, he went out victorious. He begun to let the more promising opponents live, albeit scarred and disfigured by his hand. It was assumed that this was his way to groom new challengers, to endanger his own live to at least sometimes feel some form of thrill. He antagonized the mighty and had only spite for the just and religious. Yet no challenger could match his skills. He fathered many children over the years and raised them with an iron fist, putting them through rigorous trainings and humiliation. That way he was fostering new generations of opponents that might be worthy one day to give him a challenge at last. At last it was his halve-elven daughter that would be his downfall. While she was a promising fighter he mistreated her like he always did with his children. When she dared to question his attitude once he had her mouth stitched shut. When he held a dashing young adventurer captive in his hold, she rescued him and the two fled. Vlarkorth followed them dispassionately. The hunt was just a mild thrill for him but better than nothing. So he chased them from one end of the world to another. Over the course of their adventures the fleeing pair made new friends and gathered a party of merry men and women. Sometimes Vlarkorth caught up but his prey eluded him in the end, albeit not without casualties. At some point the couple decided they could not run any longer. Alongside their allies they made a last stand and faced the heartless Vlarkorth. In a fierce battle one by one of their companions were wounded or killed. In the end only the halve-even maid and her lover stood against the barely wounded Vlarkorth. It was apparent that they both were no match for the ancient knight. As he was about to kill his daughter, the adventurer impaled himself on Vlarkorth 's weapon and weightened it down. The women, using her refined reflexes to honour his sacrifice, dispatched her ruthless father with a swift blow once and for all. Vlarkorth was buried in shame at a remote place.",

        "text": "Cityguide Venore\nThe city of commerce built its wealth on four major factors. One is the freetrade agreement with the thaian kingdom to which they in theory belong. This ensures trade with all cities, cultures and lands, known or yet to be discovered. Often seen as a separate law but actually part of the free trade agreement is the gambling licence, that is unique in the Thaian Kingdom, because 'commercial' gambling is outlawed since the times of king Yorik I.\nAnother factor is the shipping dock and the woodcutting in the Venore area. Before the Edron colony was established, the Venore area was the major source for wood needed for constrution and tools. What seems odd at the first glance, given the swamp area Venore was built in becomes more understandable when considering the next factor: Until the Druids and mages drove away all those poisonous insects and creatures the area was known for its diseases and a criminal colony in the beginning. So the merchants had a steady supply of cheap workers that had to do every job appointed to.\nThe last factor was the discovery of the Spiceweed. A special swamp grass that was soon used by cooks and households all over the continent.\nSoon enough the merchants became rich and powerfull, rivaling most of Thais noble families in wealth and power.\nFor now the merchants seem content with their station and the place Venore takes on the continent and in the kingdom. There are voices that Venore might separate one day or use it influence to wrest even more rights and privileges from the kingdom that becomes more and more dependent on its economical power.",

        "text": "Puldraks wisdom about orcs\nAs intensely as the orcs hate all other races, they share a feeling of community. The orcs can sense, to some extent, the feelings of other orcs. The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities.",

There role in the war and their fate is yet unclear, but they have few contact with the other elven casts. They are usually a bit taller and stronger than elves of the other races, and there skin is silvery-white or in blue to greenish tones. Their eyes are often pale blue or green, sometimes a faint yellow. They have long black hair, or sometimes dark brown. They seem to live nowadays in the region northwest of Carlin and are seen quite often there. They have the keenest eyes of the elves, and the weapons of their choice are spears, knives and sometimes the short bow. They are fine hunters and sometimes trade furs, but the main part of their life remains yet uncertain.",

As things turned bad for the elves much of their artifacts, artwork and books were brought to theese cities.  Live went on as usual for some time, the elves minding only their own business, as if pretending there was no war at all. Of course the war found them at last. In an frantic attempt to rescue their lives and even their accustomed way of life the elves begun to weave powerfull spells. Many of their best magicians litteraly 'burnt out' in the process but finally the elves succeeded. The whole valley was torn out of the known world ... And this was bitterly needed in a world that was only stormy darkness around the elven valley. They created a artificial light and even created weather. There they lived for hundreds of years, studying and practicing magic, mainly to manipulate and reproduce efects of natue to enhance their lives.",

        "text": "Puldraks wisdom about elves Pt. 3\nThe Teshial were never fighters. They retreated in the early days of war to hidden refuges, not as a whole caste but only in small family groups. Their hideouts were additionally protected by strong illusionary magic and offered them peace from the madness around them. These elves developed due to meditation and a special philosophy in the art of dream magic, dramatically enhancing their initial abilities in the decades. So they began to exist almost permanently in a state of dreams, only rarely appearing now and then amidst the other elves to give them advice and try to convince some of them to join their way of life. As the war grew more and more fierce these visits became less and less frequent until they were almost a myth, even for elvenkind. In the new awakening of the world they were some of the first to appear, apparently far less disoriented then other beings. Many races welcomed their help, but their teachings seldom found dedicated listeners. After they taught a part of their secrets to some humans they found worthy, they had to see their pupils tortured by developments they judged themselves guilty of.  Also, other elves put pressure on the humans to give up the secrets of dreams.  They withdrew from the world of mortals and it is rumored they have physically entered the realm of dreams.\nThe Teshial are 'typical' in appearance for elves, but they could create the illusion of almost any appearance if they so choose. Some people even say that due to their enormous control of dreams they could shape their children as they wish, giving them human or even orcish appearance. On the other hand, even people who come up with such theories go silent when asked why an elf should choose to have a child that looks that way.",

Their families joined each other to travel together for a while, only to disband again soon whenever an area could not supply them all any longer. Hunted by countless enemies and almost everytime outnumbered when it came to fights with 'neighbours' they retreated into the deepest woods where the greater number of their foes was evened out. There they created encampments they visited now and then. They had contact with many creatures and cultures. They adopted ideas and inventions that suited their nomadic lifestyle and begun even a very cautious trade with other races to aquire things they were not able to build on their own. As the attention of the other races turned more and more away from the elves and wars broke out between them, some of the elves begun to live at their up to then only part time ecampment on a permanent base. Adopting what they had seen from other races and things they vaguely remembered from their own past some trading posts were established in this way. Usually only one to three families lived there. After the reunification with the Cenath the majority of them could be convinced to give a permanent settlement a try and the biggest tradingpost became the settlement Ab'Dendriel. Some families refused to join their brethren and continued to wander the world, only visiting the city now and then, each vistit convincing them more that they have only little in common with the  Deraisim anymore. So they begun to see themselves as Abdaisim and continued to be the nomads and restless wanderers of elvenkind.",

Stripped of almost any possesions, they hid in the caves and learned to become very secretive. They had to work very hard, had to fight for almost any goods with nature and ferocious beasts. Most beasts that could live in such livethreatening circumstances were that powerfull that direct attacks proved to be futile. So the elves begun to develop a more devious way to fight, with assaults, traps and hit and run tactics. After over hundred years they had enough resources to leave the burning lands and adopted their way of live to their new enviroment. So they became the secretive people under the hills. They were fierce fighters whenever their new home was threatened. Some hundred years they fought off all intruders until their explorers made contact with the other remaining elven casts. Under the growing pressure of the more and more powerful waves of orcish attacks they left their homes to join forces with the other elves in an uneasy alliance.\nTheir apperance had changed to a even more slender Version of the normal elves. Their skin is very pale, their hair pure white or pitch black. The younger members of that cast often color strands of their hair in unusual clors like red, blue or purple. Red, albinotic eyes are common, but in general all kinds of eyecolors are existent.",

This class of minotaurs was the only one who could live long enough to learn skills not directly connected to war. Since they were almost always the only ones who could gather enough experience and wisdom to create new ideas and concepts, the younger warriors begun to look at them as parents and advisors. Slowly these elders were able to change the war culture of the minotaurs. One charismatic minotaur in particular, Akkor, who was born blind, became the founder of the new minotaurian philosophy. He shunned the rage as a curse of the god Blog.  Consequently, the minotaurian religion, which due to the extremity of martyrdom and rage never had a real chance to develop, turned away from the raging one. Slowly new concepts were adopted and great efforts were undertaken to hold the rage at bay. Meditation and self-control became the foremost duties of any warrior. The minotaurian ideal turned towards role models who were in control of body and mind. Since fiery rage was in minotaurian nature, young minotaurs were trained from early on to control themselves. It was through meditation that the minotaurs developed art and soon philosophy. Complicated ceremonies for usually simple things of daily life were developed to focus the mind, to be aware of each second of life.",

But this rage had cost more than one life and some of the most promising warriors died young on the battlefields. Heavy casualties caused their numbers to decrease dramatically. The minotaurs withdrew from the wars, but in a world gone mad, skirmishes with other races were part of their daily routine. The demise of the whole race continued. As the minotaur race became nearly extinct in the fights, they found refuge in caves, adopting a lifestyle much like their ancient enemies the dwarfs.",

        "text": "There has been recent activity in the local underworld. Nothing close to the usual power struggles but something far more sinister. Old faces are vanishing and new ones are showing up. Old contacts go silent and are either found dead or disappear. Others are in fear. It is hard to peek into the new darkness that enshrouds the crime world. Whatever is happening, it is happening fast and is masterfully executed. There is strong evidence that magic is at work, but certainly no magic your average mage for hire could supply. Experts from the mage gild are in awe of the evidence we have provided. They are sure that this is not guild-sanctioned magic, neither of the sorcerers' nor the druids' guild. And according to them, it is far more refined and powerful than anything some shaman or witch doctor could do. The few people we could interrogate seem to know nothing. They are afraid and confused and receive their orders from a newly established line of command, which we could not follow up very far yet. Strangely enough, crime rates have dropped significantly. But who would actively wrest control from the underworld and then not use it in a meaningful way? This leads to the disturbing conclusion that the recent events aim at something significantly bigger and far more dangerous. We have raised security measures significantly in all areas. We are also trying to re-establish our informant network and get some insight into what is happening at all. I strongly recommend spending more resources into the investigation of this matter and even more into new security measurements, especially in the field of magic.",

The world itself has become old and weary and we will soon begin to feel its death throes. The end is a natural and inevitable thing and those who work to prevent it, work against the natural order. The world has died before and will die again in the future. But each time, out of chaos and destruction it is born anew. This is the way of things. This is how it has to be. Yet, there are forces at work that cling to their power and status. They work to stall the inevitable for their own personal gain and thus, risk breaking the cycle of death and recreation. This is the time for the noble ones to rise to further the end. The few chosen will be there to help the birth of a new world. Know that each world reborn is a better version of the old. This is the way of things and this may not be stopped or tampered with. The chosen who embrace the end and help to bring forth the new world will become exalted amongst all creatures. Those who will carry the burden of birth helpers will carry the mantle of godhood in the world that is to come. Each of them will be rewarded with a status that is appropriate for the effort they put into their fight for rebirth. Those who oppose them will be denied a place in the next world and their essence will dissolve, screaming in the abyss of nothingness. Open your eyes and see the heralds of the end. Follow them and further their work to earn your place. Do not hesitate or falter. For only the dedicated will become the mightiest of gods in the world that is to come. There will be seers, blessed with insights in the needs of the world. Follow their words and orders and you are on your way into the world that is promised. Destruction is inevitable. Embrace it, cast away your fear and lust for worldly possession since fear is futile as worldly things that will be annihilated soon.",

Whereas the gods hold back humanity from reaching their full potential, the hidden lord wants us to prosper and rightfully take our place to rule the world. For too long have we suffered under the claws and teeth of monstrous beings. Given the strength and number of humans, it is obvious that no one could stand against humanity's might. Yet, there they are: the green-skinned, the horned, the one-eyed and all the others. These beasts are only relics of a time gone by but the gods allow them to live on a whim. They care little that humanity suffers under them. How many times will our cities burn and our people be slaughtered until humanity understands that we mean little to the vain gods? The hidden lord has patiently watched the games of the lesser gods and he has given them every chance to see their error. But no longer. The hidden lord will rise and cast down the gods and lead humanity to its destined greatness. He is the one true god and the only one worthy to be worshipped. The imposter gods just took over a world that was perfect and built to be shaped for the arrival of the humans so they would inherit the world as the true god had wished. Instead, the imposter gods used the lesser races that were meant to be the gardeners, miners and workers for humanity and corrupted them into vile beasts that ravaged and destroyed the world. An heirloom for humanity that was never intended for those false gods. The hidden lord, aware of his power, just let them be. In his nearly unending patience, he gave them every chance to turn back and regret their mistakes. But even his patience will come to an end. And the time is near. He will elevate humanity, the crown of creation, to its rightful state. Those humans who were wise enough to see through the deceptions of the deceivers will become his lords and kings in the new world that he is going to shape. He will bless them with his power and wisdom and they will lead humanity into the age of destiny. They will rule and judge in his stead. When the hidden lord will drop his cover, the imposter gods will tremble, the false priests will be smitten and the traitorous rulers will drown in their own blood.",

He put high standards towards others and even higher standards for himself. Almost no one found his approval. There was always some taint or fault that appalled him in human beings. all the more, however, he was appalled by himself. Whereas in others he could only assume the faults and sins, in himself he was well aware of them. His own anger, envy and greed disgusted him to no end. He felt a great evil was growing deep inside of himself. He studied the teachings of the gods and being unable to find a solution he relied on more and more dubious texts and books. Eventually, drawing from elements of different fragmented texts he devised a ritual that would ultimately cleanse him. By this ritual he planned to cast out his malignant side and destroy it once and for all. The preparations took several years and used up all of his fortune. Eventually he was ready and prepared. On the top of a mountain he scribbled ancient symbols, sung in forgotten languages and consumed elixirs of unspeakable ingredients. Three times three days he endured. In the ninth night at midnight a storm engulfed the mountaintop, without touching it. Amidst darkness and lightning from the ashes of the ritual fires a grotesque creature arose. Lord Lokhems evilness had manifested. Yet to his utter horror it was by far more huge and powerful than the puny remnants of his goodness, in a body that was exhausted by the ritual. His evil mocked him, claiming that this outcome had been its plan all along, to finally be set free. Lokhem valiantly tried to fight back by his dark self only toyed with him. Bleeding from countless wounds Lord Lokhem fell to the ground, powerless. He was still alive when he evil claimed his face for himself. Then it mercilessly slew the good side. It left to lead a life of corruption, spreading mayhem where it went. It is said that Lord Lokhems evil side, driven by memories of his research, was searching a secret library that was rumoured to contain vast knowledge. There he planned to find the spell that would free all the evil in humanity at once and give it substance. But he was overwhelmed by the guardians of the library and met his end by their hands. To honor his accomplishment to find them, the guardians granted him a proper burial.",

The godbreaker seems to be some kind of myth amongst demon kind, forbidden lore even to them only to be breathed under the threat of death. It may very well be that the whole story is a lie told to demons to raise their morale, as there is no hint whatsoever to give the stories some form of cogency. The godbreaker, according to demon legends, was created at the dawn of time. It may have been a weapon used by Zathroth to kill Tibiasula, but most sources claim it was created much later, in the most heated phase of the godwars by Zathroth's own raging son, to kill his godly opponents once and for all; but then it was taken away by Zathroth and imbued with incredible enchantments and magics, never dared to be used before or later. It is said that Zathroth himself was amazed and scared by the outcome: a weapon so dreadful that even a god could not look upon it for a longer time. Zathroth ultimately deemed the weapon too strong, particularly fearing that his other half, Uman, might get hold of it and take revenge for the murder of Tibiasula. So Zathroth broke the weapon into numerous parts (most stories claim seven, others name three, four or even thirteen parts). He hid the parts at places so remote and so dangerous they never could be reclaimed by someone other than him. Should the forces of darkness ever have to fear defeat at the hands of their opponents, Zathroth would reforge the godbreaker and vanquish his enemies. Sometimes it is said he entrusted the Ruthless Seven with guarding the parts.\nSome stories even go so far to tell that Zathroth used the broken parts to create the Ruthless Seven with them, and that their unified power might be enough to kill a god.",

        "text": "Theory Of Ascension I\nThe idea of ascension is not one that originated from mankind. Throughout the ages many races have toyed with the idea of ascension, for a number of reasons and with different levels of success. While many human cults argue that it is Banor's godly spark which is in all of humanity that is the key to ascension, the pre-human ascension attempts prove otherwise. Though it may be argued that this godly spark, if it exists at all, might help in an ascension process, it is, depending on the intended course of ascension, no required element. It seems that initial godly energies are inherent to all elements of creation and, as such, could be extracted and concentrated. If such a godly spark in humanity would give humans a head start in ascension, there would have to be more ascended humans than members of other races; but as it is next to impossible to classify or identify an ascended being this is still up for debate. For instance, it can't be verified if the so-called gods of the elves truly exist and if they do, whether they truly were living beings once. It becomes even more obscure in the case of vanished races or those hostile to humanity, where little verifiable information is available.\nAnother fact complicating the matter is that as numerous as the paths to ascension are, as numerous are the results. As far as humanity can tell, the major gods have been around since the time of creation. There were no additions to their ranks at all. This would leave ascendant beings with only little spheres of influence and question their success altogether. But as we are not familiar with the structure of ascendant beings in general, it is hard to make a qualified statement about their doings at all. As we don't feel the hand of the accepted gods in our daily lives, it might be possible that this is even truer for ascendant beings, and their influence might be extremely subtle. In addition, it is hard to tell if ascension something that immediately sets in. It is entirely possible that ascension makes it necessary to accustom to a new existence and to only gradually tap into the acquired powers. So all we have to work with are claims of ascension or apocryphal texts that might hint at one. Unless we find means to verify an ascended status, it is futile to concentrate any scientific research on this topic. All we can do is to look into the theories and means to achieve an assumed ascension. It is universally agreed in any ascension theory encountered that the most integral (yet not necessarily the first) step is the acquirement of enormous amounts of energy. What kind of energy is needed is already up to debate. Most theories base on the belief that it is a spiritual energy which has to be acquired. How it could be gathered and contained is of course nothing different schools can agree upon. Regardless of this fact, the amount of energy itself has to be enormous.\nThough it doesn't seem to be based on any real data, many ascensionists agree upon the fact that not everyone can ascend, but the individual has to be 'awakened'. This universal term has a variety of meanings in the different theories, however. Usually it is connected to some magic ability, where chances of success relate to the raw magic power someone commands. This implies that great mages are the most likely to succeed in ascension.",

        "text": "Theory Of Ascension II\nAnother school of thought introduced the interesting concept that an ascended being must have some sort of anchor in the material world. Following this theory, an ascended being would enter a new kind of existence so different from what it experienced in life that at first, it would be extremely disoriented and confused, drifting through a sphere of gods and losing contact to creation in the limitless realm, before regaining its senses. However, as with all parts of ascension theories, the structure of such an anchor is hotly debated. Many see the beliefs of people as some sort of anchor, additionally providing some source of constant energy. Some go so far as to postulate that even the gods of creation might need such an anchor, lest they'd drift literally into obscurity. Others claim that the gods are bound to their creation and the part that they incorporate and do not need of other anchors, reasoning that in the beginning there was no one who could have believed in them to begin with. Though many texts assume a quite a rather fast, violent and critical process, others see this kind of transcendence as a gradual process which requires a lot of time but happens in a more natural way. If truly some of the bygone races managed ascension, the lack or loss of their anchor might explain their apparent absence from the affairs of modern mankind.\nAnother part, many of the schools agree upon, is the initial breakthrough. It is assumed that an ascending being has to somehow breach the walls that separate the world of the living from the realm of the gods. Sometimes this act is compared to a bird, hatching from an egg.\nWith the three parts in place we have a rough concept of ascension: the energy, the anchor and the transcendence.\nQuite a lot of the recorded attempts of ascension followed this basic concept. Though most seem to be based on a religion forming around the ascensionist, this might only seem to be so because such incidents are better recorded and more obvious.\nThe few recorded attempts of ascension seem to suggest that the ascensionist, shortly before starting the process, is at the height of his worldly power. At a given point of ascension those beings (who met some form of success) are beyond the powers available to man. Walking gods in their own right, they are no longer fully part of creation and seem less bound to its laws. In the process of transcendence, the entity is extremely powerful but not fully aware of its potential and partly distracted by the ascension itself. This is the moment when the process is in its most fragile state. It is at that stage when most attempts fail, sometimes with catastrophic consequences, depending on the chosen means of ascending.\nThough no successful ascension has been verified by science, it is strongly assumed that some ascensionists met with success. Considering that the outcome is likely to be affected by the means of achieving ascension, it is probably only a matter of time until a rather violent and active new god emerges who shuns the subtlety of his predecessors.",

        "text": "\"Still it is hard to believe that I finally found the mystical rock formations near Darashia, known as Lion's Rock. According to ancient records there is a temple for an unknown, probably long forgotten deity, built in the tunnels deep below the rock centuries ago. This holy site was once guarded by mystical lions and they may still be down there. But yet I haven't succeeded in entering the inner sanctum. The entrance to the lower temple areas is protected by an old and powerful enchantment. I studied the inscriptions on the temple walls and thus learned that the key to the inner sanctum is the passing of three tests. The first test is the Lion's Strength. In order to honour the site's mystical cats of prey one has to hunt and slay a cobra. The cobra's tongue must be laid down at a stone statue as a sacrifice. The second test is the Lion's Beauty. One has to burn the petals of a lion's mane flower on a coal basin. In the sand at the rock's foot I saw some dried lion's mane petals. Maybe these flowers grow somewhere upwards. The third test is called the Lion's Tears. It seems one has to purify an ornamented stone pedestal with ...\" At this point the records end because the parchment is destroyed.

Being little stronger than a rat, bats are rather a nuisance than a threat to an experienced adventurer. Their attacks on humans mainly happen out of self-defence. Bats often form a large swarm which is slightly more dangerous to face than a single specimen. Bats can be found almost everywhere as long as there is some close-by dark place where they can breed and sleep.\nThe rat - Whether humans brought this pest with them on the isle or whether rats are indigenous to every dark place in Tibia is anyone's guess.

        "text": "MONSTERS AND FOES OF DAWNPORT IV\nCreatures of the meadows and marshes\nThe dawnfly - A close relative of the emerald damselfly found in the swamps of Venore, it is supposed the creature may have found its way over the seas to Dawnport and adapted to the isle. Like the damselfly, their diet consists of plant matter and smaller insects though they too attack passersby, supposedly to guard their territory. Their bite is slightly poisonous, but poses a threat only to the wounded or completely unprepared wanderer.\nThe woodling - The woodlings could be the missing link between the swamplings and the haunted treelings. Half plant and half animal and at least partially intelligent, treelings love to ambush their prey and make use of the surroundings to drive it into a corner. Looking deceptively tree-like, a woodling will make a grab at any human that passes; supposedly to spice up its diet of rotting leaves and plants with something more juicy. Woodlings can slow down their enemies and are quite tough, which is why any inexperienced adventurer would do well to know the way back to the outpost in a hurry if venturing down to the woody plains.\nThe Meadow strider - A giant bird that stalks the marshes and meadows, the meadow strider usually feeds on small insects and amphibians. Being very territorial but short-sighted, it will attack any supposed rival of its own size, which includes humans, and peck at them. Though they are nearly as tough as woodlings, there's good eating on a meadow strider, and they often contain swallowed gold coins and other useful stuff.",

Often they are the hunters and not the hunted. It is a good decision to engage them in combat only with decent equipment and to fight a wolf one on one. If there's nothing else, you can always eat a hunch of wolf, and sell its fur.\nThe bear - Bears are hard to beat! Keep that in mind before challenging one. If you are inexperienced and don't have good equipment, retreat is the tactic of choice. Best kill bears in small hunting parties and use terrain to your advantage.\nThe deer - Deers are a fine supply for food and are non-agressive animals and try to flee on sight. It might be difficult to catch them and you might easily enter the territory of a local predator while chasing them.\nThe hare - Like deers, hares will flee upon sight and are an excellent source of food for any passing adventurer. They are a common sight in the meadows and forests of Tibia, though larger predators are never very far.\nThe squirrel - Swift and impish, squirrels will run from any human they see. Hunters avoid preying on squirrels, as there is a legend that says that the giant immortal Squirrels who ate nuts from Crunor's blessed tree take bloody revenge on each and every killer of their descendants. Squirrels are found in woody areas all over Tibia.",

        "text": "Genesis I. The Awakening of the Gods\nIn the beginning there was only a big, gaping void. It was everywhere and nowhere.\nIn this emptiness two powerful entities appeared who were eventually known as the elder gods: Fardos the Creator and Uman Zathroth who combined in himself two unequal halves. One of these halves was Uman the Wise, a benign god who was gifted with divine intellect, while Zathroth the Destroyer was the other, darker half. These were the two halves of one single enigmatical entity, and even though either of them was perfectly capable of acting on his own just as if he had been fully independent, independent they were not. They were bound together by an eternal bond that could not be broken, and their destiny was one.\nNobody knows where the elder gods came from, or whether they had always existed and eventually awoke from the slumber of infinity. But somewhere along the way they decided to create a universe. Surely Fardos was the initiator, for he was driven by the need to create and give life. He was overflowing with creative power and impatient to release it, so he stepped into existence and began to unleash his powers. However, none of his attempts to create were successful. All of his creations were swallowed by the void before they were completed, and none survived.\nUman Zathroth regarded Fardos's undertakings thoughtfully. Uman was sagacious and held awesome magical powers. Most importantly, however, he was driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge and enlightenment. In his essence he resembled Fardos, but where Fardos worked openly and logically, Uman's domain was the realm of mystery. Still, he shared Fardos's interest in creation, whereas his dark half Zathroth was essentially corruptive. Zathroth was a vain god who was painfully aware that his own creative powers were poor. Because of this he looked at Fardos's work of creation with jealousy, and from the very beginning he was determined to prevent or at least corrupt it in any way he could. Fardos, who did not suspect this, asked him for assistance because he had accepted the fact that he could not achieve creation on his own, but of course Zathroth denied. Uman, however, agreed to help. And from that he and Fardos worked together on the great project that was creation.\nUnfortunately, their combined efforts were hardly more successful. Just like before, everything Fardos and Uman created was swallowed by the void as soon as it came into existence, and the two gods sadly saw their creation run through their fingers like water through a sieve. On the other hand, Zathroth, who had been watching their efforts with suspicion, rejoiced. He ridiculed their efforts. However, his glee changed into surprise and anger when he found that something strange happened, something which perhaps Uman and Fardos did not expect themselves. To this day, nobody knows precisely what it was that caused it. Perhaps the power that had been spent lured another entity out of the void, or it might be that it simply awoke another divine entity from its slumber. Some even claim that in some mysterious way the power that had been spent by Uman and Fardos actually created a new entity. Whatever the truth may be, a new goddess stepped out of the void like a new-born mermaid from her shell. The amazed elder gods watched her divine beauty in awed admiration, for everything in her was perfect harmony. They agreed to call her Tibiasula. Zathroth, however, stood by and fumed with silent hate. But cunning as he was, he hid his resentment well and feigned to share the joy of the other elder gods.",

        "text": "Genesis IV. The First Creatures\nZathroth watched the progress of creation with wrath and disgust. If he had had his way, he would have obliterated creation then and there. However, he knew that he lacked the power to do that, especially since Fardos and Uman were now well aware of his intentions and watched him carefully. He would have to resort to other means to bring ruin to creation. It was for this reason that he watched the concept of life with great interest, because he foresaw quite clearly that a lot of mischief could be done with it. Much as he loathed most of the gods that had been created, there was one who had caught his attention. Fafnar's base instincts and her destructive powers did not fail to impress him, and so a plan came to his mind. He flattered her with compliments and before long he succeeded in seducing her. Thus Brog the Raging Titan was conceived. An exceedingly ugly abomination that had only one eye in its huge head, Brog had inherited little of his father's cunning and none of his caution, yet he was strong and fierce, and his mother's furious heat burned wildly inside him.\nAs he grew up, Brog was pained by the fire burning inside him, until one day when it grew unbearable he summoned all his magical powers and released as much of the painful flame into the world as he could. The searing fire mixed with his rage, and from it rose Garsharak, the very first dragon, who later sired a whole race of intelligent, giant lizards, a race that would eventually bring terror and chaos into Tibia. Brog watched the terrible creature he had created rather accidentally, and he rejoiced when he saw just how fierce and powerful it was. Though he was rather stupid he, too, had the gift to create life, which in an act of vanity he next used to create the cyclopes in his own image.\nZathroth watched Brog's experiments with great interest. So far he had not held his son in high esteem, but here was something for which he himself admittedly had little talent for. Since he did not understand the laws of life himself he knew that Brog's gift could prove to be a great asset. He called his son to him and told him to go on with his experiments, urging him to create something more terrifying and destructive than cyclopes. Even though these giants were ferocious and strong, they were not quite as destructive as he wanted them to be. In fact, due to their love of mining and smithing the cyclopes were a creative rather than a destructive race. Worse, they were not propagating fast enough to make them a real threat to creation. For this reason Brog went on to create trolls and goblins, races that were weaker than the cyclopes, but propagated much faster. However, his undisputed masterpiece were the orcs, a race of fearsome, single-minded warriors who lived only to expand and conquer. Soon they had spread all over Tibia, and they were the scourge of all that was alive.",

In the wars over creation they were one of the most successful races. But as the war grew more and more fierce it were the wild and raging minotaurs that had to pay the worst blood toll. The berserker rage inherent to their race made them a formidable opponent but also very vulnerable.\nThough victorious in most battles, in the end the berserking warriors had to surrender to their wounds or were left crippled and executed and fed to Blogs lesser followers. Even worse, the raging minotaurs knew neither friend nor enemy. Brother slew brother, fathers slaughtered their sons in their rage. Then, one day a minotaur, named Tha'kull conquered his rage. He withdrew from battle and became a hermit. In his travels he met Akkor, the blind one. This minotaur was by fate not subjected to the rage inherent to the minotauren race and had aquired a tranquility and wisdom, unknown to his kind so far. Tha'Kull thaught the blind one how to improve his body and fortitude and Akkor in return teached the warrior how to improve his soul.\nHe looked upon the world and for the first time in aeons a minotaurean warrior saw the world without hatred. He saw the beauty in things, simple and complex. He saw the harmony in creation and the place the living had in it. He also saw the place that was meant to be taken by the sentient beings among the living. And he went back to his people to teach. Never a warrior of the minotaurs had neglected his rage and even though he was cautious the angry berserker warlords would not allow the words he spoke to be heard by their people.",

Orcs have speech and are capable to learn other humanoids language quite well ... if they want, what almost never is the case. They lack a written language though. Some of the more educated orcs use human letters to write down orcish texts. Its rumored that the orcs we encounter now and then are just barbarians of their own kind and that there is a more 'civilized' orcish culture somewhere. There are some clues that the orcs indeed had a written language, but the modern orcs is unable to read it as we are.",

        "text": "Finally, Banor again turned to the gods to help him, and they answered his prayers. Again it was the ever-resourceful Uman who had found a solution, a solution that was possible because he had made the most amazing discovery: He had found that beyond the very fabric of existence there were other dimensions, far-away planes in which even the elder gods held no power. However, Uman had found a way to establish a connection to these alternative planes of existence, and after much experimentation he had learned that it was possible to conjure souls of living creatures from these planes. When brought to Tibia these souls could be turned into human shape, forming the champions the human race desperately needed. This, then, was the answer to the human's problems, and it was swiftly put into practice. The gods planted a number of magical gates on Tibia, gates that were soon referred to as Portals of Souls. Through these gates a steady flow of heroes came into the world, human warriors that were both cunning and brave, and with the aid of these champions the abominable hordes were slowly but surely pushed back. At the long last it looked as though the order would be restored. Things looked brighter for the human race than they had done in a long time. The allied powers of heroes and humans advanced further and further into the enemy's territory, and the dark hordes seemed to stand on the verge of utter defeat. But alas! Those who believed that the old races would now be wiped from the face of Tibia for good were a little hasty, because something unexpected happened. Faced with the seemingly overwhelming might of the human armies the old races did what for aeons had been unthinkable: They signed a truce. Dragons, orcs, undead and all those other races that had fought amongst themselves for so long suddenly stopped attacking each other and concentrated on their war against the human race. And so it came to pass that again things took a turn for the worse. Even though their enemies did not trust each other enough to form any alliance worth mentioning, the sheer fact that they stopped fighting amongst each other brought the human race into a very precarious position. Soon their advance was brought to halt, and once more they were forced onto the defensive. The human armies decided to withdraw to their fortified cities to resume the war there, but again they made a surprising discovery. For this time, the very first time in recorded history, the enemies of the humans did not rush after them to take up the fight. Many were puzzled by this, as it was not readily apparent why the hordes acted this way. A common theory was the tensions and the mutual distrust between the old races was too strong for them to combine their forces in a sustained campaign, and some even claimed that they had started waging war against each other once more. Others suggested that the old races had exhausted themselves in the course of the many wars, while still others hinted that perhaps an equilibrium had been reached, a status quo which all sides felt they could live with. Whatever the reason, a period of restless but fundamentally stable peace ensued, and it lasts to this day. For the very first time the troubled world has a reprieve from the ceaseless slaughter which troubled it for aeons.

He felt that Zathroth had finally gone too far. In his desperation he turned to Fardos for advice. Together, they decided that it would be best to sever the bond between Uman and Zathroth once and for all. They set about to this task with great energy, and their efforts soon enough appeared to be crowned with success. However, the weaker the bond between Uman and Zathroth became, the weaker Uman himself grew, and in the end they realised that the duality could not be separated without endangering Uman's very existence. At last the invocation was aborted. Uman had to accept the fact that the duality between Zathroth and himself could not be broken, and that their fate and indeed their very existence were intertwined for eternity.\nHowever, Uman's and Fardos's joint efforts did not remain entirely without consequence, for during the unsuccessful attempt to separate the double god a small part broke away from it. This tiny shard grew and expanded until it took shape and eventually became a sentient creature of its own. This was the hour Kirok the Mad was born. Owing to his peculiar ancestry this strange god has a twisted or, as some say, a schizophrenic nature. He inherited Uman's creative mind and his inquisitive nature, so that he eventually became the patron god of all those who follow the path of science and research. However, the one trait Kirok is really famous for is his twisted sense of humour. He adores bad taste and ingenious pranks, and this peculiar characteristic makes him the favourite of bards, jesters and of all other kinds of suspicious people.\nWhile Fardos and Uman were working hard on their spell, Zathroth's minions went on to lay waste to the elder gods' precious creation, and the devastation continued without pause. It seemed as though the whole world was doomed to perish. However, some of the lesser gods who were tired of just standing by while their beloved Tibia was ravaged. They decided to put up resistance against the reckless hordes. Bastesh the Mistress of the Sea created huge, mysterious creatures that were both elegant and fierce, and she populated her beloved ocean with them to make sure Zathroth's minions would never defile its pure waters. However, there was little she could do to help her cousins who lived on the dry land. Of all her creatures the only ones to survive on land were the dextrous and venomous snakes. Crunor and Nornur, too, created creatures to fight against Brog's and Zathroth's hordes: Crunor the Lord of the Trees created fierce wolves, while Nornur equipped his beloved spiders with deadly poison to make them more powerful.",

        "text": "V.i Part 2: The Age of Chaos\nHowever, for all their efforts, the gods could not create creatures that were a match for the ruthless, well-organised hordes that roamed the land. The wolves' hides and the spiders chitinous exoskeletons could not resist the steel of the orcish blades, and for every troll that was brought down by poison two others came to take his place. In the end gods' children withdrew to areas that were easy to defend: The wolves fled into the depths of the forests, while the spiders hid deep in caves. There they continued their fights, defending their realms against the onslaught of the superior enemy. These little pockets of resistance were the only sanctuaries in a world that sank deeper and deeper into chaos. And the worst was yet to come, for now the dragons felt the time had come to take what was theirs by right!\nFor centuries they had propagated and expanded in silence, largely unnoticed by all other creatures. But now that Garsharak, the very first and strongest of their race, sent them into the world they knew neither restraint nor mercy. The orcish armies were routed by the relentless flames of magical dragon fire, and soon that proud though barbaric race, who until then had not known the meaning of the word defeat, was driven into the shelter of subterranean settlements. Their allies, the mighty cyclopes, fared no better. Although they won a number of notable victories using their powerful weapons and armour, they, too, had to yield to the superior power of the dreaded dragons. They joined their former allies, the orcs, and their weak cousins, the trolls, in their subterranean exile. Their proud cities that had been built in the course of centuries were burnt down to the ground, and their renowned forges were lost forever.\nThus the dragons had taken over the rule of the land, but the war was by no means over. Their bitter enemies, cyclopes and orcs, resented what they felt was an imprisonment in the bowels of the earth, and they continued the fight from their subterranean hideouts. And in fact the dragons, who had already been weakened in the course of the previous battles, suffered serious losses. But now war also erupted among the former allies, as cyclopes and orcs competed for food and space in their subterranean abodes. And even though no side was strong enough to overcome the others the war went on with undiminished force, and all of the races suffered greatly in the epic struggle. The land was scattered with bodies, and while it seemed that life itself would be wiped from the face of Tibia the losses of all races that were involved daily grew in number. It was as if the living would drown in the bodies of the slain.",

        "text": "V. ii, The Age of Chaos\nThe elder gods watched as the cataclysmic battle went on. They felt no pity for those that were slain because they cared little for Zathroth's creatures, but they knew that something was missing, that somebody was needed to take care of the bodies and souls of those who ceased to live. They began to look for a solution, and finally Uman proposed that a new god should be created, a god who should see to it that the dead would be taken care of. They decided that earth, which in a way was the giver of life, should have a part in taking it back, and that Uman should be the newly created god's father. But alas! The elder gods were not as cautious as they should have been, and so Zathroth the Destroyer learnt about their plans all too soon. He was fascinated by the idea of death from the start, because he saw in it a new chance to bring further havoc and destruction into the world. Soon he had devised a vicious plan. He posed as his good half Uman to fool earth, and with it he sired another god: Urgith the Master of the Undead. This hideous deity was devoted to death just like the god Uman and Fardos had in mind, but he was not the benign guardian of the dead they had envisioned. Instead, Urgith was a cruel god who strove to infuse the bodies of the dead with unholy energy, dooming them to a state that was neither life nor death. Thus, the hour of Urgith's birth marked the beginning of undeath.\nSoon enough innumerable undead roamed the world. After all, Tibia was still covered by countless bodies of slain orcs, cyclopes and other creatures - the legacy of the many years of ceaseless war. These cadavers provided Urgith with the ideal recruitment pool, and he eagerly transformed all carcasses he could lay his hands into his gruesome servants. The gods watched in horror as a new scourge ravaged their beloved creation. They hurried to finally put their own initial plan into practice, and Uman united with earth in order to sire Toth the Warden of the Souls. It was to be his mission to safely guide the souls of the dead to the otherworld, where they would safely rest in the peace of an eternal dreamless slumber, while the worms, his faithful servants, swarmed out to devour their bodies that scattered the face of Tibia. But the damage had been done, and even though Toth and his servants did the best they could Urgith's ghastly creations continued to roam the land. All the other creatures, who were already greatly weakened by their endless wars, could put up little resistance to the new enemy who increased in strength with every loss they suffered. It looked as if Tibia was forever doomed to be a world that was inhabited by the living dead.\nThe elder gods looked at what had happened to their world, and their hearts filled with sorrow and resentment. They knew that if they did not act now Tibia would be destined to become a grave, and so they started looking for a solution. Eventually they agreed to try to create a sentient race of their own, a race that would be strong enough to take up the fight against the hordes that ravaged their beloved world. And so they created a race and sent it into Tibia. But alas! Urgith's minions were too strong. Their race was defeated within a generation, and it was wiped from the face of Tibia. So Uman and Fardos created race after race, and race after race was overwhelmed by the vicious abominations that Urgith had released into the world. Most of these races disappeared from the face of Tibia forever, leaving little but melancholy legends and mysterious ruins. Today, this sad era which is commonly known as the Corpse War is largely shrouded in mystery, and the unfortunate races that were destroyed in it are now referred to as the ancients.",

        "text": "V. iii, The Age of Chaos\nHowever, not all of the ancients were eradicated in the fierce struggle. At least two of the races created by the elder gods in the course of this epic struggle somehow managed to escape destruction and to survive until today. One of them was the elves, delicate creatures who could handle bows and musical instruments with equal skill. The other was the dwarfs, a stout race of gifted miners and smiths. Both of these races fought bravely, but both of them had to yield to the vicious power of their enemies, and it was only by fleeing into safe places of refuge that they managed to survive. The elves after many hardships sought shelter in the unfathomable depths of the forests, while the dwarfs barricaded themselves in their impenetrable fortresses deep in Tibia's mountains. There, these races waited for better times, bitterly deploring the cruel fate that had sent them into this dreadful world. But at least they had survived. All the other ancient races were seemingly sentenced to oblivion, although it is occasionally claimed that there are other survivors.\nFor all their strength, these races had one important flaw in common: They lacked flexibility. And this proved to be fatal in the war against the relentless enemy they were facing. Those who were not annihilated succumbed to Zathroth's temptations. More than one of the ancients fell for Zathroth's cunning promises of power and knowledge, and legend has it that the wrathful elder gods brutally punished many of them for their treachery. There is even a persistent theory that some of these ancients later on were formed by the devious Zathroth into the very first demons. Be that as it may, all the ancients failed to live up to their creators' expectations: One by one they were overwhelmed by the enemy, and still the hordes walked the world. But the elder gods had learnt from their mistakes. Their next creation was to be well suited for the task. And they called them the humans.",

Some ancient creatures were possessed of a far-reaching will to conquer and subdue all others through their thoughts alone, while the newer beings could weave magic in defense or had strength and swiftness to defend and escape the wiles laid out to ensnare them. Some animals and plants, simple though they may seem to us, yet are deadly poisonous in order to ward off their hunter.\nBut only the more intelligent beings - and of those, only a select few - possess the art of making powerful concoctions that enhance their faculties.\nThe humble woodman or wanderer will never be able to fulfil the complex rites, or even grasp the concept, of the trimagical umbralistic principle of the equinox formula that is crucial to the craft of magical potions.\nBut still, they can drink, and appreciate, the brews we make to keep a warrior's body alive in a fight, the mage's mana when drained, the paladin's spirit when they need to gather holy force. ...

They knew that if they did not act now Tibia would be destined to become a grave, and so they started looking for a solution. Eventually they agreed to try to create a sentient race of their own, a race that would be strong enough to take up the fight against the hordes that ravaged their beloved world. And so they created a race and sent it into Tibia. But alas! Urgith's minions were too strong. Their race was defeated within a generation, and it was wiped from the face of Tibia. So Uman and Fardos created race after race, and race after race was overwhelmed by the vicious abominations that Urgith had released into the world. Most of these races disappeared from the face of Tibia forever, leaving little but melancholy legends and mysterious ruins. Today, this sad era which is commonly known as the Corpse War is largely shrouded in mystery, and the unfortunate races that were destroyed in it are now referred to as the Ancients.\n...",

Some of them manage to stay in the world of the living as some form of ghost or undead, but most of them simply move on to the afterlife. But even there, some of them simply don't give up. And as there is little in the world as persistent and diligent as a bad entertainer, many of them stay at the border between the two realms and contemplate their ill fates. They mourn the fame they never acquired and which they feel was unjustly stolen from them. They partner with similar minded individuals and complain to each other how cruel the world has treated them. Of course none of them is actually listening to each other because they are too absorbed with their own misery. So they grow louder and louder and over the course of time, their monologues are heard everywhere in the plain of death.\nSadly, one of the things even more persistent and diligent as a bad entertainer is a whole bunch of them. In the end, they grow that loud and annoying that the guardians of the gates of death themselves lose their patience. So once a year they throw the annoying fools out and banish them to the realm of the living, knowing that they would not stay there for long given their annoying nature.\nSo once a year hordes of undead jesters raid the cities where they once were seeking fame and glory. As undead, they try to terrorise the living, however, as they are even worse as undead than they are as entertainers they pose only a minor threat. Usually they find themselves back in the afterworld quite soon, and for another year, they dream of greatness that was never theirs.",

This network seems to have been some kind of communication device and knowledge storage. Almost like a library, the Shapers had access to it as long as they were close enough to certain transmitting towers. At the height of the Shapers' power those towers must have dotted the whole world. The Shapers became not only highly dependent on this network but also highly addicted to it. Even more, most of their communication was handled via this network. When it was destroyed, the single Shaper was overwhelmed by loneliness and lack of information. Moreover, they had lost the ability to teach younger generations without using their network. It was reported that some Shapers that found refuge by other non-hostile races became passive and depressed, sometimes they even refused to drink or to eat. This explains the swift vanishing of the race.

To reach the hoard is to unify the greatest and most complex secrets of the world. It means to understand them in such a natural way they can be weaved into a universal pattern that allows understanding the inner workings of the world. This would be an amount of knowledge that could only be called 'godly'. Of course no mortal being could reach such a level of understanding. The followers of this path strife for it nonetheless. This knowledge is by definition only limited, a mere stepping stone to the next level of understanding on a never ending staircase. The assumption that a hoard would actually need a physical representation of knowledge on the other hand, seems rather blasphemous. Why would a god need books and why would a god of secret knowledge risk to accumulate all forbidden knowledge at one place I ask? The story about Zathroth's hoard of knowledge is just that, a story.

Well, life is sex too, but this is a book for little children, so we won't talk about that here. But never forget that magic is a jealous lady, and if you try to get her out of your head she will be sure to take revenge.\nThe first thing you must know about the Noble Art of Magic is that not all Tibian inhabitants or monsters of the underworld have the exact same way with magic. Only the civilised people who live on this world have the same magic style, no matter their race: humans, the elves in Ab'Dendriel the Beautiful and even the dwarfs in their underearth city, Kazordoon. There is only one spot that is completely isolated from magic in the whole world, and that is the island known as Rookgaard, where no magic can be cast - perhaps some Dark Ritual made it impossible, who knows.\nIn the civilised world, not all have the same skill with or amount of magic power, commonly known as 'mana', but this will be explained in the next book.",

        "text": "Knightly Successor Orders of Tibia, loose pages I\nAn abridged version of a book concerning knightly orders by former knights of King Xenom, father of King Tibianus.\nIn the first year of the young King's rule, the siblings Oberon, Kesar and Scarlet Etzel fell out with each other. Their quarrel over knighthood under their king and the search for more purpose in their knightly duties drove them far away from Edron. Each of them founded a seclusive order but little is known about their paths during the following years. This book tries to summarise all facts known to Tibian historians as of this day.\n(the book goes on about the orders and their founding figures, some specific passages draw your attention)\nThe leader of the Order of the Falcon (Oberon Etzel) was the first to found his own order. He saw himself and his men as true successors of King Xenom. Dismay over the King's opinions and politics led the dedicated knight to build a new order. On the foundations of law, extreme loyalty and dedication to chivalric virtues, the Order of the Falcon was established, not least as a strong signal in King Xenom's direction. Oberon Etzel's following was devout and dedicated to an extreme. Tolerated by the King at first in honour of the knight's former service, they were soon sidelined and ultimately their decisions were seen as those of of outsiders. Soon, the notion \"Trapped Falcons\" or \"Falcon Cage\" (referring to their Edron stronghold) was shaped by nobles and common folk alike. It is widely assumed among historians that these circumstances led to a self-imposed exile by the angered Oberon Etzel.\n(the book also contains excerpts from an Edron report of the assumed dissolution and exile of the Order of the Falcon, commissioned by the late king Xenom himself)\n(...) Among a multitude of other questions, stemming from the seclusive and secretive nature of the successor order, what makes this case most interesting in historical debates is the seemingly immediate disappearance of Oberon Etzel and his knights. The stronghold was reportedly abandoned over night with no trace of the order itself or any hints concerning their whereabouts. Eyewitnesses confirmed vibrant lights and unnerving sounds originating from the top of the stronghold during many nights. Not many dared venture close enough to the perimeter to catch a glimpse of what really happened there. Reports are varied and inconsistent. Apparently lights were also seen in the night before the one that marked the disappearance of the honourable order. It is worth mentioning that the order hosted several guests and workers almost all the time. Despite their dispute with the king and the other Etzel siblings, the order was generally considered honourable and trust-worthy. No notable suspicions have been raised during the time and until the disappearance there have been no noteworthy incidents. The disappearance seems to be connected to several high ranking officials from various cities which have been reported as missing during or around the time in question. Aside from various personally delivered invitations, no real connections could be made. (...)",

It is rumored that Kesar believed the mythical lions to hold the key to true chivalric virtue. However, there have not been any pilgrims of the Order of the Lion for many years. (...)

Reportedly he not only had a dispute with the King, he also fell out with the leader of the Order of the Falcon, Oberon, over how to guide the now exiled orders into a righteous future. While Kesar wanted to protect the known world from dark forces, Oberon was determined to explore foreign lands and discover more of the world, the knights swore to give their lives for. Traveling into the unknown and uncovering evil whereever its roots may be, was a prime goal for Oberon and the Order of the Falcon. Oberon was stubborn and impossible to control, even for his elder brother. Their sister Scarlett would not have any of this and neglected both her brothers ways. She had confidence in her knights, especially her strategist and loyal companion Galthen and wanted to go her own way after leaving Edron. Yet even she would have liked to see Kesar and Oberon to burry their differences and instead join in their endeavours. A consent was never reached, Kesar was the first to leave Edron and King Xenom behind. He avoided Oberon but remained in contact with Scarlett for a few years.\n(someone has scribbled a small note under the text:)\ne2-e4, d7-d6 (1/4)",

        "text": "The Ferumbras Files\nThe followers of Ferumbras believe that in his early career, the ambitious Ferumbras acquired access to the shrouded library of Zathroth. They disagree, however, in the details on how exactly the vile Magician managed to do this. While some claim he was the favoured of Zathroth, others argue that he breached the library's defenses and somehow stole a part of the knowledge. Even in this the specifics are debated. An intriguing variant claims, Ferumbras once was the head librarian of the shrouded hoard. Once a kind and caring man, he became more and more obsessed with the knowledge in his care and the insights he gained turned him cynical and jaded. At some point his ambitions and power became too dangerous and he was expelled from the library. The most outlandish tales even make him a physical manifestation of forbidden knowledge. The story goes that Zathroth, who obsessively accumulated knowledge, did not care about it's containment. The knowledge was powerful though that mere books could not keep it and it seeped into the library, absorbed more and more forbidden knowledge until it became sentient and created itself a physical vessel that fled the library, later becoming known as Ferumbras. Based on the the few sources available, sages of that topic suggest that Ferumbras was the descendant of a member of the brotherhood of bones that fled and got into hiding after their forces suffered a major defeat. Ferumbras was supposedly raised in secrecy and taught in the ways and secrets of the brotherhood. Since this would not explain his immense power in one way or the other, Zathroth's library seems an all too easy and convenient explanation for his stellar rise to power. Others attribute this to his bloodline, which included the likes of Goshnar and dates back to the first magician kings of Ankrahmun who unified their people against the lizard threat.",

The warriors of the uppermost class are usually so well educated they control some amount of magic, often used to augment their own strength and defense. They are the heroes and role models of the lower class.

        "text": "My dear friend,\nas your former teacher and mentor I am pleased by the eagerness you show for your researches, but there are certain things I want to remind you about. First of all, the magic the Yalahari used for their golem creation might as well be based on a entirely different magic system. Just like we cannot use the magic of the mysterious voodoo with our scholarly magic, it might be similarly impossible to use the Yalahari ritual if we were able to get hold of it. It is far more likely that we will have to understand what the ritual does and then try to recreate its effects with our own magical approach. I do not need to point out what a tedious and time consuming process that would require. It is entirely possible that the process would last more than a lifetime to be accomplished. Even if we stumbled on the original ancient rituals involved in the process of golem creation and found the used magic to be similar to our own, we would still face the problem that we were playing with forces which we do not really understand which involves certain risks that better be avoided (but I know that I am talking to deaf ears here given your eagerness to follow your ideas).\nAt a last point I want to remind you that magic as the predominant science in our world has made most other sciences almost obsolete. So we know certainly less about metallurgy and mechanics than the Yalahari did. I strongly recommend to consult the dwarfish technomancers on this issue. They possess the most knowledge concerning these subjects in our world and though they are not known to share their knowledge with outsiders, they might be the only way to gain a glimpse of understanding the nature of the mechanical golems.\nAs long as we do not get help from the technomancers, I strongly recommend to concentrate your researches on the rituals, and to use parts of old and destroyed golems you might acquire one way or the other for your studies. It would not be useful for your researches to wear out your mental and physical resources by trying to solve both problems at once.\nI will continue my own researches as good as possible from here and keep you informed of every progress I make.\nYour friend M.",

        "text": "Yalahari Worker Golems - A Treatise\nThe specific golems that are used by the Yalahari have certain features that distinguish them from the more commonly known elemental golems. While certain physiological features are quite obvious, the most important difference is their mind function. They certainly possess some degree of intelligence that surpasses the instinctive level on which lesser elementals operate. Yet, they seem to lack a great deal of impulsiveness and individuality that is common among elementals. Like other golems some basic tasks can be implemented into their minds, and like parrots they can learn some basic phrases which they, unlike parrots, can use in an intelligent and intentional way. Actually their level of intelligence is only rivalled by certain necromantic golems and constructs that have been created by implanting existing spirits into the constructed body. Their lack of individuality makes it quite easy to control them, which by itself would already classify them as the most useful minions. However, what really lets them shine in the area of artificial servants is the composition of their brain (if the centre of a golem's consciousness can be called that way). Their brain is a certain crystal structure, not too different from the one of the rare crystal golems. Now, the most impressive breakthrough the Yalahari accomplished in the area of golem creation is the duplication of brain patterns from one crystal to another. That way the Yalahari were able to duplicate a certain behaviour of a trained golem into newly created golems. For this reason, newly created golems were almost instantly useful and ready for work. As an interesting side note, the same or at least a quite similar technique was used by the Yalahari to operate certain apparatuses and their so-called factories in which highly modified golems created objects in mass production. The usage of crystals by the ancient Yalahari must have been enormous.\nFor their golems they used the easy controllable mindset of their crystal-stored mind patterns with an endurable and easy producible body of rather cheap metal. For that, they constructed basic metal castings that worked like enormous metal puppets. Using complicated but standardised clockwork mechanisms, they enabled these bodies to use certain forms of movement that usually followed the patterns of natural movement. The movement was amplified by the ingenious usage of physics and metallurgy as well as miniature steam engines.\nSo far the creation of Yalahari golems is comprehensible, even if the mechanic of a golem's body is not fully understood and not reproducible with ordinary metal and alloys. What really baffled the scientific community was the way the two parts, the crystal core or brain and the mechanical clockwork body, worked together. It is quite certain that it has to do with magnetism, electricity and heat but the details are completely unclear. There certainly exists an overall enchantment on the golem but it seems so minor that it is supplementary at best.\nIt seems that in our days no new golems are created anymore, so we must assume that the secret of golem creation might be lost. On the other hand, there is still a great number of existing golems and Yalahari artefacts that can be studied. This might be a chance to either recreate or emulate the process of golem creation which would lead to a tremendous breakthrough in the magical sciences.",

        "text": "Your Golem and You Volume 3\nThe second kind of known golems are necromantic golems. Some scientists of high renown question the relation between the two groups of golems but certain similarities hint at a common source.\nTo create a necromantic golem a special vessel is created and prepared. Then a spirit is forced into the body. In a third step the body is animated and becomes some sort of prison for the bound spirit.\nThe similarity lies in the preparation of the body. The following ritual that forces a spirit into the body shows a striking resemblance of the ritual to create a consciousness in elemental golems. While in an elemental golem the created consciousness is by nature bound to the condensed core, the consciousness of a necromantic golem is the spirit that is bound into the golem.\nThe form of the necromantic golem is almost neglectable as the bound spirit is usually that of an humanoid who would have difficulties operating a body that has other physical features than a humanoid. The spirits bound by the ritual are usually old and drained that have lost conciousness long ago. Those souls are weak but connect best with the enchantments of the prepared body. Even if some malignant spirit is drawn into the construct, it usually becomes not the core consciousness but technically possesses the original weak soul instead.\nSometimes the creator of a necromantic golem manages to use the head or the brain of a deceased as focus to force the original soul to become the core of the necromantic golem. As this is already possible shortly after death, the anguish that originates from the reconnection with the world of the living causes severe damage to the sentience of the creature and leaves the construct usually mad and demented. Though the whole practice of necromancy is questionable at best, the latter experiments are only frivolous flirts with disaster and are doomed to failure.\nEven if the creation of necromantic golems can also be seen as another form of raising undead, it has become a science of its own. Skilful necromancers created fascinating variants of the basic ritual to bind animal spirits into corpses that can come in different shapes and sizes, and some even managed to create golems out of single body parts like hands.\nThe secrecy and prohibitions from which necromancy suffers led to an imbalance between a very small number of competent scientists and a large amount of self-styled necromancers that mess around without the necessary skills. They experiment with incomplete rituals and poor material substitutes resulting in much trouble and many accidents. Even if they live long enough to move further in theirs studies, those self-styled necromancers show neither knowledge nor respect to the roots of necromancy.",

        "text": "Your Golem and You Volume 2\nThe most common materials for golems are closely related to the element earth. Here the basic material follows the rule that the less hard the material in question is, the more easy it is to condense it to consciousness. The common assumption that softer materials are more prone to burnout, power failures and malfunctions is a misconception. Technically, the \"soft\" golems are not more faulty than their harder counterparts. Everyday praxis though shows that much less skill is needed to create them, so less skilled enchanters usually choose softer materials for their golems, leading to the great number of failures. Still, there is an issue with durability as the softer material is more vulnerable to the ravages of time than harder one. This can be compensated by the skill of the caster though. In theory, a caster that creates the easier \"soft\" golems can put more effort into the perfection of the durability of the enchantment. When creating a harder golem, he has to put more attention to the condensation of the consciousness and can spent less effort on durability. Given the different inherent durability of softer and harder golems, all in all the durability should be roughly the same.\nThe most common material for a golem is clay. It is quite easy to activate and the material allows easy additional, supplemental manipulation like the engraving of runes and glyphs that enhance the control over the entity or add certain capabilities. Clay is closely followed by certain forms of stone, though here significantly more talent is needed for the rituals. This is followed by various forms of metal. The manipulation of metal is not trivial though and the rate of failure rises tremendously. The most difficult creations are those made of crystal or gems. Already the creation of a gem huge enough to create a golem, let alone its modelling, is beyond the grasp of ordinary sorcery. Giant crystals are more common. However, the stability of such crystal formations is often lower than desired, and often, tremendous effort is wasted only to learn that the crystal was flawed from the beginning.\nOther variants of elemental golems are speculated about, but yet, there is no solid proof about their existence. Given the scientific knowledge about problems that would have to be overcome, their existence is more than questionable.",

        "text": "Your Golem and You Volume 1\nScientists distinguish between two kinds of golems: elemental and necromantic. Elemental golems consist of primal elements and are magically that condensed that a elemental consciousness is formed. That way a quasi-elemental is created, sharing several characteristics with true elementals. In the process of their creation, such artificial elementals only possess a rudimentary consciousness. Sometimes, if the concentration of elements is not sufficient and no consciousness is created, it leaves the creator with nothing than an empty hull and a burned-out elemental core. Even if activated successfully, a careless ritual might leave the golem flawed, which sooner or later leads to a similar burnout of the core. A flawless golem will exist for many years, probably outliving its creator by far. This might not be desirable, though, as a golem's consciousness might grow over the years, giving him a certain sense of intelligence and unwanted individuality.\nEven though in theory all elements qualify to 'spark' the necessary consciousness in a golem, their physical restrictions make certain materials more suitable than others. It is almost impossible to form a body out of air or fire that exists long enough to have the correct enchantments placed upon. Further, the lack of a physical body makes the magic charging of the hull next to impossible. Technically, air and fire golems are beyond the grasp of mortal sorcery. I only include these possibilities of golem creation because we knew it has been done under certain conditions and by gifted individuals or groups with tremendous resources.\nWater golems are similarly difficult to create, though this can be compensated by freezing water and giving it a solid form. Ice golems can be created, enchanted and manipulated by the usual rituals. The drawback is that a a thawing water elemental's core is subject to destabilisation and water, or better, ice golems are only of limited use. The climate to sustain ice golems is usually that uninhabitable to its creator that the effort of their creation is questionable, particularly considering the fact that there are golems made of more reliable material available.",

        "text": "The Art of the Technomancers Volume 2\nBoth kinds of technomancers work on inventions and improvements. It is usual practice to built something to prove it can be done without any regards to applicability. For instance the technomancer Sileas built a fully functional artificial arm - which was 30 metres long and had a service tunnel for repairs and adjustments.\nLater, efforts are made to improve the own work or that of a predecessor. With the patience of a dwarf that spans his whole long lifetime and even longer, they work on a project as long as it takes to finish it. The former mentioned Sileas commented on his finished gigantic arm that it might take only somewhat over 1000 years until an arm might be constructed that could be used as a prosthesis. The whole technomancy circles around inventions and improvements. Most technomancers concentrate on a single project. This is not necessarily part of the technomancy per se, but probably rather a product of the dwarven nature. Though technomancy has established a lot of formal rules that should ensure the safety of the technomancers and their surroundings, it is not uncommon that technomancers get injured by testing their machines. Aged technomancers often have lost limbs, their hearing or even their eyesight to their experiments. Astonishingly enough, death is a rare occurrence among these accidents which might proof that the traditional safety measures are elaborated enough to prevent the worst. Still, other dwarfs who are not exposed to risks in their own professions usually see the injuries of technomancers as sign of their carelessness which is only a prejudice given the existence of the technomancers' code.\nAs it is common that an invention is worked on over several generations, technomancers gladly share their knowledge among their own people. However, they are more than reserved when it comes to share this knowledge with an outsider. Only a few secrets are actually considered off-limits to outsiders due to some secrecy code, but most technomancers are unwilling to share even the most basic knowledge. It is assumed that this behaviour results from the fact that technomancers had to become outsiders of their society to learn these secrets, so they are not willing to simply share their hard-earned knowledge. Another reason for this secrecy is based on the fact that most technomancers consider even the most complete and polished invention as just not ready to be released to the public. No proud dwarf would ever share an invention with the public that is not absolutely flawless. Others again fear, and with good reason, the harm that could be done if their knowledge would get into the wrong hands and for this reason refuse to share their knowledge.",

        "text": "The Art of the Technomancers Volume 1\nWhile most dwarfs cling to the principle of earth or fire, some individuals break with this tradition and rather follow the principles of what they simply call 'the machine'. This breach with the traditions is a rare act in a society like that of the dwarven race that knows hardly and changes or surprises. One might argue this is the only way a dwarf can do something extraordinary and it might rely on dwarfs with comparatively rebellious mindsets, but all technomancers encountered seemed genuinely interested if not obsessed with their technomancy. It might be debatable if it is rather a religion or a philosophy, for most technomancers it is the only profession they pursue. Unlike other dwarfs that follow the paths of earth or fire, technomancers usually only pick a profession that is directly related to mechanics. Even a farmer that followed the ways of technomancy was known to apply all kinds of self-made machinery to his profession, but this, as previously stated, is a really rare occurrence. Technomancy is not overly popular in the dwarven society. Only a handful of technomancers exits and perhaps a good dozen of apprentices. Other dwarfs respect the technomancers, but usually think of them as at least a bit odd. On the other hand, the dwarven society welcomes technomantic inventions now and then. For the dwarfs the adaption of such new technology is a slow process and it takes often years of testing and getting used to the new tool until it is truly accepted by dwarven society. Some of the more extraordinary inventions never leave the workshops of the technomancers. In particular, inventions that seem to have no direct, practical use and a considerable advantage compared to 'the old ways' have a hard time to be accepted. This leads to two kinds of responses by the technomancers: some just give in and try to built just what the community is ready to accept. Those are usually the more sociable technomancers that sometimes have extensive contacts outside their own society. Others bury themselves deeper and deeper into technomantic knowledge becoming more and more strange over the years. Those technomancers are often far away from the usual thinking processes of a dwarf, as they only think in formulas and numbers. Sometimes their grasp of communication becomes so different that they cannot communicate with dwarfs anymore that are no technomancers.",

        "text": "Mahatheb was the greatest vizier the city of Ankrahmun had ever seen. His counsel was prized and his wisdom legendary. He served the pharaoh Ashmunrah dutifully and faithfully. The wise Mahatheb had ever been wary of the studies of the pharaoh's dark son, Arkhotep. But Arkhothep whispered lies into the ears of the pharaoh and poisoned his mind and heart. In his wisdom, Mahatheb saw the futility of his attempts to destroy the mists of treachery that clouded the pharaoh's vision. Instead, he planned to help his liege in another way. Knowing that Arkhothep was using dark sorcery to gain power, he decided to gather more might himself in order to fight him. Being no sorcerer, the vizier looked to the powers of the legendary djinn, and studied ways to bind them to his will. After long research, he learned that even the djinn had to bow to someone who knew their true name. He pondered his options, when seemingly fate smiled upon him and provided him with an opportunity too good to pass it by. The well-known king of thieves, Qual'Jehari, had fallen in love with Xetharis, the beautiful daughter of the vizier. When he asked for her hand in marriage, Mahatheb presented him with a condition: to steal the true names of the djinn and give them to him. Qual'Jehari, love-stricken and blinded by arrogance, accepted without hesitation. He left the court at once, promising to return soon. Years passed, and the thief was not seen or heard again, while the vile Arkhotep grew in power and assembled his co-conspirators. Running out of time and options, the vizier tried other ways to stop the pharaoh's son, but to no avail. When Mahatheb was desperate and almost ready for a deed of desperation, a ragged pauper appeared in his chambers. The vizier was about to call the guards when the pauper revealed himself to be no other than Qual'Jehari. He was gaunt and marked by his quest, having lost both his eyes and his youth. With shaking hands he presented Mahatheb some scrolls of paper that had the names of numerous djinn written upon them. But the vizier's joy was cut short when he recognised that in truth only a tiny fraction of all the djinn names had been acquired. In his anger he had the thief flogged and thrown out on the streets. He studied the names of the djinn he had acquired and wondered how to put them to best use. But luck is a treacherous lover, and it had already betrayed the good Mahatheb. The thief had withheld one of the djinn names, and used that djinn to steal the beloved daughter of Mahatheb. This caused so much attention that the evil Arkhothep became aware of the vizier's actions and put his own plans into motion. Mahatheb however was wise enough to see the threat coming, and used the powers of the djinn to flee Ankrahmun, to a foreign land, taking all of his servants and riches with him. But he had underestimated the great heights of power that Arkhothep had already climbed to. The vile prince used his sorcerous might to cast a death curse on him, and all the might of Mahatheb's bound djinn was not powerful enough to protect him. All he could do was to prolong the inevitable. He used his remaining might not to build himself a palace as he had intended, but a tomb in which he planned to endure the passing of time until the one day he would rise again. His djinn erected the tomb, and Mahatheb was embalmed by his servants, who were then put to death by the djinn so they could join their master in the afterlife. Only I, his chronicler, was allowed to live a little longer to tell his tale. When this book is finished, I too will drink the poisoned wine that the guarding djinn will serve me to fulfil my destiny. May we all one days rise again by the power of the wise Mahatheb.",

        "text": "The Moonshadow Temple\nIf some old legends are true, many centuries ago a big temple was built underneath the island of Grimvale. A spacious subterranean building, whose purpose is unknown nowadays. It was incidentally rediscovered a few years back when one of the village children got lost in the tunnels underneath the island, and found the temple ruins. We made some inquiries in the libraries of Edron, Thais and Carlin and found out the following: once this site bore the Name \"Moonshadow Temple\". It served as a place where, through crevices and by wisely arranged mirrors, the full moon's rays were conducted deep into earth's interior. Whether they served magical or cultic purposes down there or whether the full moon itself was an object of worship, is no longer known. Built of black granite and partly of white marble, the temple is of considerable size. Lately, since the were-sickness plagues Grimvale, the were-creatures have withdrawn to the tunnels and constantly descend down to the old ruins. At the times of the full moon they come up to the surface to haunt men; but more often they dwell inside the old temple ruins. Whether their interest in this site arises from its connection with the full moon or has different reasons remains a secret for now.",

        "text": "About Were-Transformation\nScholars call it the were-sickness or the Curse of the Full Moon - but whether it is a disease or a curse is still unclear. Some claim it is similar to a contagious malady; others take the view that it is a curse in the classical magical sense. But about one question, the sages are in agreement: the taint is caused by a bite or a scratch of a were-creature. Were-creatures are humans who transform into savage beasts, mainly at times of the full moon. These humans assume the forms of wolves, for example, and may look like common wolves or like a cross between wolf and man. As long as the moon is not full, they seem to be normal humans, and act in a completely ordinary way. But in the light of the full moon, they show their true face. At an advanced stage however, the transformation may take place at other times as well. There are also other forms that afflicted humans assume: bears, boars, foxes, badgers or weasels, depending on an area's wildlife. There are even tales that in other parts of this world, humans assume the forms of local carnivores there, such as lions, tigers, panthers or even crocodiles. Besides humans, elves, dwarves and orcs can also be affected by the were-transformation. So, in short, the following traits are typical of the were-transformation:\n1. The transformation into a wild, at least partly carnivorous, animal. The person assumes either a common animal's form or appears as a cross between animal and man.\n2. The transformation is caused by a were-creature's bite or scratch.\n3. The first transformation takes place at the time of the full moon. During the transformation, the affected have no control over themselves and turn into ferocious beasts. In this stage, they attack even their own relatives, though no other were-creatures. However, espacially strong-willed individuals may resist this gruesome urge at first.\n4. If persons are affected by the sickness or curse for a longer time, they are able to transform themselves beyond the times of the full moon.\n5. In the early stage, the were-transformation is curable and reversible by a very rare plant, the purple nightshade. It is said that it blossoms only at full moon in subterranean tunnels where the moon rays are falling through fissures in the surface.\n6. To weaken a powerful were-creature, silvered traps are very useful. Liquid silver is needed to create such a trap, but this rare metal may only be found underground and at full moon.",

They considered him as a tool that could easily be manipulated. Moreover, it was unlikely that he would intervene in their schemes. The land was full of corruption and intrigues. Several of the ruling families were feuding each other for reasons that had been forgotten in the course of time. The great snake looked at its people with disgust as they had stopped worshipping it for the benefit of gaining profit in the mortal world. The great snake was displeased and so it let a drop of poison from its right fang fall down on the land. Just like a plague, the poison killed half of the population to teach them humility. But greed and treachery had deep roots in the civilisation, and despite the priests' warnings and prophecies, those in power continued their heathen ways, and even tried to use the punishment of the great snake to their own advantage against their enemies. And the great snake hissed in anger. And its hiss stirred the minds of the lesser creatures, and so all the soft skins and horned ones grew anxious and drew their weapons. Like a flood, this horde swarmed the lands of the lizards, killing thousands of those who had survived the plague. Instead of listening to the priests of the great snake, the lizards forgot their noble heritage and hid in fear in their cities, hoping that the ravaging horde would devastate another city.\nThen the deceivers came from the north. They were only a few but full of spite and malice. They sensed the greed and treachery that now ruled all the lizard people and they saw that they had more in common than just scales. They saw an opportunity to exploit this weakness and fed upon the depravity of the society. So they maliciously decided to help the lizard people but only to lure them into enslavement. And all those blind lizards were so soaked with greed and lies that they they turned away from the great snake and began to worship the dragons. And the great snake turned its head from the lizard people of Zao and never looked back. The great snake abandoned the lizards just like the lizards had abandoned the great snake. But now some of the lizards felt a sudden emptiness and their fear grew. They felt that they had lost something vital and valuable. They suddenly saw their mistakes and the treachery of the dragons. They united to overthrow their reign. This rebellion was the last chance for the lizards to regain the favour of the great snake. This was the only chance of redemption. But after all those years of neglecting the great snake, they could not muster the faith needed to succeed. And so they failed. The vile dragons though would not allow another rebellion and bound all the lizards by dark magic to their will once and for all.",

        "text": "Year 30 Tzuzak VII\nOur forces are ready to strike now. We are only a few but we are dedicated to our cause. The dragons must die or everything is lost. I know they had arrived in desperate times. Although some of them looked weary when they arrived from the north, they were powerful and majestic beasts indeed. I assume they are the survivors of some great catastrophe but they did not want to talk about that and nobody wanted to push them. With all the losses due to plague and war, their promises to lead us to victory over our enemies sounded too tempting to resist. Moreover, there was no other option left. Which each victory their support amongst the people grew stronger. Tzuzak soon called for them and they nourished the king with favours like someone is feeding a pet snake with rats. Their influence over the court grew steadily and many of the officials were eager to please them to gain their favours as well. It became more and more obvious that the dragons had turned into the actual leaders. Some of us could no longer stand this situation. We gathered in secrecy to form an alliance against the dragons. Treachery is abound in this land, and we have to act now or all will be lost. We will strike this night at several key positions and hopefully not only cause considerable damage but also lead the people to oppose the remaining dragons. Tomorrow night I will know if our rebellion has been victorious.",

        "text": "In the year 21 of the reign of Tzuzak VII, a great plague spread over the land. While the children of the serpent perished by the vile orcs, minotaurs and humans flourished. It did not take long until most of the southern lands was lost to the barbarians. The army was dwindling and civil unrest growing. Even when finally the cure for the plague had been found, the barbarians advanced. Too much territory had already been lost, too many soldiers had fallen victim to the plague and the initial attacks. It seemed as if the plague had clouded the minds of our people. Instead of fighting the common enemy, certain elements conspired against the king and each other. Without unified resistance of our weakened forces, the end of civilisation seemed inevitable. But some lizardmen who no longer listened to the lies of the prophets who believed in false gods started to pray for salvation. And even though they were only a few, they were heard. Our saviours came from the north. They abandoned the paradise that they had ruled to save our kin. On mighty wings they came with the north wind. Their wrath was like fire, they crushed our opponents and sowed fear into their vile hearts. They gathered our troops and led them from victory to victory. They blessed the lizards of true heart and led those lost in the darkness of lies to the light of truth. Those who refused to see the truth were eradicated by cleansing fire. They healed the wounds of the land and the wounds in the heart of our people. They burned the curtain of lies that had prevented our people from seeing the truth for so long. When they saw that the realm was safe once again, they got ready to return to their godly realm of perfect harmony. But the lizard people desperately begged them to stay. They offered them the leadership over the whole nation as they knew they would be unable to rule and secure the realm without the help of the divine dragons. Reluctantly the mighty dragons accepted. They gave up their paradise to save our people and adopted us as their children. The mightiest of them all became the dragon emperor of our realm.",

I was never overly religious but when death is knocking at your door, your attitude is changing and your perspective shifting. I have seen much in my long life. I worked many years as a scribe in the palace of King Tzuzak VII until I fell into disgrace due to an intrigue some higher officials played on each other. In retrospect I think it was for my best. Not only did I find a never known tranquillity and peace in my new life, but I also was spared by the great changes that turned the whole realm upside down. In my seclusion not only the plague passed me without causing any harm, I also missed the arrival and the rise of the dragon kings. Of course there were legends about dragons, but no one had seen any for the last few thousand years. Since their arrival a few years ago, I have only seen a few of them from afar but I can imagine the awe they are causing in each being that faces them. I heard only little about the changes that came along with them. I cannot say it is a bad thing that Tzuzak stepped back for a new ruler. For all I have heard, the dragon kings are not much worse than the bureaucrats that preceded them. What troubles me more is the change of the land that came along. Perhaps you need to be as old as me to notice this change. Each of the youngsters I made aware of some of the changes just shrugged them off. But I can see that they are there. I see that the fields yield less and less each year. Plants and animals grow in strange and unhealthy forms and colours. And it turns worse with every year. The source of this all seems to be somewhere in the north. I fear what the land will look like in a few decades. Alas, I won't be there to witness it.",

Of course this greedy bunch is complaining about the food rations, but it is not our intention to have fat and lazy subjects. When the regents see it fit, they might reward some of them with extra rations but usually we are rather forced to punish the peasants. The most common transgression is indeed the theft of food. Usually a whole village is punished for that as this will teach them to watch over their own kin more closely. Ungrateful as they are, the peasants often complain about the privileges they enjoyed in the past. It is indeed a sad thing that the regents of old lacked the responsibility to their position and did not work hard enough to further the riches of the realm but wasted resources on the ungrateful and greedy masses. The punishment for spreading such stories is a difficult thing since those who are guilty are mostly old and rather fragile. If they do not survive their well deserved whipping, the peasants are enraged and sometimes attack our officials. I therefore strongly suggest to relocate some of the funding of the army to local forces to keep a closer eye on imminent rebellions.",

I even doubted some of their essential doctrines and I remember tales from the dawn of time that made no reference to a great snake at all. Yet, those priests might be our last hope to get rid of the new rulers. The priests did not like my independence in the past, though, and I am not sure if I am welcome in their ranks.

But I can sense the taint that is spreading, and the spirits of earth, water, and wind tell me about some presence that is poisoning the soil and the springs. I can feel it also when I am fully attuned to the land. The new regime does not like if people talk about such things, and I was removed from my position in the ministry of agriculture. My abilities made me a precious member of the order and I used to be influential and respected. And now they strip me off like an old skin. I don't understand what is happening and the spirits can offer me little help in this matter. I retreated to my old home, banned from the gardens I loved so much. The spirits are still with me but my lifetime achievement was taken away from me. I could have understood the decision if I had supported the resistance in the civil war in any way but I was never a politician and did not take part in that rebellion. What is wrong about warning people of something bad that is happening? The dragon kings can't see that as an act of rebellion or spread of unrest. I just want to help with all my power. Why would they want to keep such a blight a secret? Is it perhaps their fault in some way? I fear the worst. I have talked to several of my old friends about that issue and they just won't listen. Even the most open-minded seem to have changed since some time. It is almost as if they were replaced by someone else. All they say is 'the dragon kings want this ...', ' the dragon kings want that ...' as if that were the only thing that is of importance to them. Perhaps I was too reclusive, too absorbed with talking to the spirits, and I don't understand my fellow lizards anymore. But there is still hope. I was called to the court of one of the dragon kings. I will probably speak to one of his highest ranking followers. I guess they have heard about my concerns and will give me an opportunity to speak about my concerns. Surely they will finally recognise the importance of my observations. Perhaps I will regain my old position and will soon have access to the gardens again.",

Only the dragons' interference turned the tides of war. Now most generals fear what would happen if this support were withdrawn. Could we repel another attack of the orcs? Would a civil war not only make us more vulnerable with no winner at all? I fully understand and share these views. Still, it is our only hope. If we bow to the dragons now, they will rule us once and for all. We have to act here and now. Yet, I am afraid not many will join us and the temptation to betray our cause for some better position in the hierarchy is a constant danger. Our best hope is to form a resistance in secret and then strike at the dragon kings at once. None of them shall survive and we have to avoid fighting other parts of the army. We must save every strength that is left for the time ahead, for a time when the dragon kings are gone. With a beheading strike we will free our nation.",

The local governors have grown accustomed to rather shunt infected people into the provinces of their rivals than to pay for their treatment. People are cheap and plenty, medication is not. As a physician I cannot agree to such an attitude, but I am in the employ of a governor and have little influence on his decisions, and even less on those of others. The nobility in turn values its health quite much. Even the most minor symptoms have to be treated with the most expensive and powerful potions at our disposal.",

They claim that the diseased are threatening to invade their fortresses in the hope of finding some cure or nourishment there. Therefore, they need every men at their disposal. I will gather the local guards that are now on their way to stop the spread of the plague by burning infected villages and join them with my remaining soldiers. Considering our might and expertise, the orcish raiders are of course no threat. I will take the rejection of support as an opportunity to prove my superior strategical and logistical skills. There has not been any glorious battle for decades. Even though I fear that the reports of panicked peasants exaggerate the number of the orcs, there is still hope that they will be enough to give my soldiers some exercise. The captain of the local border patrol has remained silent for quite a while now. I assume he is still figuring out how to explain that he had let slip some of the orcs. I will not accept the decimation of his ranks due to the plague as an excuse. The plague is something we all have to deal with. It is even possible that one of my rivals has paid him for his inattention in the hope to disrupt my control of my province in these hard times. I think it will be the wisest decision to have said captain executed as soon as I have dealt with the orcs.",

Only me and a few others still maintain some form of patrols. It seems that due to the lack of resistance, the orcs roam quite freely in our lands. Ironically the calling back of troops seems to have brought the plague into the fortresses. So the reinforcement actually turned into weakening the positions. When the emperor learns about this, I am sure some heads will roll. Without any force to restrict them, hordes of infected peasants flee their villages and spread the plague further. From all what I can tell, the plague has spread everywhere by now and even the fortresses are no longer safe. I think once the orcs retreat, we will have a big task of rebuilding at hand. With the obvious failure of certain governors, I will gain more power and influence. Perhaps I can even convince the emperor to merge some of the bordering provinces with mine.",

In fact in ancient texts I found a report of an occurrence some generations ago with almost identical symptoms. The plague of these times was only local. The village was put under quarantine and the best physicians and supplies were sent. Over the course of a month, the plague had passed through and from over 100 infected less then 20 had died. It seems the plague in our days was ignored by the authorities for quite a while. Later a local governor tried to cover up this mistake and kept the plague secret. To ensure that, he chose a rather aggressive approach and had the village burnt down with all its inhabitants. It seems that some of the villagers had escaped though and fled to relatives in neighbouring villages. As the word of the extermination of the village spread, many peasants fled their villages as soon as the first symptoms of the plague showed up. Still, it seems the plague is hitting the peasantry harder than it had in the past. I think I will have to investigate their living conditions to get a better insight.",

        "text": "Excerpt from \"Deep Thoughts\", personal comments of Chronicler Lagatos to his unfinished work \"Encyclopedia Terra Subaqua\":\nBefore the oceans that formed on Tibia took the shape they hold today, the underwater world of Tibia was already a diverse, busy and sprawling place. Ruled by the one god of the deep: Qjell*, Deus Profundis. Guarded by three depth lords: Obujos, Defensor Profundis, Jaul, Protektor Profundis and Tanjis, Expeditus Profundis, he dwelled on the very bottom of the deepest ocean. (*These names have been repeated excessively in almost all of the few writings discovered of this old civilisation so far and were extracted as the names of the three main individuals around Qjell.)\nAlthough violent and often primitive in nature, these creatures of the deep are strangely interconnected and should be considered intelligent beings. They communicate and interact with each other on a higher level than most inhabitants of the Tibia oceans. However, each of their existences is mostly focused on specific tasks. As each Deepling has to play its role, the social structure of their society is clearly structured and layered in strict castes. From what is known through collected studies and vague interpretations of writings in the foreign language of higher Deeplings, higher castes suppress members of lower classes systematically. This is achieved by radical control of everyday life of lower Deeplings and strict classification. Besides fear and oppression, higher classes especially utilise limitations to reach these goals. Parts of the society will not be able to access specific religious sites, sacred writings or even habitats of higher members. It is not possible for the majority of Deeplings to acquire the knowledge necessary to breach their social status for their entire life. Members of the upper class hand-pick other Deeplings for their future role as they see fit. Effectively destroying their former social life, family ties and former duties. From what is known to this date, the selected members accept their fate for a \"greater good\" of which it is unknown whether it defines worshipping their God King Qjell or simply living in service for the upper castes. It is highly possible that this system of control is maintained to reduce the risk of riots and keep the general mood and morale at a manageable level. It is not known how old (or young) this civilisation was when they decided to \"reduce\" their society to cattle and shepherd, but it is possible that they found this to be the only form that guarantees survival of the race as a whole. So far this concept did not fail.\nLower castes consist of scouts, various kinds of warriors and simple workers. So far it is assumed that the main tasks of female Deeplings, while being valued very highly in all layers of Deepling society, focusses on creative or supportive tasks as well as their offspring. Though it is unknown whether there are specific roles for females in higher castes.",

Floating a drop above the rain and dodging beams of the twin suns, he would embrace the disembodied freedom of his true self.\nHe was a spirit and a ghost. His soul moved into the very walls and fences of every house and court. Claiming the very foundations of this watery city as his own.\nThe Swimmer now lingers in shadowy corners, damp and dark and hollow.

An evil never described in writing nor mentioned by a scholar for it was blackness incarnate. Chaos and darkness reigned and the deep suffered direly. For centuries our world was shattered and occluded from light and warmth. Those born under a weak tide were abducted, captured, eaten by fiends of the void. The strongest would prevail, but their numbers were small. Our race was facing extinction before they were touched by even a single beam of light. It was in these darkest of nights and the deepest of depths that a Deepling would rise to face the unlight. It was Qjell who was the first, the one to stand against these vile odds. He lived as one of us, he suffered among us. He reached for the surface and brought the light, his gift, to undo the deeds of the wicked. To cleanse the deep and to wash our faces for we were to expect the twin suns. And he drove away the evil and was light incarnate. This was the time known as the First Coming. We shall await the Second Coming. And for we are given time on this world, we shall use it to erect walls and pillars, temples and towers, gardens and cities. For we shall prosper and grow to await the Coming of our God King Qjell.",

After their leaders were convinced that their future lied above sea level, more and more of them stopped maintaining the archives and tending for the books. With the Deeplings rallying for war, the great halls of the library were soon abandoned. The culture of these creatures is complex enough to produce a significant amount of literature. I have found several works about sea animals, food, architecture and even early philosophical theories. However, progression of the Deepling culture in this direction has long been abandoned in favour of war preparations or social oppression of lower castes.",

Faltugios suggested to run the ship with full power but I decided it is better not to take even the slightest risk on our mission. I am still convinced that IT will not allow us that easily to continue with our plans. Admittedly, I am extremely nervous, but this is no surprise considering the circumstances. Our knowledge is a burden not easy to bear. Therefore I keep these notes, knowing I'll have to destroy them when the time has come. I'm a bit nervous but I'm also anxious to learn what we will be able to do for the best of the world. Time will tell.\n... A sea serpent has attacked our ship. Could it be IT's doing? Though the serpent was quite huge, it was no match for our ship's weaponry. Still, could IT know our power? Or the strength of IT's tools? Even if IT is not working consciously against our efforts, it might be an instinctive reflex like an animal that flicks flies. If it was an effort to stop us, it would mean that IT is aware of our movements. Could it be? We still know so little about this enemy, which ironically is also our only defence and hope. Faltugios should be glad that the circle spared him of the tainted knowledge. Of course he is not and blames me for holding back information. If he only knew what a gift his ignorance is.\n... Today we had to sink two Treluvian ships which attacked us. They still hold a grudge against us for not supplying them with weapons, but they really should have known better. Still, I felt uncomfortable ordering their destruction. On the other hand, knowing what I know, to bother about it is pointless. They'd be dead, one way or the other, anyway.\n... It is hard to let no word slip my lips by accident. They do not have to know what I know.  Actually they probably already know too much for their own good. Or the good of the world that is. I try to blend out my knowledge as good as I can. Can IT perhaps hear my thoughts about IT somehow? The thing is that we know that there is some kind of dependency. But knowing about it only makes things work. I get a headache just thinking about it or even trying not to think about it. \n... With the weather that bad and several people seasick, I finally get some rest from their constant demands.\n... The weather gets better and the demands and hidden accusations are already increasing again. I was not prepared for such a thing. I am accustomed to my own studies in loneliness and not to care for the needs of several spoilt and eccentric scientists. I wonder if I was a good choice for that position. But now I have no choice.\n... The closer we come to the isle, the more it becomes clear what a responsibility lies on me. Sometimes when I try to sleep, I can feel it like a stone on my breast. What if the others refuse to work if they do not learn more about our agenda? What if we run into unexpected complications? What if we find out, our project is going to be a failure? What if IT knows more about us and our world than we assume? There are so many things that need to be considered. Would a good leader be as nervous as I am?",

The morale is not that good anyway, with this half-hearted excuse it will only get worse. I wonder if IT will use this to our disadvantage. IT might try to influence the behaviour of the team members and pit them against each other. We can only assume what IT has learnt about the psyche of the inhabitants of our world. But I should not allow myself to get distracted from the goal. 'If' and 'when' do not help here. Our only hope is the outcome of our mission - even though it means our annihilation.\n... The lack of comfort allows tensions to grow. I have to admit, I am glad when they fight each other and leave me alone for a while. When they come to me for a decision, though, and both parties want me to decide in their favour, things become complicated. I wish we could concentrate on our research instead. If only the base were ready.  \n... The worker golems have finally built a rudimentary base. Our priority is research and not comfort. There is still some unrest amongst the members of the expedition. They vent their anger about the obvious lie in complaints about the lack of comfort. Sometimes they slack in their work and are far too unenthusiastic in their researches. They are like spoilt children. I know they could do better but they are sabotaging our efforts by intentional laziness. I wish I could tell them. Then again I wish I would not know. What if IT uses the dissatisfaction of a researcher to sabotage our work? What if IT's agent is working right now while I am writings this? \n... Today the base was under attack. Not that this handful of sea dwellers posed a threat, but alone the fact that there was an attack at this remote isle makes me wonder if it was a coincidence or IT's work. I ordered to strengthen our defences and had some of the golems reconfigured for war purposes to boost our defence forces. That reminds me about the recent malfunctions of golems though. Although it is nothing extraordinary to have such a quota of malfunctions. I keep telling myself that such a rate is not unusual, not even in Yalahar and our golems here are working under less than optimal conditions. Yet, it might be that this subtlety is a trick of IT. Perhaps he is eroding our mission from many vantage points. All for itself might be of little interest and waved aside, but aren't that IT's fingerprints? Isn't that what we should expect from such an opponent? I will have to remain vigilant. I will register the slightest imperfections in our mission and analyse them thoroughly. I will not allow IT to triumph.\n... Several members of the expedition seem suspicious to me. Faltugios is the most vocal of them of course. He was criticising me right from the start and I wonder if he is an unwilling - or perhaps even a willing - tool of IT. Yes, perhaps some of them know more than they admit. It has been always our nature to be inquisitive and sceptical. What if one of them has learnt more than he was meant to know? What if he'd become tainted by the knowledge and perhaps was seduced with lies and promises? Well, I should probably not assume too much. Such things, though not unthinkable, have never occurred before. As far as we know, IT has no allies in this world, so my speculations regarding this are probably pointless. Yet, on the other hand, the responsibility for this expedition rests on my shoulders. So shouldn't I be prepared for the worst? However, I will have to improve the discipline somehow. I will grant privileges to some of the more cooperative ones and put restrictions on those who oppose me.",

        "text": "... The fishmen have attacked again. This time with a significant force and quite coordinated. I can't say I'm sad that their attack had cost the lives of Dregiz and Jurkoa. They have been consorts of Faltugios from the start and were causing more trouble than their research had helped us. Yet, the attack has proven we are in danger and I have called for reinforcements. Though the fish creatures were no match for our weapons and magic, our defence is too weak and we have too few capable fighters in the expedition team. Until the reinforcements arrive, I have to apply a more strict regime in the base. I can't allow my authority to be undermined. Our project is too important. After all, it is not some fancy research but the only hope for this world to survive. At least sort of. But I should not doubt our plan. This would only play in IT's hands for sure.\n... The attacks of the fishmen continue. The more we kill, the more they seem to call from the depths of the sea for their next attack. This can't be a coincidence anymore. It has to be IT's work. Nothing else makes any sense. Faltugios suggested to capture the creatures to try to communicate with them to learn their motivation. But this can't be allowed. If they do IT's bidding, they might know too much and their knowledge might taint the researchers. Also, regardless of their reasons, we cannot give in anyway. The first specimens are growing and show promise. We can't allow to be distracted.\n... The reinforcements still did not arrive. Actually, they were not even sent. I wonder what is happening in Yalahar. I heard about some quarrels in the circle and civil unrest. All foreigners are put under greater surveillance and the defences are strengthened against an attack that the circle can not specify to the masses. The tension in the city is growing and I fear that we might have to wait for reinforcements for quite a while. I have to issue stricter rules for the base, even if this will alienate some of the researchers even more. I'm sure the majority will understand that it is for the greater good.\n... No reinforcements and the attacks become more and more frequent. The situation is far from desperate but our efforts are  hampered so much that we have almost no progress. Distractions, distractions, always distractions. I hardly get any sleep with all this responsibility lying on my shoulders. Faltugios is a constant thorn in my side. All of his actions seem to aim at undermining my position. This can no longer be seen as a coincidence considering the things I know. He must be a, probably unknowing, pawn of IT. Regardless if he knows what he is doing or not, he is a threat that has to be eliminated for the best of all. It would be best if the fishmen got him.\n... Finally word arrived that a small military force will be sent to assist us. We had another casualty in the fight against the fishmen. Not to mention the golems we have lost or those who were left running only with rudimentary functions. Most of us are great in wielding magic but none of us has any prior experience in battle. Still, our equipment and magic is ridiculously overpowering those primitives. I knew we were powerful compared to other races but I did not truly understand it until I saw the hordes of fishmen perish at our meagre defences. What could we have done for our world? But our days are numbered. Our existence will come to an end and with the great cleansing we will allow the world a new beginning. This is what IT fears and this is why IT throws us these hindrances in our way. IT has minions, I am sure of that now. Faltugios is but one of them. The fishmen are others. Who knows who is working for IT?",

        "text": "... The military expedition has finally arrived. They brought two of the newest heavy war golems and about a dozen ordinary war golems. With them commander Traks and two scholars from the exalted college of magic arrived. This Traks seems to assume he is responsible for the base from now on but I cannot allow some clueless strongman to endanger our efforts with his ignorance. We need to get a definite decision from the circle in that matter. Given the unrest in Yalahar, it might take a while to hear from them. This might be another plot of IT to stop us, to stop ME! What if IT is aware of me, because I am aware of IT? That is the way it works, right? That is the whole idea behind the great cleansing. IT is probably aware of me and plots my demise!\n... I  knew it! Traks and Faltugios are becoming closer and closer every day. Although the attacks of the fishmen could be stopped and now our forces are pressing to the inland of the isle to route out the creatures, the knowledge that two of IT's pawns are operating right under my nose is an insult. I am responsible for this base. I am responsible for the experiments. I am responsible for the fate of the world!\n... IT is plotting. IT's minions are stalking me. The experiments finally make progress and show some promising results concerning all those disgusting creepers, but I know that IT is observing that, too, and IT is preparing to strike. Traks and Faltugios are avoiding me. My suspicions have long become a certainty. They are traitors of the world. It is my duty to stop them before they stop us. The unrest in Yalahar is growing. I am on my own. I wonder if there are contingency plans? Am I expendable? Is my project already deemed a failure due to the whisperings of IT? I cannot allow them to succeed. It is up to me to stop them. I alone can do it, stop them. I will save the world!\n... It is done! I locked up Faltugios and that stupid brute in a chamber and let some of the experimental specimens free. As expected the creatures perished, but they distracted this duo of traitors long enough to flood the room with gas. The others seem shocked by 'the accident'. If they only knew! If they only knew! But only I know it, know about IT. \n... What have I done? What if I was wrong? What if Faltugios and Traks were innocent. No, no, I was right. They were in liege with IT. Certainly even knowingly. But even if not, I had no choice. I have the responsibility. Only I know! This burden. It haunts me in my dreams. I hear their cries. Could I have stopped this from happening? Pointless. I have to do what I have to do. Everything else is pointless. Only the mission is important. If the mission succeeds, we'll be dead soon anyway. If not, we'll wish we were and the two should be grateful that I spared them this fate. I haven't done anything wrong. The lives of a few does not matter. They, no we, are dead already, but only I bear the burden to know this.\n... Can't sleep. Another night without sleep. At least it keeps the nightmares away. The scholars report that the fishmen seem to dwell in some caves on the isles. Though I fancy the idea to drown them in acid or something like that, it would require too much effort and resources. I hope they have been scared enough to stop their attacks. The blood toll they have paid is enormous. Yet, they did not stop. This should be prove enough that they are doing IT's work. Faltugios had some obscure theories about holy places and such. I know not much about this foolish religion stuff. We had abandoned the so-called gods for a good reason after all. I doubt, though, that they would be willing to sacrifice themselves for some imagined hex or charm. No, there must have been some power that forced them to die for IT. This is prove that IT's grasp on the world is growing and we have to stop IT.",

The blood toll has only to be high enough, so that even those primitives notice that they are no match for the power of the Yalahari. Enlightenment due to pain and suffering. I feel a bit sad that I have not learnt about these aspects earlier. Perhaps I could have convinced the circle to change their approach to spread enlightenment. There is so much I could have taught the world!\n... As the book of Dgjuna teaches us, I have put my new insights into good use. I use the war golems and some fishmen we have captured from the caves to improve our experiments. The idea is as simple as brilliant. The newly bred creatures are pitted against the fishmen or the war golems. If they fail, they are killed and fed to the other experiments. If they show at least some success, we try to improve them further. I will outsmart IT! My weapon will break IT's grasp on this world. I will send IT tumbling back into the abyss it came from. I will teach IT fear. Yet - am I truly safe? What if there are other conspirators around? The scholars could be some of them. They ask curious questions about the death of Traks. IT is probably whispering to them. IT tries to use them against me.\n... The scholars behave more and more suspicious. Sometimes I see them watching me. I know they talk about me. Of course I could be wrong. But why take the risk? They will die anyway as we all will. Why not getting rid of them? The project - it is more important than them. Their need is expended. I will take care that nothing stops me from rescuing the world. \n... Faltugios is alive!!! He sneaked into my room while I was sleeping and whispered something into my ears. I can't recall what. When I switched on the light, he was gone. Perhaps IT has saved him and granted him ghostly powers. Or was it his ghost? Has IT turned him into a ghost? I am so shaken, so tired. I don't understand. We have some apparatus that should prove effective against ghosts. Tomorrow, I will set some of them up.\n... The others are eyeing me suspiciously. I know I look tired and act nervously but perhaps they know what I have done. Perhaps the ghost of Faltugios talked to them. Or he is truly alive. I have activated some ghost traps but with no success. Still, I am sure I can see him sometimes just vanishing when I focus my sight on him. But regardless of these attacks on my resolve, we make some progress. We established six stable species of the creepers. Now we can begin to add the suitable traits to them as planned. Later we will breed those species together to a single new race. My creatures will become our final weapon.\n... I shouldn't have done this. Or I should have left as ... I don't know. Now I'm in it and can't get out. It is up to me to finish this experiment. Yalahar is in uproar. I think the knowledge is spreading somehow, making things only worse. I have spoken to Tjule of the circle and he claimed to have no knowledge at all about my mission. What is happening here? Is it not the will of the circle what we are doing here but the work of a splinter group? Whatever! The plan is right. It is our only hope. It doesn't matter who came up with the plan. The crawler army is the only way to stop IT once and for all.",

        "text": "... The creatures are growing stronger and stronger. Finally we see some success. Still, we are far from a breakthrough. To achieve our goal, the crawlers have to become unstoppable. Though we breed them to sustain themselves with almost any matter available and gave them a reproduction rate that pales those of any known crawlers, the rate of reproduction will not be sufficient to endure the final battle. And though they are more resilient and stronger as it should be physically possible, they are still not the ultimate tool they were meant to be. It will require some hard work and effort to improve them further. If I could only concentrate better. But they are haunting me. It is not only him but also others. Or is it him taking other forms? Some faces of my past, some faces I don't even know. I see them in the corners of my eye, only to vanish when I look at them.\n... They are after me. The ghosts and the others. I sent the scholars into the fish caves again and again but they do not die. They even brought me a living fishman as I requested. Now I have this creature here in my laboratory and it seems, it is eyeing me, too. Does it know it is only the pawn of a power it can't nor shouldn't comprehend? But strangely enough, his presence seems to keep the ghosts away. Or does it only distract me from the ghosts? Could it be that it was only my imagination that played tricks on me? No, I am too tired for these \"ifs\" and \"whens\". I have to stay focused on my tasks. The breeding goes fine, yet, the creatures lack the desired abilities. We have set some of them free on the isle to see how they can cope with the environment. \n... Our creatures do quite well in the wilderness. Some of the researchers suggested to breed some additional traits into the creatures. At least I think they did. It is hard for me to concentrate these days. All the stress, the strain, never some peace, no solace. I am talking to the fish-thing in the cage quite often as if it could understand me. It curiously watches me while I am experimenting with the magic of the chrimaerogizer. I find it amusing how the thing sometimes mimics my gestures and even moves it's lips as if it could speak. Or should I rate this as creepy? The thing that does not understand me has become my only confidant. When I am amongst others, I usually lose track of what they are telling me and I start to see things. Faces, people, suspicious shadows. It has to be my tiredness. It must be. There are no ghosts that could have escaped my traps. I must try to sleep more.\n... The situation in Yalahar seems chaotic. I can't talk to any of the higher ranking members of the circle or the Jagadah. The only ones I can reach are clueless foreign henchmen. It seems they recruited a lot of them since we have left. The others want to leave and look after their families and friends. The scholars are heavy supporters of this idea. Why can't they just die? As if there weren't enough trouble and problems already. We are so close to another breakthrough. Just recently one of the researchers bred an astonishing new ability into the crawlers. Before, they were able to produce certain organic material. Now he added a trait that allows special workers to melt with the material and give it some living and perhaps sentient abilities. But if we stopped here and now, everything would be lost. The perfect tool for the plan is so close. I cannot allow IT to triumph. IT tries to beat me and to stop the project. I know it all too well, I am IT's foremost enemy in the world. It is a battle between us. Between my resolve and IT's hunger.",

I need time. I need to forge the crawlers into the weapons that we need. They will have to purge the world. Without anything that could know about IT, IT will lose its grasp on the world and the world will be free of IT's influence once and for all. It was our fault to have lured IT here and it will be our glory to defeat IT! Sacrifice is necessary, that is how the world works. Sacrifice. I will have to stop them from leaving, somehow. Yes, this is my task.\n... What have I done? The sabotage of the ship went horribly wrong. Instead of not working at all, the ship left the isle. I was desperate when I found out that my tinkering with the engine had not worked as planned, but I was horrified as the ship exploded shortly after it left. There were no survivors. But I had no choice. They forced me to do it. It was their fault, not mine. It is IT's fault. I will have my revenge. I will avenge those who died today! I will continue with the experiments. \n... Only two others decided to stay here with me to continue the experiments. But I think they are suspicious now after the accident. I will have to be very careful. The ghosts have returned in the night, now joined by those who died on the ship. They are accusing me, mocking me. I must continue, though. I must succeed or everything was in vain.\n... The experiments with the creatures have become more random, less planned. The others stick to the original plans, but with the lack of resources, I have to take chances. Perhaps we will randomly get an advance that would have cost us years of planed breeding. Experiments we see as failures are released into the wilderness. Hopefully this will keep the fishmen away. \n... We are short of food. I will have to rely on eating dead experiments. \n... Rehus was attacked and killed by one of his experiments today. My only concern upon learning this was that he might join the ghosts that haunt me. The captured fishmen seems to be mocking me, too. I know what he is thinking. He thinks that my experiments will fail, that I have been unsuitable to lead such an expedition at all. He seems motionless and untouched when I yell at him, but I know he is snickering when I leave.\n... Failure after failure.\n... No one here to take care of the machines. No one here.\n... Tired. So tired. No idea what Hiona is doing. We rarely speak. I wish she had left with the others. No word from Yalahar. The others. They are dead, aren't they? Something with the ship.",

        "text": "My memoires as dictated by the First Dragon:\nWhen I arrived in the lands of the scaleless, I already had a life of adventures and excitement behind me and so I was looking for a cosy play to stay. Eventually I found a little cave that had just the right size to serve as a small but decent hoard. Also the cave's acoustic would enhance the screams of my victims in a most pleasing way. Young dragons usually prefer a volcanic and hot environment. At my age, however, the heat is relatively harmful for my scales and the sulphuric fumes may lead to spontaneous stomach combustions. The new cave, though, had all the gloom and dankness an old dragon could wish for. Despite the cave's closeness to one of the few human towns that awakened in these days, the younger dragons had passed on because the town lacked a princess who could be kidnapped for amusement. Since I had no nerves for weeping, screaming and sad love stories anyway, the cave was the perfect choice for me, and quite a bargain, I might add.\nBeing a good neighbour, I refrained from burning and plundering the city. However, anyone who entered my lair was fair game of course. Oh and they came! At first there were only a few. The first ones were some farmers looking for a lost chicken. What an irony -  they tasted just the same. In my eagerness for a meal I have to admit I behaved like some newt. I had completely forgotten about my manners and let no one escape. Of course that way no one could spread the word and so it took a while until the next humans stumbled into my realm. Soon a healthy ritual established in which I pretended they had some chance to slay me - then I ate them, occasionally letting escape one.\nWhenever I recognised the flow of adventurers was waning, I invented a new vulnerability to give them some hope. In the years to come I pretended all kinds of things, something amusing like not being able to see through their laughable invisibility spells, something more desperate like pretending to be afraid of flowers or parcels, up to the absurd like acting that I was unable to walk through fire. My human admirers believed it all. They were all great sports and tasted quite well. The surprise on the face of those invisible sorcerers when I finally turned towards them to roast them for dinner -  just priceless. You must have been there to fully appreciate it.\nHowever, too much tin food, like we call those armour-clad humans, is not very healthy for a dragon in the long run. Yes, it's temptingly delicious and easily prepared but molten cheap metal does not go well with stomach acid. Moreover, we all know that one gets fat while being on a human diet.\nAnd fat I got and the stomach problems started. Also my hoard had grown so much that it did not fit into my humble lair anymore. Moreover, all the fights had lost their fun and turned into a tedious chore. So I made up my mind and started looking for a retirement home. A former pal of mine hinted me at an affordable island cave - that was just the place I was looking for.\nI felt bad for my humans, though. Whom should they feed all those pesky heroes to when I was gone? So I asked a dragon clan to move into my cave when I was gone. Only later I learnt that they did a very lousy job. One by one they got killed. Well, the damage was done and it did not really bother me much.\nSince then I've been living a life in peace on a strict no-human diet and I feel healthy and energetic to last for several more centuries.",

        "text": "Geography of Kilmaresh\nEast of the strait that separates Kilmaresh from Krailos, there are mainly dry steppe regions. At the peninsula's centre lies a large mountain range and one will always discover small oases and tombs scattered over the steppe. In addition, there are many rock formations, interveined with blue ore. This ore can be magically crafted into a rare and precious metal that Sapphire Blade members use for their blades. A large river, the Nykri, rises in the central mountains and forms a fork halfway to the sea. Here lies the big city Issavi, the heart of Kilmaresh. The original capital Nuur was destroyed by Suon's Wrath.\nKilmaresh has a warm, dry climate. The temperatures are very high, especially in summer, and it does not rain much. However, this part od the continent is not plagued by the lack of water that crusts the lakes and rivers of Krailos with salt. In addition to the river Nykri, there are oases in the steppe, which house smaller settlements or stations for travellers.\nKilmaresh is mainly populated by humans. They have lived on this continent for several millennia and developed into the high culture, which now forms the eponymous Empire Kilmaresh. In the past, numerous enslaved ogres lived in Kilmaresh, but since Suon's Wrath and the collapse of the old empire, the ogres are found almost exclusively on Krailos. A single tribe still lives north of the ruined city Nuur. In addition, the magical creatures who call themselves the Anuma  live in Kilmaresh since forever. These include sphinxes, manticores, lamassu and griffins.",

        "text": "History of Kilmaresh\nA thousand years ago, a human civilization existed on the then still connected land mass of Krailos and Kilmaresh. They had built large cities, engaged in advanced seafaring and stood at a high scientific, arcane and cultural level. The people worshipped the two sun gods, Suon and Fafnar, and attached great importance to the fact that the worship of both deities was always in balance. However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a civil war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This event was seen as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was believed that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and split in half. While the ogres revolted on Krailos, slew their former masters and destroyed the entire human culture, the empire's remains could be preserved on Kilmaresh and a second, new empire was established. However, this was not achieved by humans, but by the Anuma. The magical beings had lived on Kilmaresh much longer than the humans, but had been very withdrawn and barely maintained contact with the ancient empire. After Suon's Wrath they freed the enslaved ogres and took most of them to Krailos. Then they took control of the new empire and established several laws (carved into a large obelisk) that all humans had to comply with. A wise sphinx, lamassu or gryphon has been taking on the role of empress or emperor ever since. However, the Anuma administrate the realm rather than ruling it.\nAfter the great catastrophe, henceforth just known as \"Suon's Wrath\", Fafnar's worship was banned and prohibited. However, there was still no unity among the humans of Kilmaresh. Some now demanded the sole worship of Suon, while others insisted that there must always be a divine duality. This group believed that the worship of Suon and Fafnar, based on the tradition of the Genesis, had been a delusion from the start as Suon had cast his wild sister out. Instead, they regarded the sea goddess Bastesh as his true, new sister, because Suon had once protected her from Fafnar's jealousy. New religious fights impended due to this question - however, the Anuma intervened immediately. They decreed that both - the sole worship of Suon or Bastesh as well as the worship of both gods together - should be allowed. Only the worship of Fafnar remained prohibited. Nonetheless, a Fafnar cult outlasted in the hiding and is hoping for the return of the Wild Sun for centuries.",

Additionally, there is also the forbidden worship of Fafnar which flourishes in obscurity. Some of the Anuma rather support the sole Suon cult, fearing that a new duality might lead to war again.

However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back.\nAs all Anuma, sphinxes are highly intelligent and allegedly immortal, though they can die by lethal violence. Some of them love riddles, others are more interested in stories, poems or songs. Many sphinxes are benevolent, yet some are rather merciless and dangerous. All of them can be short-tempered if they feel that a human being will not accept their well-meant guidance. Sphinxes are physically powerful but possess inherent magical skills as well. They tend to test the worth of those seeking their help by asking them riddles or intricate philosophical questions.

They are lethal predators which have a preference for human flesh. Manticores devour their victims with triple rows of teeth, leaving behind not even the bones.\nOther than most Anuma, manticores are ferocious and savage. Nonetheless they are intelligent, if not as much as their benign sphinx sisters or gracious lamassu brothers. They have an ancient and lasting rivalry with the gryphons for reasons that are unknown to most mortals. The sages of Kilmaresh are researching this question for centuries but by now every story is just mere speculation. The best theory is that the manticores, favourite Anuma of the sun goddess Fafnar, hate the gryphons as they are Suon's favourite children. When Suon cast his wild sister out, the manticores accepted his sentence as all Anuma did, but bear a grudge against the gryphons ever since.\nManticores roam the vast steppes of Kilmaresh, hunting for prey and defending their territories. Interestingly, they are able to interbreed with common lions. The progeny of such a mating is a special kind of very strong lions with poisonous fangs but they are rarely encountered.",

They live very reclusive and love the high mountain peaks of Kilmaresh. In very rare cases, a gryphon will forge a bond with a human it regards worthy. If this happens, the gryphon will agree to carry the mortal on its back which is considered the highest possible honour by the people of Kilmaresh.\nAs gryphons are Suon's holy animals, the sun god's temples are decorated with gilded gryphon eggs. To get the rare egg shells, chosen members of a temple will undertake a pilgrimage to the gryphon nests high in the Kilmaresh mountains. If they find a pair that recently hatched fledglings, they will offer presents to the parents and ask for the leftover egg shells. Mostly the gryphons benevolently agree and gift their now empty eggs to the human priests. The mortals will bring the egg shells to the respective temple, where the eggs are blessed, gilded on the inside and filled with onyx sand. Mostly they are used to hold incense sticks that are burned in the temples or gravesides.",

The skin colour changes as the creatures mature, with juveniles being blue and adult animals being bright red. Goannas lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but sometimes also inside termite mounds, which offers protection as well as incubation. Additionally, the termites provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Goanna eggs are a sought after meal for the human population of Kilmaresh. But as getting them is a dangerous task, they make a rather expensive menu.\nGoannas are found throughout the steppes of Kilmaresh. They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth.",

Oh, how could I have guessed that I had become a servant of the Benevolent King in the darkest of hours? For Suon's Wrath was already upon the venerable city Nuur, the capital of Kilmaresh was destined to fall. The wisest and most erudite priests came together, and I had the undeserved honor of being called into this high circle. Since many days and nights we are praying now. The suns sank in the west and rose in the east, many times already, without seeing Issavi safe. But today Suon sent us a portent. Tomorrow will see the fate of Kilmaresh.

I struck against the golden gates and shouted: \"O people of the great and mighty Issavi, let me enter the green paradise in the heart of the steppe! My dusty feet are unworthy to touch the white alabaster of your streets. Nor are my lips worthy to taste the sweet water of your wells.

Without the smallest piece of silver, without the most modest ring on the toes of my feet, I come to the gates of the Golden City. But even though I don't hold any riches, I am rich in spirit.

They possess four arms and are able to use all of them simultaneously - be it to fish, weave, wield weapons or perform special gestures called yukti to cast spells. They typically hold their heads and torsos off the ground while moving, but they can increase their speed by lowering their bodies. On their torsos they like to wear beautiful silken clothes or ornate armour as well jewelry like rings, bracelets and bangles on their arms. The lower snake body is usually free of clothing, but will be protected with armour if necessary. Nagas are resistant to poison and have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic. Much like most snake and reptile species, they dislike cold climates.\n\nNagas are an old, powerful and proud race who live on the jungle island Marapur since several millennia and built up a remarkable culture there. Their cities are said to be filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures. Their power makes them potentially dangerous to humans. However, many of them act rather benevolent towards the two-legs, as they call the humanoid races. If they are hostile and aggressive, there is always a good reason, be it obvious or not.",

When nearing the island, high mountains are the first shapes that become visible on the horizon. Lush gras and jungle-like vegetation covers the lowlands. On the coastal lines, the land is partially flooded by water. Small islets surround the island, just like ice floes surround large icebergs. Cause for this partial flooding is the very slowly rising sea level that has been going on for centuries. The island provides the prefect living environment for the Nagas. Nagas are devided into two factions: On the one hand, there are nagas living in the coastal regions. They have integrated the rising sea level perfectly into their way of living. They call it the Rising and take advantage of the moist and watery surroundings rather than trying to prevent any flooding. On the other hand, there are nagas living in the mountains. They have not been affected, yet, by the Rising. Due to the different living conditions, there are some cultural and religious differences between these two groups. The different lifestyle results in different customs, as well as different food preferences. These difference are no reason for any open conflict, though tensions do occur.",

        "text": "As intensely as the orcs hate all other races, they share a feeling of community. The orcs can sense, to some extent, the feelings of other orcs. The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities.",

What's needed is the fire of a fire element, the head of a ghoul,the essence of a red royal blossom, some water from Blood Bay and the laugh of a mute sinner. Light a fire with the flame of the fire element. Pour the water from Blood Bay into a cauldron and place it over the fire. Throw in the head of the ghoul and the essence of the red royal Blossom and mix it untill a grey myst emerges. Take some of the potion and mix it with the laugh while cooling it.

This cult was said to have performed gruesome blood rituals and sacrifices to appease their deity and gain access to its immense power. Some sources claim that this god of blood was responsible for creating the first vampires, imbuing them with his own power and granting them immortality. Others suggest that the cult's rituals were simply an attempt to emulate the power of the blood god, rather than a direct channeling of his power. Regardless of the truth, the cult eventually fell out of favor and its practices were suppressed by the ruling powers of the time. Yet, whispers still persist of secret blood cults that venerate the blood god and seek to tap into its otherworldly power.",

It killed many miners, because that 'snake' was a bassilsk horrible beeing with a gaze that could turn living beeings into stone. Many heroes tried to kill it but none suceeded, some fled, most died.  One day a wise man which name is forgotten. (I did many studies but i looks like for some reason none wrote down his name) He had some knowledge about theese horrible creatures. He advised the miners to cover the minewalls with torches and lamps. Scared by the dispised bright light the basilisk retreated deeper and deeper into the mines until the mines managed to create a cave in behind him. If the miners I talked to did not make fun of me we have to assume that the basilisk is still there...",

The dwarves reacted quick and by valor and superior equipment defeated the raiders. This ensued the War of Welcome. After this incident the dwarves who claimed that the time had come to stand up for their beliefs and their treasure got the proof they needed to convince their brethren and sisters of their cause.  The orcs would not retreat though and prepared themselfes for war. After a year of battle the orcs were finaly crushed and the tribe scattered. The dwarves now again claimed dominance over the heart of the continent and all the land that 'where under the shadow of the big old one'.

        "text": "The principle of opening a gate for a demonic army is the same as summoning a demon. You need to accumulate some critical mass of synergistic energy and open a rift between the worlds. The needed ingredients consist of some of the negative energy that is similar to the essence of the demonic realm.\nThe first part of the summoning ritual opens only a small rift to the demonic realm. Through this rift demonic energy enters into our world infiltrating into the ingredients and filling them with more power. With stronger ingredients, the ritual opens a larger rift this time, letting more demonic energy in to strengthen the ingredients. This ritual is repeated over and over again until the ingredients are strong enough to open a portal through which the demons can pass.\nThis ritual can also be initiated from the demon side. Sightings of Orshabaal and similar entities clearly show all characteristics common for such rituals.\nOnce the gate is open, demonic minions appear and boost the negative energy of the place by their sheer presence. Later, the demonic master is following. His appearance causes a drop of the negative energy as the demon lord is feeding on it to sustain his existence in our realm.\nAs long as there are enough minions to boost the negative energy of a place, demons can exist for a very long time in our realm. So in theory, it would also be possible that the gate between the two realms is kept open, allowing more and more demons to enter our world that can easily form a demonic army causing mayhem and havoc.\nThe archdemon Shervad the Destroyer wore an armor made of an unknown material that allowed him to stay in our realm for at least three centuries. In his last battle, he lost his strength, even though he was not physically hurt - his enemies had destroyed his armor. It is said that the armor was made by some ore found in the old mines.",

        "text": "Elves by Iregarn Pt. 1\nThe elves are able to manipulate their unborn children by some kind of dream magic. This magic changes appearance and personality slightly, allowing elven parents to give birth to 'wish-kids'. In their shared dreams the elven parents seem to sculpture their child like a piece of art. Though most of the dream magic of the past is long forgotten, this rudimentary magic seems to be natural to the elves. It is possible to 'choose' things like hair or eye color and even gender. Even slight changes of the physique are possible, though considerable changes take place in the span of generations. Wise men assume this ability was a 'gift' of the gods to make more adaptable tools for the elves' war. But the mentality of the elves did not allow them to form their children in a 'convenient' way. Since most of this magic is instinctual, they form their children in an aesthetic way. On the other hand, what is seen as aesthetic is based on the philosophy of the parents and so their background changes this view dramatically. This is even more evident in the castes that were separated in the war.",

        "text": "The Dark Woman III\nStumbling out of the mausoleum, he found himself in the ruins of a once-proud city. It did not take him long to realise that these ruins were the remnants of his own capital. It appeared that he had lain in an unholy slumber for a very long time. And now his kingdom was lost, run over by his enemies, and his former subjects were enslaved or dead.\nStunned with shock and disbelief, he wandered aimlessly through the ruins. To his own amazement, however, his heart did not race as furiously as might have been expected. In fact, it did not beat at all. Stricken by panic and confusion, the king went on and on until he came across a small group of travellers, who had sought refuge in the ruined city. The meeting was not a coincidence because he had felt their presence for quite some time and purposefully directed his steps towards them. In fact, all of a sudden a hunger had taken hold of him such as he had never experienced before. He rushed towards the strangers as fast as he could, his mind inexplicably clouded by this weird hunger. When he finally returned to his senses, the travellers lay dead before him, their bodies twisted and mutilated. He was confused and aggrieved to find that the only living beings he could have asked about what had happened were dead, but at the same time he felt strangely intoxicated by a feeling of mad triumphalism. The weird hunger that had troubled him was nearly gone and he felt stronger and more alive than he had ever done before. He fled the city that very night, running away from his painful memories. He made it his habit to travel only by night as he found that daylight caused him insufferable pain.\nToday, little is known of his fate or of what is driving the creature that once was a king. Some say the demon he devoured has taken control of this new form, while others claim that the accursed king is driven by guilt, looking for redemption from the sins he committed against his people, distorted though his vision of redemption might be. Yet another group of scholars claims that the accursed king is bent on revenge against the dark gods who plotted his downfall or perhaps against the gods of light who let him down in the hour of need. What is certain, though, is that he fathered many others like him who share his curse, and that he has lived longer than any mortal creature should, enduring the aeons and watching the ever changing world frozen forever in the moment of death that did not lead to true death.",

        "text": "The Dark Woman II\nHowever, the demon that was his wife was not prepared to give in. She began using her dark powers to entrance him whenever he lay down to sleep. That way, she managed to secretly drink his blood to sap away his strength. Having fallen out of the true gods' favour because of his sins and excesses, he had grown vulnerable to the darkness, and he could not free himself of the evil that had befallen him. With every day that final battle grew nearer and nearer the king grew weaker and weaker. And yet not all was lost. The king was still in his prime and his strong will, which was without equal among mortals, kept him going. For a while it looked as if he might be able to turn the tide and to lead his armies to victory even in his weakened state. It was then the accursed thing that posed as his loving wife made a fatal mistake. Having become desperate or perhaps simply overwhelmed by greed, she took too much of her husband's life force, revealing her dark nature at last. As the spell that lain upon him for so many years broke and the king awoke from his dark slumber, he surprised the thing he had thought to be his loving wife feeding on his very blood. In a heartbeat the veil of years of deception was torn, and the once-proud king saw the terror that had befallen him for what it was.\nHis despair knew no bounds. Blinded by feelings of rage and guilt, he slew the accursed creature that was neither demon nor man with a single mighty stroke. When he saw the unholy creature whom he had loved so desperately lying in her blood he sunk unhappily to the floor. He wept with sorrow and despair, while outside the drums were beaten and the trumpets of war were sounded. The generals came and tried to call him to battle, but he would not move. Tortured by feelings of remorse and guilt and hate and despair, his mind was close to madness for a long time. Eventually, an idea took hold of his mind that defied sanity. If his strength had been taken from him by stealing his blood, could he not get it back by drinking his accursed wife's blood? And laughing madly, he turned to drinking the dark blood that had poured from the shattered beast.\nAlas! His hope was in vain. The tainted blood weakened his body instead of making him stronger. Before he knew it, he had passed out. However, when he awoke, he seemed to be strangely invigorated. Feeling ten times stronger than he had ever felt in his life, he tried to get up, only to find that he was surrounded by complete darkness. The air was stale and cold, and not a sound was to be heard. Mustering up all his strength, he pushed against the low ceiling of his stony prison and managed to lift the lid. When his eyes had accustomed to the twilight he realised that he lay in a dusty mausoleum. Stunned and bewildered, the king rose. Everything around him was marked by time and decay.",

        "text": "The Dark Woman I\nIn the olden days there lived a king that was unlike any other king amongst humankind before and after him, except for the divine Banor himself. His light shone upon his subjects and gave them enlightenment.\nThe dark gods looked at him in malice and hatred, but he was blessed and protected by the gods, and nobody could harm him. The dark gods were furious. They held council and discussed how the good king could be undone. Finally, they came up with a diabolical plan. They took a thousand mortal slaves as well as the most vile and cunning of their succubus demons and went to create an entirely new being. They created a woman and sent her into the realm of the great king. She was human by all appearance, but she was evil to the core.\nHer exquisite body and her soft voice were of unsurpassed beauty. She was met with rapture and admiration wherever she went, and many a man lost his heart merely by looking into her gentle eyes that seemed oh so innocent. Soon the king himself had heard of her breathtaking beauty. Intrigued, he summoned her to his court. Nobody was surprised when he fell for the graceful girl the minute he cast his eyes on her. Within a day he proposed to her, against his counsellors' better advice, and within a week the kind king had made the pale, dark-haired beauty his queen.\nThe king was madly in love. He soon accepted his newly-wed wife as his confidante, preferring her opinions over those of his former counsellors. At first it seemed that her advice was thoughtful and prudent, and so it came the good king relied more and more on his beautiful wife's opinion. He closed his eyes and ears to other people's good advice and blindly followed her evil counsel. Little did he realise that she purposefully taint his views of the world with darkness. Using honeyed words, she sowed the seed of distrust in his ear, until he started seeing enemies everywhere. He grew suspicious of his advisers, who dared to challenge his beloved wife's wisdom, and turned away from his former friends, who tried in vain to warn him of her wicked influence. In the end, he even started questioning the authority of the true gods themselves, blinded by his wife's promises of power and glory. She made him believe that the country needed a firm hand and a more determined, efficient rule, flattering his vanity by envisioning the immortal fame he could win as such a glorious king and warrior. The enthralled king followed her advice, not realising that he was about to lead his country into tyranny.\nHe became greedy and ambitious, extending his privileges wherever he felt it necessary. He grew more removed from subjects every day, indulging in feasts and orgies while his people suffered. While his armies struggled in futile, pointless wars he chose to stay behind, claiming that he owed it to his people remain alive rather than to risk his skin on the battlefield. In fact, he very much preferred to indulge in debauchery, surrounding himself with flatterers and sycophants, and there was no greater joy for him to impress emissaries from other countries with the splendour of his palace and, above all, the breathtaking beauty of his wife.\nHowever, the good life was not to last. The tides of war turned against his leaderless armies, which had never failed to win the day when he had lead them himself. After a series of disastrous defeats, a decisive battle became more and more inevitable, and the king finally realised the danger that he and his whole country faced. Remembering the man he used to be, he finally decided to lead his forces. The queen protested. She wailed and threatened and begged him on his knees, but for once he would not listen to her. For a last fleeting moment it looked like all was not lost for the good king and his realm.",

Place the ingredients into a flask of the mad mage valley water, cork it and boil it. Remove the cork and pour a small amount of the potion into a cup and shake it. Now we have to find out how to bring in the silence gefore dawn in an appropriate way. You should then have a full cup of beer if all works as calculated so far. We estimate one potion should be a weeks suply of beer if you minimize your drinking to 7 mugs a day.\n(Oh, and don't tell jimbin about this spell)\nThose are the findings.

It is said when enraged these dwarve's eyes grew in light that could be seen a towns distance away and they went into a bezerk frenzy killing all that opposed them. Loosing all control and compassion in that frenzy they became unbearable even to the fellowsships of the savage axes and the dragoneaters. So after great debates between the fellowships they left Kazordoon and the big old one for unknown new lands. Though some setteled at remote spots on the continent the trail of the others was lost.

        "text": "Vampire Hunter's Handbook I\nThe vampire is a beast created by evil, a parasite that needs the blood of the living to sustain his own parody of life. It is also a plague that spreads quickly if not fought by adequate means.\nA vampire is no longer a living being. When turning into a vampire the soul of the former living being is destroyed and with it also its emotions and certain values. They are replaced by something evil and malignant. Where there was love, there is now desire; where there was valour, there is now cold-heartedness. Every positive aspect of life is transformed into a mockery, just like the whole vampire is a mockery of life.\nThe bite of a vampire is infectious. Sometimes, the now poisoned blood spreads through the body of the victim and raises it from the dead as a new vampire. This happens mostly when the vampire drains the victim slowly of it's blood.\nThere are cases in which a vampire visited its victim over several weeks or even months, slowly stealing their strength and leaving their evil stigma. Such victims raise much more likely as a vampire than victims that were robbed of there blood in a few minutes.\nA vampire depends on the blood of others. If a vampire is not able to drink blood on a regular basis, it will wither and dry out, until it finally crumbles into dust.\nVampires are nocturnal creatures. They fear the sunlight because it evaporates the tainted and stolen blood in their veins. Sunlight greatly accelerates the process which lets vampires dry out. Only a well-fed vampire is able to resist the sunlight for a while.\nThe senses of a vampire are sharpened similar to those of predatory beasts. Still, just like these beasts, it is possible to chase them with the appropriate skills. Garlic, for example, is able to overload a vampire's senses. For this reason, vampires avoid garlic whenever possible.\nVampires also seem to have a special bond to certain animals. Wolves, rats and bats are often found in the company of a vampire. They are even able to shapeshift in such an animal. As the transformation into a bat is the most common one among vampires, it is assumed that it is also the most natural one for them.\nOther animals, however, are rather scared by vampires. Horses sense vampires very easily and express great fear near a vampire's grave.\nEven though vampires usually keep their human appearance, they share the physical strength of other undead. By applying this strength more conscious than other undead they are even more powerful. Their unliving body is able to withstand a large amount of damage, depending on the amount of blood that they've consumed recently. The body rather soaks the damage than to repel it. This can probably be explained with vampires being rather shadows than true bodies, for the same reason they lack a mirror image. However, it is said that vampires can manipulate the mind of others, making them believe that they see a reflection.\nSome vampires are able to use this shadowy state of their body to become a cloud of darkness that is completely invulnerable to physical damage. However, all reports of using this special ability tell about very old vampires. It seems that vampires grow more and more powerful with each decade or century they live their undead lives.",

        "text": "I've been hunting vampires since the days your grandfather's grandfather was an infant. So you better listen to me, otherwise you might end up dead. Even if you listen to me, there is a good chance that those beasts will get you. I don't care why there are vampires and when they came here. The only thing that matters is that we will outlive them!\nDon't think about them in terms of beings. They're nothing than beasts, trust me. They are cunning and deceptive, but still beasts.\nDon't fall for their nonsense of being the rulers of the night. There is no dark curse, it was their own choice to become a vampire. They feed on humans because they are placing their own stinking existence above all else, and as I said, this was their own choice.\nVampires came to the mining colony in which I was living with my family. There were many of them, they were clever, they knew how to use magic, and they wielded dangerous weapons. My people had nothing. They killed some to still their thirst for blood, and many just for fun. We fought them in the tunnels, armed only with a few tools. At last we managed to let the tunnel collapse to kill the majority of us. This way they were at least no longer able to use us as source to satisfy their thirst for blood.\nIt was my curse to survive. It took me three days to dig myself out of the tunnel. Then I was found by the inquisitors that were chasing the vampires. I stayed with them for a while, accompanying them on their vampire hunts. But they were humans and their lives were short, so they attended other matters at some point. I left them and joined other hunters, and travelled the world.\nI have killed my share of vampires in all those years, some weak, some strong. I learnt to fight, I learnt to run, I learnt their weaknesses, and I learnt their strengths.\nWhenever you think you know all about a trade, you learn something new. If you fail to learn, you'll die. I've known many good people that died while hunting vampires. It took a few hundred years until I considered myself as quite good in this trade.\nThere is one weakness all vampires have in common: they're cowards. They proved this already when choosing the life of a vampire instead of facing the feared death. They prove this at each sundown when they rise again instead of ending their miserable existence. They prefer to spread their curse than to stop it. Selfishness is their main motive. Even though they form packs just like other beasts, they know no loyalty or support when danger arises.\nListen, I'm supposed to train you in the art of vampire hunting. But that's not how it works. If you are a fool, I cannot train you to be a genius. I suppose you know how to fight, else they would not have sent you. To learn the tricks of my trade, arm yourself with a blessed stake and hunt some vampires. Bring me their dust to prove your worthiness.",

        "text": "The Shadows of the Vampires\nThe vampire plague had its origin in mortals dabbling with the dark arts.\nIn the wake of the Corpse War, several humans began practising forms of necromancy for one reason or another.\nSome saw the seemingly overwhelming powers of the undead and desired them for themselves. Others desperately tried to discover some countermeasures for the undead threat.\nResearching for either good or evil, a small cabal of people studying necromancy became infected or cursed, slowly turning them into ghouls themselves. The change was slow enough for the necromancer fledglings to try to avert this change with any means possible. They came up with several methods, mostly based on alchemy. At long last they turned distilled human blood mixed with several forbidden ingredients of demonic origin into an effective potion. Not only did the potion end the rotting transformation, it also revitalised the drinker, making him feel healthier and stronger than ever before. It seemed to be an immediate success.\nAfter the entire cabal received the 'cure' it quickly became obvious that the success was only temporal at best. Soon they began feeling weak. Human food offered them nourishment no more. Again and again they were forced to revert to their potion. Trying desperately to find a permanent cure, they varied the original formula, to no avail.\nTwo of the brightest minds of the cabal finally joined efforts in their research, refusing to let others participate. This slowed them down in their experiments. At long last they came up with a theory that the blood of one of their 'kind' just might be the cure they need.\nInstead of carefully draining themselves and exchanging the blood, they started an argument over who should be the first to be cured. Soon the argument got out of hand, resulting in a fight about who had made the discovery and who deserved the praise. A fight of words turned into a fight of fists, one of them ended up dead and the unwilling donor of the much needed blood.\nThe survivor indeed felt cured, even better than before. He disclosed his research to his fellow necromancers, declaring the death of his colleague an accident. The others were too interested in the cure to truly care, eager to be cured themselves. Though blood was gathered and exchanged it did little to cease the transformation, let alone stop it. The 'cured' necromancer soon figured out the blood had to be taken from a living donor in such a mass and speed that the victim would surely die.\nSecretly he shared this knowledge with his most trusted brethren. They slew the others by night. After the initial shock the victims fought back. More than half of the cabal met its demise in this fight. Only few escaped, doomed to become nearly mindless ghouls.\nThe others learnt soon enough that the supposed cure only stabilised their semi-undead state in some way. Though no longer dependent on complicated alchemical potions, they knew that only the blood of the living would quench their thirst. Also, they were able to infect their victims with some strange strain of their own illness, making them the first true vampires with the attributes and vulnerabilities that are known to us today. It was not possible to recreate the original illness or curse that in combination with several not documented potions initially turned the cabal into unliving things.",

Brog possessed only little of his fathers wisdom, and the heat of his mother burned only deep inside of him. There however the fire became more ravaging and more hurting, and the rough titan raged and cried that the elements were shaken. Inexpressible pain troubled him, until the blocheaded Brog compacted his magical powers and hurled a major part of the fire far away from himself. From the fire, which did not want to cool down, however immediately the first dragon, called Garsharak, rose and he bore many further lower dragons in the course of the centuries from his fire and his magic, of the like we know today.",

As Zathroth laughed loudly, in his vain triumph, he did not understand their words, and so the secret of creation and life stayed hidden from him forever.\nThey however wove the fleeting elements to powerful strands. Althought they did not succeed in uniting them again but the individual parts became something new, the first real creation. Thus the living part became Tibia, born from the element earth, Sula became the sea washing around it. Air rose over the creation and layed itself like a protecting blanket over the creation, and the fire seeped under it and began to warm it up.\nBehold: Each of the separate parts of the god was full of life and divinity! But none of the elements possessed the spirit of the Tibiasula, but they were wild and impetuous, following always the impulses which corresponded to their nature.",

Many men have fallen in love with one of them, bewitched by their beauty and magic. Fortunately, mermaids are easily distracted and lose any interest in their enthralled victims as soon as something or someone else draws the attention. Since this is often enough another man that was foolish enough to get close to them, one elflock-stricken victim is replaced with another one. It is almost impossible to escape this vicious circle since unbanning one victim often means to sacrifice another man's live or at least his freedom.",

From there, they plot their raids on the surface in which they cause havoc and mayhem. The quara consist of several subspecies whose relation to each other is still unknown to men. Given their hostile disposition, it is unlikely that we will ever learn more about them. For most humans it is sufficient to know that a quara means danger. Those who are able to fight them should kill them, those who are too weak should avoid them by all means.",

With the help of magic and breeding, they refined the very essence of all creatures on the isle. So even the animals became incredibly healthy and practically perfect beings of their species. They even acquired some intelligence that improved from generation to generation. After a catastrophe that destroyed the whole island, only a few of those animals survived. Over the years, other animals added to these special creatures, and soon only a fraction of the animals still had the attributes of their ancestors.\nThese noble animals chose one of their kind as their king and with the knowledge of their ancestors they acquired immortality. Nowadays, those animal kings still live at remote places, though some of them might have left the isles for more hospitable areas.\nIf someone  succeeds in catching one of them, he might learn their secret of immortality along with other secrets that were thought to be lost with the destruction of the isle.",

They created many powerful items which they used to bend the other races to their own will. One day though, they decided to build a device that allowed them to look into the realm of the gods. The gods became aware of this blasphemy, hence they sent a messenger to the Shapers. It was Huodin, the blessed servant of Kurik, who warned them not to cross the line. The vain Shapers, however, were mocking him and chased him away. Then the gods sent a second messenger. Anadron, the voice of Uman-Zathroth, brought them the wisdom to abandon their false ways. The Shapers, however, denied him entry and discarded the wisdom, casting it into the deepest well in one of their cities.\nThen the gods sent Dratur, the adamant sword of Banor. He just walked into their capitol and stood there without any motion, without saying a word, his weapons sheathed. At first the Shapers were fearful, but soon they began to mock the unmoving warrior. Three and three days he stood there while the artefact of the Shapers was almost finalised.\nAs the project was just a few heartbeats away from completion, Dratur drew his sword, blessed by all the gods. In three and three minutes he had slain the entire city. Every Shaper older than three and three years lay dead in their accursed blood. When Dratur sheathed his sword, the gods let fire, toxic slime and brimstone rain upon the cities of the blasphemous Shapers for three and three days.",

After some singing, dancing and drinking, they started to jump through some of the bonfires. They started screaming insanely and then started to walk over glowing logs of wood. I am wondering if this has something to do with the stuff they are drinking. It would be interesting to see if it can be used to cross lava streams.",

It is known that pirates tend to hide their treasures on deserted islands for some unknown reason. They just bury them on some remote place and then forget about them. This similarity to the behaviour of squirrels was never scientifically verified. However, since pirates love to dress lightly they also love the south. Therefore, it is only natural that they hide their treasures there. Some of the southern isles are so popular among pirates that there is hardly any free space left to bury new treasure.\nIf anyone ever is looking for treasures, then those isles are the best place to start with.",

I suppose this is the mysterious way deeper into the caves we sought after for so long. But Harry, the coward, didn't dare to dive into the water.

Although they can 'speak' like humans using some membranes, their native 'tongue' consists of a blinking code with each eye, where a blinking could mean some syllable, letter or word. It is by far the most complex speech we have ever encountered and it is almost impossible to comprehend. As far as we can tell it is not only a language but also some kind of mathematics. This combination makes it tedious even to try to understand that language.\nThe books the bonelords write contain only numbers and the code behind them is incredibly complex. This race was one of those which were part in the creation wars and therefore its peak of civilization and power is long gone. There are rumours about still existent bonelord settlements where they try to improve their unspeakable necromantic rituals and create an army of undead.\nIn general they seem malicious but without any ambition to do more than to claim some lairs and to defend them. They seem to have no ambitions in conquering or allying with other races in a bigger style other than bonelord mercenaries who occasionally join forces with other entities for private reasons.",

They argue that the sheer concept of souls from 'beyond' entering our realm is by all means very random and could not be planned at all. They suggest that it's a lot more likely that the vortex was actually some damage that was caused to the fabric of reality. Through this hole in reality souls that were never meant to be entered our realm and, so they assume, it's additionally a leak that leaches away the power of the gods. They suggest that war for creation was NOT interrupted\nbecause the gods wanted to heal the wounds of the world, but because this powerleak frightened them that much. They further speculate that the withdrawel of the world was more an act of panic, an attempt not to lose complete control over\ncreation, and the process known as awakening is by no means the working of benevolence, but the gods losing grip of the things they tried to hide away from the intruding souls. The theory goes that as there is an ascension for the souls from beyond to achieve some form of godhood, there is a constant descent for the powers of the gods of old due to the power that is leaking away into nothingness and the power the living claim for their own. Of course this heresy is very popular in the ranks of certain ascension cults. More so since it takes care of the more common fear in those conclaves, that the jealous gods may strike back\non those who try the ascension.",

        "text": "The Lair of Xemal Xoth\nLiches are creatures of power that instill terror even in the hearts of the bravest heroes. The lich Xemal Xoth was one of the more notorious of his kind. He was superior to most of the liches and several of them had to follow his orders. In his early days, he enslaved the whole area of Drefia. He reigned supreme until a fraction of the liches tried to overthrow him. They were defeated and put to eternal torment as a warning to enemies and minions alike. Still the forces of Xemal Xoth were weakened and his ranks thinned out. Seizing that opportunity, a mighty circle of necromancers attacked Drefia and the lich had only a narrow escape. Seeking refuge in the pyramid city of Ankrahmun, he served under the Pharaoh and God-King Arkhothep as an advisor and court magician. But serving did not suit the taste of the vain lich and after some years he left the city to follow his own dark agenda. It was at this time when he secretly started to construct his lair. At first it served as a depot for the knowledge and treasures he had rescued from Drefia and acquired in Ankrahmun. Later he began to station his most powerful undead guardians and creations there. Still he was looking for some other centre for his power. A place where he would reign supreme once more. But by and by, his efforts concentrated on his secret lair with which for some unknown reason he became more and more obsessed with. He waged an half-hearted attempt to overrun Darashia with the aid of a handful of vampire lords and their minions. But after the tides of battle turned against them and seemed to favour the pious citizens of Darashia and the heroes that came to help, he abandoned Darashia without further thought. Several other incidents, involving undeads from all over the known world, can be traced back to Xemal Xoth but none of them seemed serious enough to pose a real threat. As the construction of his lair made further progress, he withdrew more and more from the world. So it is no wonder that his name has almost been forgotten today. The motives of Xemal Xoth can only be guessed, but they are certainly nothing good for the people of Tibia. Whatever he is concocting in his lair, it can only be hoped for that he is stopped before he succeeds in his evil plans.\nThe search for him, however, appears to be almost impossible since no living being seems to know where to find that secret lair. It can only be guessed that he learnt about some place of power and somehow keeps it under control. There are no real clues that can help us in this matter.",

        "text": "The liberators of the spark by Sericos\nAlso known as liberators of light and several similar names this Banor sect is dedicated to the so called 'liberation of the godly spark' from the unworthy. In theory they agree upon the doctrine of the Banor cult that each human and probably some of the non-human races are born with a part of the divine essence in them. Whereas other cults are dedicated to make this spark flourish for the good of the individual or civilisation, the liberators argue that certain persons are not worthy of the godly spark and it is better to set the divine essence free by killing them in ritual combat. Certain splintergroups of the liberators go even further and claim that a person can claim the divine essence of those slain to strengthen themselves. So this heresy led to two equally dangerous and forbidden subsects of the banor cult. While the original heretics killed only criminals after their foundation, the term 'unworthy' soon became more widely defined, and they began to slay cowards and everyone they considered weak. The so-called 'new liberators' brought this heresy to another equally mad degree. They argue that if you can claim the divine spark of others by killing them you should not target the weak, but the mighty. They 'honor' their victims in duels and admittedly more then one new liberator met his well deserved end at the swordtip of an opponent far superior to him. Still there ARE a considerable number of new liberators around and doing their perverted work for their god. The church of Banor in turn has outlawed both heresies and affiliation with either of those sects is punished with lifelong laborcamp or execution.",

It was our goal to reach the haunted ruins of Drefia using small boats that would allow us to stay close to the beach which had some major advantages: while exploring the coastline we could gather food and water in the jungle and avoid the dangers of the treacherous reefs of the northern coast at the same time.\nOf course this would still be a dangerous and daring enterprise - else it would have been done before -, but we were sure that it could be done. Indeed the voyage started smoothly. We grew accustomed to the difficulties of the coastline quite fast and none of the giant sea creatures that were rumoured to plague the reefs were sighted. The first actual threats we faced were quite ordinary beasts of the jungle which - although dangerous - did not turn out to be of greater danger than the animals we had encountered during other travels. However we did not expect at all the very jungle to turn against us. We were setting up camp on a clearing that seemed peaceful, even idyllic. With hindsight this fact should have alerted us, but we were exhausted from a lengthy trip and relieved to get some rest without having to drive some beasts away first. All of a sudden, thorns shot all over the clearing and the previously calm jungle ground came to violent life. Plants we had never seen before were biting our feet with the ferocious greed of a rabid hyaena. Complete disorientation and panic took over and there was yelling and running everywhere. When we finally made it back to the boats, most of the equipment we had carried with us was lost and there was no one among us who was not injured, some were even poisoned. We spent a hard night directly on the beach and woke up drenched, covered with sand and salt all over, our wounds burning like fire. Yet we decided to continue our expedition.",

We reached an area where the reefs made it almost impossible to stay close to the shore and thus forced us to make a decision. We could either try to continue our voyage through the treacherous reefs by boat, or head for deeper water and travel across the dangerous ocean for an indefinite time or, as third alternative, continue by foot along the beach with the boats on our backs until it seemed safe enough to use the boats again. Under normal circumstances I would have opted for the latter, but me and my men were wounded and tired and the jungle had already shown us its ugly face in a way which made none of us want to see more of it. Heading for the ocean was no real option either. Not only that our small boats were not built for that kind of travel - reaching Drefia via the high seas had already been accomplished before and doing so would contradict the intention of the whole expedition. Thus we dared to stick to our original plan as closely as possibly and to try finding a path through the reefs. Shortly after we were rewarded for our bravery with a breathtaking sight.",

Already half taken over by the all-devouring jungle vegetation but still clearly recognisable there was an actual city - ancient, but obviously populated. Having heard about the pyramids of the southern desert we instinctively related the jungle monuments to the same culture and to the people settling in the city of Ankrahmun. While we cautiously steered our boats closer to the beach and wondered about the mysterious origins of this jungle city, more and more apes showed up on the beach, yelling at us in threatening poses. Strangely enough, they were wearing various kinds of equipment - actually wearing it, not randomly strapped to the body like some mindless beast might have done. Due to the obvious hostility we stayed far enough from them to avoid the coconuts and stones they hurled in our direction. I was left solely with the option to examine the strange apes and the ruins through my spyglass and was able to spot different kinds of apes which wore sparse clothing and equipment such as weapons in a way that made clear they knew what they were doing. However some - if not most - equipment looked odd on them, as if made for creatures of a completely different build. A closer look at the ruins revealed that they were not as ruined as I had thought at first, in fact most were only overgrown by the jungle. The visible remains displayed impressive work and art. Oddly, most patterns on the walls showed serpents and lizards of some kind which for sure did not fit the hairy humanoids inhabiting the city. Then I saw the first statues. Although obviously damaged on purpose and turned into almost unrecognisable heaps of stone, some of them showed features of two legged, upright walking lizards complete with weaponry and other equipment. Instantly I remembered the stories of intelligent, yet savage lizard men which were rumoured to live somewhere in the deepest jungle.",

We decided to take a break and set up camp, even more careful than usual, securing it with everything we had at our disposal since we needed some time to repair our boats and equipment as well as to heal our wounds. We camped there for two days and - thanks to the gods - had to face only minor nuisances. During the night the same jungle which could turn dangerously silent in the daytime became a symphony of screams, screeches and howls of creatures no one of us could even imagine. When the sun set, the sky seemed to explode with massive rain as if the gods were pouring down a whole ocean on us. Even with our full equipment we would have had a hard time to keep ourselves comfortable and with a significant amount of our stuff lost to the jungle, it was almost impossible to actually recover. As we took off for the sea again we were all glad to escape this green hell once more. We followed the shoreline to the next impassable reef formation, however, this time the reefs were close to the beach, so it was easy enough to find a way around while keeping the land in sight as well as avoiding the depths of the sea. Using my spyglass, a wooden structure blending almost perfectly with the jungle caught my attention. It reminded me of an enormous fortification of some sort, yet there seemed to be no defenders, just thickest jungle surrounding it.",

        "text": "My Travels by Ploch Pridestride (Volume 21)\nSince there was no reasonable possibility to reach this structure at this time or even just the shore, we continued our voyage through the night. It was about midnight when a roar of some sort interrupted the cacophony of the jungle, and then silence remained. The waves of the sea and their gentle lapping against our wooden boats were the only sounds still audible. From what I can tell, the cause of this roar must have been something we had never encountered before. We had seen and heard dragons, even the majestic dragon lords, but this had to be something which would dwarf even them. I am not ashamed to admit that my hands were trembling when I took my spyglass and searched the night for any sight of the creature we had just heard. Of course I did not really hope to actually spot something in this darkness, so again I was more than surprised when I indeed detected a shadow moving through the jungle. I hardly could have overlooked it since it towered even above the giant trees of the jungle. I was not able to see anything more of it than its rough shape, but for all that I saw I swear to the gods it was the shape of some brutish humanoid. No one of us felt prepared to investigate this mystery in that night, and as the sun rose once again we had already left the sandy part of the coastline and followed the jagged mountain range which seperated Drefia from the rest of the continent. Our destination was near.",

        "text": "The Lizard People\nIt seems the lizards we encountered in the jungle are some sort of civilised culture. When I speak of culture, I relate them only to primitive orcs and minotaurs of course. During our expeditions to the jungle we learned that they are hostile to humanity like most of the vile creatures of this new land. Their animosity also spreads to most other races we encountered here. They seem to be a warlike race, searching for conflicts and fights with each and everyone they encounter. Obviously this mindless aggression leaves little room to develop a culture like the human one, achieved due to a long history. It is unlikely those primitive brutes even know the very concept of history at all.\nThis leaves one to wonder who supplies them with their exotic weaponary and armor. Perhaps they are some minor race of a greater dark power that lurks in the deepest depths of the jungle. The magic I have seen performed by those lizards was far from impressive. They use a very limited variety of shamanistic tricks that are insignificantly more powerful than the powers those average orcish hive shamans hold.\nTo sum things up, the lizard people are another hostile race that might be seen as a hindrance for humankind but they do not pose a threat. On the other hand they are of no use to us and a timely elimination could only be helpful.",

For all we know it is quite certain that there have to be other dangers in the jungle than such mundane ones. How can it be explained that several watchmen of expeditions have vanished over night while none of the people asleep in the camp was harmed? How is it possible that well armed and seasoned adventurers got lost in the jungle? Considering the expertise of some of the victims this jungle has taken, it would be highly ignorant to assume that a simple beast of some kind could be the source of their ultimate doom. In conclusion we have to assume that 'something' is out there. A malicious, unseen power. Never seen but often felt. Noticed only by the 'inner eye' but never actually seen. Everybody that has ever set foot in the jungle knows this eerie feeling of being watched and traced. Sometimes you can almost imagine the movements of something invisible in the bushes.\nAnd do all those glowing eyes in the darkness belong to animals? I don't think so.",

        "text": "The Pyramids of the Apes Vol. 1\nHaving experienced the apes as a very primitive culture, the rumors and stories about them living in a pyramid city, not unlike that of the far away Ankrahmun, seemed unbelivable at first. On second thought though we have to admit that we have seen stranger things than this in our lovely world. But how could those primitive apes build a pyramid city like this? How could they aquire such heights of architecture while they can hardly wield a weapon and have only a remote grasp to the concept of clothing? The answer is quite obvious though.\nWe know that the pyramid architecture of Ankrahmun has been used for its spiritual value long before the reign of Arkhotep. We also know that Ankrahmun is a city of the dead. As a matter of fact it is also true that in Ankrahmun the wisdom of many ages has been gathered and philosophy and science prospered like nowhere else in this world. It is obvious that the pyramids are linked to death and to wisdom somehow. If you put two and two together, you can easily figure out that those pyramids act as a collector of spiritual energy and probably even literally as houses of the dead. Imagine a civilisation that could have conversations with its dead ancestors and draw from the enormous source of their wisdom! Would such a civilisation not prosper like that of Ankrahmun? For sure it would.\nBut how is this connected to the apes and their pyramids one might ask. The answer is simple: being the primitive beings they are, the apes are unable to build such structures but some spirits of the past with the wisdom of millennia might have that knowledge. We all know that a primitive mind can be easily controlled. So it would be easy for such a spirit to take over control of the simple mind of one or more apes and give them orders. Without knowing what they were doing such mind-controlled apes could have built this city of pyramids. Of course the apes would have no need for such a city, but surely the ghosts or spirits would like to call such a place their home.",

        "text": "The Pyramids of the Apes Vol. 2\nAfter obtaining their base, the spirits must have stopped controlling the apes which resulted in random raids that are too well known by the inhabitants of Port Hope and that formed their opinion about those creatures. The lack of organisation and control in those attacks makes it obvious that there is no higher power behind them. It seems that the spirits have now left the pyramids since the rare reports we receive from that place, tell us that the once grand structures are now overgrown ruins. Would the spirits allow their home to decay in such a way? I would highly doubt that. There are only two explanations for this phenomenon. The first possibility is that the spirits have left our world. This would be reasonable if you assume that taking control over a living being costs some powers and might have drained all energy from the spirits. But wouldn't those pyramids cancel this effect? For sure they would. So another reason for the spirits' departure could be that the spirits gathered enough energy through the pyramids that allowed them to travel to another dimension or reach a new state of being (or death). So the spirits have no use of the pyramids anymore. The second theory for the spirits' disappearance is much more worrying: the spirits are only asleep. Perhaps the process of becoming one with the field energy of the pyramids was so exhausting that the spirits had to take some rest. If this is the case, they could wake up anytime. And nobody can foresee how they will react to us living intruders who could pose a dangerous threat to their spiritual home.",

These ropes are especially useful when it comes to simple constructions that only have to last for a short period of time.\nThe jungle dweller bush is quite a common plant. It's the home of a variety of insects and small animals.\nThe green wig bush is mainly known for its long, threadlike roots. Although those roots are edible it is not advisable to actually do so. They have an extreme bitter taste and need to be boiled to reach an edible state. The green wig bush got his name from the sad fact that sometimes the murderous dworcs use its roots to bind them to their heads as some kind of camouflage during their sneak attacks.\nThe lizards tongue is quite an unremarkable plant. It grows quickly but there is no real use for this resource and it does not please the eye enough to be worth growing it. It can be easily recognised by the slimy coating of its leaves which partly led to its name.\nThe jungle crown is somewhat rare. Still it's quite an unremarkable plant considering its majestic name which probably originates from its unique ringlike growth pattern.\nIt is unknown if the name of the green fountain bush was chosen deliberately or rather accidentally, but the name is well to the point for two reasons. Firstly, it does indeed resemble a frozen green fountain and secondly, like a cactus it is able to accumulate a substantial supply of water in its thick leaves.",

Probably the first explorers were shocked when they first saw the thick round blossoms of this giant flower. Obviously, those explorers knew little about dragons and even less about plants, naming it a tree.\nThe purple kiss bush is a plant that pleases the eye and the nose alike. Sadly it seems impossible to cultivate it yet and so we have to live with the fact that we will only meet its beauty by chance.\nThe jungle umbrella in its many varieties is extremly common and only the fertility of the other jungle plants prevents it from becoming a pest. It grows faster than bamboo but lacks its usefulness. Its wood is thin and breaks easily when dried.\nOn touch the chill nettle injects a very mild poison that let the skin feel somewhat numb and cold. Although some people try using it to fight the heat, it actually does not prevent overheating and also the production of sweat is not reduced. Given the threat of possible long-term damage, it's not advisable to use the nettle for this purpose.\nThe monkey tail plant is most likely related to the chill nettle. It is also possible that one plant is disguising the other one for some unknown reason. Before the monkey tail blooms, the two plants almost look alike. Only when the monkey tail reveals its purple blossom does the difference become obvious, even to an amateur.\nThe fairy queen is one of the most beautiful plants in the whole world. Unfortunately it needs an insane effort to grow them away from their natural habitat. To grow one, expensive supplies and a group of specialists are needed that only kings and queens could afford. Therefore, the fairy queen will only be found in company that fits her royal title.",

        "text": "Wondrous Plant Life - Jungle Edition Vol. 3\nEven though, one could assume that the crane plant obtained its name because it looks remotely like a crane, it was named after its discoverer Malcom Crane. Crane used to be a rather unremarkable student of mine who tended to overestimate his abilities and who flattered himself by giving this plant his name. Fittingly, the crane plant is a rather pompous plant.\nJungle bells are lovely, small plants that need much light and water. Still it is possible for a dedicated botanist to grow one or two of them if he really puts effort into it. Unfortunately, the jungle ants are as eager of this plant as the forementionend Malcom Crane was eager of some recognition.\nThe dawn singer is a plant that opens its blossom by the first sunbeam in the morning. Its blossom looks very close to an open mouth which probably led to its name. However, one might wonder if a less flattering name would have been more appropriate considering the awful odour that emanates from it in the morning hours.\nThe turtle sprouter can be cultivated quite easily since all it needs is much sun and warmth which can be easily provided in an environment like the jungle. It is somewhat more difficult to grow them in other regions although not impossible if mainly grown indoors. The name was derived from its sprouts that have the shape of small orbs.\nThe bees ballroom does not only attract bees but all kind of flying insects with its strange but not unpleasant odour. Usually you hear this plant before you actually see or smell it because there is a constant buzzing and humming of insects around it.\nThe jungle rose is a relative of our ordinary rose. Unlike the known roses, some plants of this species can reach impressive proportions while others do not exceed the size of an ordinary rose. It has not been discovered yet if this giant version is some subspecies or if its tremendous growth is influenced by other means.",

        "text": "Wondrous Plant Life - Jungle Edition Vol. 4\nThe titans orchid is rare and quite a sight. I have no idea how long it takes until a plant reaches its full size which even dwarfs some trees. I have not been able to grow one to its full size yet, and I begin to wonder how old those full grown plants we encountered might have been.\nThe purple cardinal is a plant that looks very different from any other plant. It grows to enormous proportions and it is the only plant that jungle ants avoid in their ravenous hunger. If we could figure out how the plant protects itself, we might be able to use that knowledge to cultivate the area.\nThe witches cauldron is quite an eye-catcher. It is extremely big and has its own beauty. The traveller should be warned that it is not advisable to drink the rainwater that gathers in the big blossom. The plant seems to poison the water in some way and severe stomach pains are the most harmless ailments that occur after drinking it. So the conclusion can be drawn that the whole plant is uneatable due to its poison.\nThe velvet petal is another giant plant of the jungle. Its smell is surprisingly unremarkable but the plant's colourful petals catch easily the attention of the wanderer. They are somewhat hairy and soft and indeed feel like velvet to the touch. The plant is very fragile though so caution is advised. How such a plant manages to survive in the harsh jungle remains a mystery.\nThe devils tongue flower is another remarkable species of Tiquanda. A man feels quite dwarfish next to this impressive flower. The fact that its leaves, after being dried and grinded, give a spicy substance has led to numerous attempts of Venoran traders to cultivate this plant. It must be feared that they start harvesting that plant in the jungle and destroy the complete species if their efforts in growing this plant stays unsuccessful.",

        "text": "Enemies of the True Faith\nFirst of all there are the heretics. Those are probably the most dangerous enemies because you hardly notice them. They undermine our society and the belief in the gods by their actions and their words. Some of them are crazy enough to think that they are true believers themselves. Their words erode the fundamentals of faith. They must be eliminated from our society. \nAs practitioners of dark and forbidden arts, witches are dangerous enemies as well. They must be avoided by all virtuous people that swore faithfulness to the gods. Witches are godless beings that even sacrifice evil creatures to get hold of their dark magic.\nThen there are the damned, the undead. There are two types of them - ghosts and the walking dead. Both are insults to the teachings of the gods, and both were denied eternal peace, surely for a good reason. They try to kill all living beings. They must be destroyed on sight.\nThe worst enemies are demons. They are malicious creatures of immense power that plot the downfall of mankind. With all our power and might we have to oppose these servants of the dark one.\nAll of these enemies pose a threat on their own. We have to be aware of all their evil intrigues to be able to protect our souls. Only a devout and brave heart can triumph over their dark temptations. Those who fail and stumble, even only once, are at risk to become heretics themselves. Therefore we must not only watch ourselves but also our brethren and sisters to see if they might have fallen and turned into enemies. \nThe best weapons to fight evil are bravery and faith. They are not only the best available arms but also the prerequisite to fight evil at all. Brave followers of the true faith might of course arm themselves with additional weapons. A vial of holy water often works wonders when it comes to clean desecrated places and to drive out unholy entities. Often, a believer needs nothing than a holy symbol combined with his unwavering faith to ward off some of the less powerful evil beings.\nThe holy ground of temples dedicated to the good gods is a safe haven for everyone as it cannot be entered by the servants of evil. Certain holy relics in the possession of these temples are able to harm or even to defeat the mightiest servants of darkness.\nWe are all sinners and we should neither be proud of our faith nor be smug about it as pride and vanity are the first steps to heresy. We should be aware of our failures and plead for forgiveness every day.",

I guess they don't like showers. Given their savageness and unpredictability it is not easy to come up with a counter strategy. It is obvious that the majority of the apes are trying to distract our guards while others sneak in and steal equipment of all sorts. Some of them are agile like ... well, like monkeys. Hard to catch - and they are sort of escape artists and might hide right under the ceiling. I even had one report of a citizen finding a monkey hiding in his depot box after a raid. Given the number of men at our disposal it is impossible to defend each and every side of the settlement. No sort of barricade would be of any help considering the nature of our attackers.\nThey get into and out of our fort just as it pleases them, and even the upper levels of the town that have proven to be safe against other beasts of the jungle are no hindrance to them. I see no real option to stop those attacks unless an army is sent here to find the apes' base of operation which seems to be somewhere in the north eastern jungle.",

The asuri are led by powerful princesses that are virtually invincible if confronted unprepared. However, even they have weaknesses. For example, the midnight asuri abhor heavy scents and the dawnfire asuri detest the sound of silver bells. In turn, the frost flower asuri can't stand anyone wearing red fabrics (not metal) near them. I have strong reason to believe that these weaknesses - as I call them - sufficiently weaken the otherwise powerful asura princesses, so they can be wounded.

        "text": "Explorer journal of Wilmot Dustheart, record 241 -\nIt's hard to believe but I actually discovered an iceberg at the shoreline north of Port Hope. First I was astonished: As this iceberg surely originates from Svargrond, so why wasn't it washed up north of Carlin or at least Thais? A study concerning the Tibian oceans' current conditions brought it to light: A strongly westward directed current of the Nordic Ocean prevents even a rather big ice bulk to be washed up north of Carlin. Instead it channels the iceberg through the passage between the islands Folda and Senja, past the Ghostlands west of Carlin. The current conditions of King's Gulf then direct the ice bulk through the strait between Fibula and Thais rather than channeling it into the bay. From there the drift would have directed the iceberg past Meriana as far as to the coast north of Darashia. But quite recently a heavy thunderstorm has torn it out of the current and washed the iceberg up here at the shoreline north of Port Hope. As it has already covered a long way, a part of the iceberg meanwhile surely has molten away. So the original size of this iceberg must have been vast. A chakoya clan inhabits the iceberg, but until now they are peaceful, yet curious. This is an extraordinary discovery! We already had knowledge about the Tibian oceans' current conditions, yet thus far it was unknown that bulks as big as this iceberg can travel so far by these currents. Thanks to this discovery I will be a renowned explorer soon! Yet, I'll have to stop my research for a short while and take a break in warmer surroundings, if I don't want to freeze completely ...",

The others get impatient like silly elves. Until now we have found only little gold but at least it proves that the gold is here and we will defend it fiercly against everyone that tries to steal it. We have already chased away those apes and lizards that used to prowl around here. Too bad there are no dworcs around whom me and the boys could teach about the sharpness of our axes. We have already killed some adventurers that came here. As if we did not knew that they are after our gold. I can see the greed in their eyes. They would kill for a nugget, so they get killed for a nugget.",

The problem with mad people is, they are simply misunderstood by everyone else. Of course he's completely sane. He showed me how to protect myself, how to use metal and magic to build a line of defense against everything and everyone from the outside world. He used servants made of iron, gold and even diamond - and I was allowed to \"refine\" them. But I'm afraid... it's not enough. I need...\n#443: I was lucky, very lucky. A dungeon... no, a fortress underground. I found a large - facility of some sort to give me shelter. Vast amounts of energy flow through its system of rooms and corridors. I need to find out how made this, how to... use this.\n#456: This whole construction was not used for a very long time. I found traces of its occupants but it's not clear whether they lived here or only used it for something, as I am about to do...\n#512: It's done! I found a way to harness the energy of this place. It works like a focus, binding extreme amounts of energy for a purpose which is still beyond me - but it matters not. As my brother did in Edron, I will now declare this my base of operation. My lair. My source of power AND protection. Protection is the most important thing. I will not make any mistakes - this will be my bastion against EVERYTHING.\n#612: Didn't get outside very much. Not at all. Didn't hear much about Boyd. The \"mad mage\" had an experiment gone wrong it seems. He's nowhere to be seen anymore. Not even in his fortress. I will follow in his footsteps. They just don't understand.\n#632: I am holed up in my fortress. I harness its energy. Cosmic energy way beyond anything I have ever seen. I use the lower chamber to build an indestructible armour of power around me. Nothing can touch me. I don't need food, I don't need sleep. Now I can think. I can reflect on the world without it being any nuisance anymore. I don't care who built all this or what its purpose was.\n#667: It was built... for me.",

Even more how their arrangement amplifies the energy even further. From all what I learned from my old master, this should be impossible. But somehow parts of the plant seem to bend what is impossible and what not. Yet it is obvious that the machinery is put into severe stress by all that power and the whole material is not capable of enduring that king of strain for a prolonged time.

        "text": "As far as I was able to study the plans for the plant and watch things in work, I have to admit that its function is beyond my comprehension. Larger parts of the glooth application are done in formerly unseen ways. Most designs are so far apart from classic design that I wonder who in the world would come up with such concepts. I consider myself an expert in glooth machinery and yet I can't figure out how any team in Rathleton could create the designs which where used. Much of the work is attributed to the late professor Larington's team but I knew Larington, and though he was prominent with the city administration he was too much of a traditionalist to harbour such revolutionary ideas. Even more strange is the silence that is met with when you ask former team members about their work with Larington. At best you get some secrecy phrases but it's quite obvious how nervous most of them become when further pressed. Most of them are not as experienced and brilliant as I am anyway. So how could this old geezer and a bunch of dilettantes could create some plant that even I don't remotely understand? And what are they hiding at all? Some officials 'informed' me I should stick to my own business and my tasks at hand. It was suggested that further investigation would do no good to my scientific careerer. This makes me wonder even more, although I will keep my investigations less obvious from now on. One of the new workers is eyeing me suspiciously. I might become paranoid, but better safe than sorry - I will try to evade him in the future, and better hide these notes somewhere.",

While the plant was in construction they were only a nuisance but now that it is up and running all kind of wierd creatures seem to be drawn to it for what reason ever. In the case of the minotaurs it is easy to see what they are up to. They want to hurt the city badly and perhaps even overtake the plant and use it for their own. But they seem to be mostly motivated to deny the plant to Ratleton at all cost even if it means that they sacrifice their invading force to blew it up. The other creatures though - we have no idea what drives them into such a frenzy to attack the plant. Probably some of the machines it making a noise or vibration or whatever that drives them mad. Even more unsettling is the organized way of the attacks. As if even there is some driving force behind it. That might even be seen as possible for the automatons. Indeed someone could be creating and leading them from a distance, but why and how eludes us. But what of the beasts? What drives them to their ferocious attacks? Another question is how long we can stand those constant attacks and what might happen if we ultimately fail to repel them some day?",

        "text": "Scientific Research Report by Georgia Rainbird:\n\nThree months ago I discovered it for the first time: A strange kind of glooth, deep purple in colour and of a slightly different consistency than the glooth variant we knew until now. There are some pools or ponds of this glooth in the upper mushroom caves in the east of the tunnels. At the time of my researches these were the only ones, but I fear they are spreading. I assume, it is a kind of mutation that caused the glooth to change this way. I was very careful about my researches as I don't yet know all possible side effects of this mutated glooth variant. What I was able to determine is the following: The mutated glooth is a dangerous thing. It affects its environment in a clearly negative fashion. Some plants wither and rot under its influence, others mutate into toxic, sometimes even animated variants. Smaller cave dwellers as rats, toads and bugs are likewise affected by the side effects of the mutated glooth. They also evolve into poisonous, bigger and stronger variants of themselves. They show an increased aggressiveness and seem to infect other animals with their bite. These first observations lead me to believe that the glooth mutation down here has to be stopped. If it spreads out the danger for Rathleton or even Oramond could be immense.",

Usually, only the eldest heir, his spouse and their firstborn heir are counted to this class. They own the factories or will own them one day, and the whole family fortune is at their disposal. They undergo a rigid training for their destiny and are schooled in reading, writing, magic and other important matters, depending on the tastes of the heads of the family.They are rarely seen in their factories and don't mingle with less than the upper class; and even this might be rare in some cases.

They are subject to only a few rules and laws of the city, and are the only ones 'important' enough to vote on them.\nWhile in theory it is possible that one of the poor does so much for the city that, through his earned votes, he might become important enough to vote on rules that affect even the high class, this is practically impossible. Everything a poor person can do will grant him only a handful of votes at best, whereas simply owning a factory for a few months will generate enough votes to elevate someone to a status of importance. \nThe high class is quite eager to use their votes in a most efficient way, so they rarely vote on things that won't affect them at all. This gives the lower classes some autonomy in issues that affect only them. Since changing labour conditions and the like is considered a more important decision, only a few of the lower classes are allowed to vote on them at all and are easily overruled by the sheer number of votes a single factory owner owns. Therefore, they rarely waste their votes on such issues at all and leave it to the higher classes.\nThe upper class has the least votes in comparison, but the most privileges. Since the secondary heirs rarely rise to enough importance to vote about their own class, they sometimes sell their votes to interested higher class members who want to influence lower class decisions without wasting their own more valuable votes. Others generate some considerable amount of votes by working as city officials. Their importance allows them to influence matters that affect the city as a whole, and they are often flattered and ultimately bought by the higher class, mostly of their own family, to vote in their interest. Those officials lead a relatively comfortable life, and some may gather enough wealth to invest in a factory, or to support an artist or inventor. Sometimes this investment pays off, and sometimes this is how the second branch of the family surpasses the first.",

        "text": "The Big Book of Glooth Pt.1\nIt's hard to imagine how life was before the breakthrough discovery of the glooth. Some hundred years ago, the first timid attempts were made to harvest and use the slime of the gloothworms. It was known it could be used to distil a strong glooth wine and in dire times, the substance was thickened and used as food by the poor. But only when inventor Baribar Glooth began his experiments and met with success, the usefulness of the worms and their product became apparent. The unassuming worms and their slime were named after that great man and soon others followed and discovered even more ways to manipulate, change and use glooth to the prosperity of all.\nBaribar had studied glooth for years and tried to manipulate it by heat, magic and the like with moderate success. Following a hunch, he used lightning magic on the slime and therefore changed the fate of Rathleton. The first experiments yielded only a solid but brittle substance. By changing the duration and intensity of exposition to energy, he managed to give the substance he created entirely different attributes. First and foremost his efforts concentrated on creating a substitute for metal. On his way to create what later would be known as gloothal, he discovered the elastic gloothy that today is produced in several standard elasticities that found a wide range of usage in the crafts and in daily life.\nHis assistant Dagomir pushed the research into discovering the properties of more liquid forms of glooth. By mixing the application of heat and lightning, he produced several by-products that were at first discarded, but used by later generations of inventors to expand into new areas of glooth usage. His final discovery, many years after the death of his former master and mentor Glooth, was the gloothomir, a substance that burned with a strange greenish flame that produces almost no heat compared to normal fire but burns for an extremely long time. Later generations refined the gloothomir to the gloothine that has similar properties but produced a lot of invisible smoke, while using itself up quicker than the gloothomir.",

        "text": "The Big Book of Glooth Pt.2\nFirst dismissed as useless, Hergis Brunt, inventor and visionary in the field of mechanics, used the properties of gloothine in the creation of his first brunt-machines. With the spread of glooth usage the demand for the slime grew to an extent where the worm farms could not keep up. Progress was stunted for several decades before a group of scientists made a breakthrough in breaking down garbage of glooth products into the basic slime they were originally made of. Others dedicated their research to finding some use for the by-products of glooth creation. Glooth spice and glooth pudding found their way into the homes of even the poorest to supply them with new glooth-born strength.\nWith increased reusability and more efficient worm farms and better worm breeding, the supply of glooth was once again secured, but it showed that overdependence was a danger. Efforts to gain other resources were renewed and increased. Still, the glooth inventions flourished even when experiments with other catalysts than energy and to some degree heat, met with little substantial results and ended up as an often mocked side note of science.\nIn our days it is hard to imagine what a world without glooth would look like. Our day begins when we clean our teeth with a gloothbrush and ends when we lay down in our beds with a glooth casting. This is something the glooth critics readily ignore in their unfounded rants against glooth, whenever they come up with their horror scenarios in which the glooth suddenly reverts back to its slime state, drowning each and everyone in Rathleton in a wave of slime. Those ungrateful enemies of progress just argue for argument's sake and shouldn't be given the attention they are desperately looking for. The glooth has led us to an age of prosperity and progress, and there is no way for a sane person to go back into the dark ages before the glooth.",

        "text": "When we arrived here by means I'm not allowed to mention, we found not an abandoned isle and save haven to build a secret base, but a populated and civilised kingdom. Unsure it we were to continue with our initial plan nonetheless I sent word to the other dreammasters for a decision. Meanwhile I sent scouts to watch the strange inhabitants of this new land and get as much information about them as possible. After verifying that they were at least not openly in league with demons or the brotherhood, I decided to make contact. The people we met were seemingly completely human, albeit somewhat pale and of an tired and disinterested attitude. Although they obviously had never encountered a dwarf, they paid my right hand man only little more attention then anyone else. And that was little enough. This already made me suspicious and as we were invited by their leader to dine with him as honoured guests I told my men to be on guard. I postponed the invitation under the ruse of affairs I had to attend before, so I could use the time to see if my dream would grant me some insight and wisdom. As it is known those dreams are never direct, neither prophetic but with all this screams, carnage and bloodshed in my dreams there was little to be mistaken. Yet I refrained, as dreams are treacherous if threatened with ignorance. How easy it is to cause all that you dreamed about by your own actions because of your dreams. So we prepared potent antidotes and runes to deflect any attacks or traps that might await us. King Julas as he was called was a gentle enough host and the feast if not splendid was appropriate. Yet at the serving of the wine the magic amulet I had donned warned me about poison. I silently informed my men as I had told them in advance. Each of us secretly used an antidote rune on himself while others of us distracted our host and his retinue. As the evening turned to night our host was becoming more and more nervous, obviously waiting for his poison to take effect. Smiling inwardly I turned the polite discussion to the ways of our order, casually mentioned that we were known to reward our friends well and deal with traitors and their ilk swiftly and without mercy. More and more that Julas became nervous and more and more my talk became more stern and threatening. Only thinly veiled I finally had told him that I was aware about his treachery and were prepared to retaliate. Finally he broke in and with a shrieking voice he ordered his guards to attack. I and my men were accustomed to fight enemies more fierce then those men who where numerous but trained as militia or city-guardsman at best. We made sort work and soon most of them surrendered. King Julas though had retreated already. I interrogated the men at arms and learned that Julas as his father before him ruled the island with an iron and oppressive fist after years of freedom and prosperity. We searched the castle for Julas, fighting through some of his remaining men who offered only half-hearted resistance before giving up.",

        "text": "As I mentioned we were no strangers to battle and the gruesome sights of war but none of us was prepared for when we found Julas, after hacking through the doors that guarded his personal quarters. Let us just say he had done 'things' to his servants and his own body. The walls were smeared with blood in patterns that reminded me on magic symbols. He was barely alive, more then could be said about his poor servants, a dozens or so. And there was madness in his eyes. A madness that was so deep and intense that you could not stand the look of his eyes for long. He was babbling incoherent sentences and giggling and laughing all the while spittle dropped uncontrollable from his mouth. With his mutilations he might not have survived the night anyway but I was taking no chances. I had a pyre constructed and got rid of him before the turn of midnight. None of his subjects objected. That alone was proof I was right to do that.\nI assumed now things would take a turn for the better now. I assumed reign over the city awaiting the people to show some rightful successor I could accept and planed to go on with the construction of a base for our order. But perhaps I should have read my dreams better then that.\nAt first it became obvious that each and every night I tried to enter the dream realm I became trapped in nightmares of blood and soon sensed a presence of something malignant, evil but completely elusive that was stalking me. And more! There was something, not yet a voice though, that seemed to urge me to do even more vile and abominable thing as Julas had done.\nTo make matters worse each and every pretender for the throne the citizens half-heartedly presented seemed to be the descendant of the same degenerate branch of a family that hat two generations ago slaughtered any other of the royal lines to the last man. I sensed that non of them was to be trusted, each of one more depraved  then the other.\nSo I was in a dilemma. Through the malignant presence the isle was unsuitable for us as a base. No chance to create a dreampath here or to have dreams not tainted by whatever lurked here. On the other hand those people were in desperate need of leadership and something had to be done about whatever haunted this isle.\nSo with no resistance from the citizens who seemed rather glad that not another ruler of that degenerate line would be instituted I assumed the title of lord protector of the realm. Though I had to sent most of my men away to fight in other battles and the other dreammasters showed concern about my decision I think it was the right thing to do. I will lead this people to new prosperity and will see that the evil of the isle is contained while I work to find a way to destroy it once and for all.",

        "text": "Since my arrival on the isle I have learned a lot of interesting things. Most of it is folklore of course, as the people sadly had little use for record as it seemed. What I found out, from ancient tales and crumbling tomes as well as from my explorations of the isle, granted me some insights. First of all, before men settled here some ancient race left its mark on the isle. From what I have seen, the remaining ruins indicate some advanced civilisation that pre-dated men. They commanded some technological knowledge beyond what I've seen anywhere. Perhaps those ancient ruins are all what's left from the mythical civilisation of Yalahar. Perhaps while strolling through Rathleton I've walked through what the ravages of time left over from the famous city itself? However, when the first humans arrived, the city had been abandoned and lain in ruins since long ago. The humans, wherever they might have come from, settled for a simple life in the ruins, in ignorance of the marvels ans wonders around them. Curiosity led them to some minor rediscoveries of ancient knowledge, but it seems they made little out of it. Some forages were made into the area of forging and the use of steam, whereas architecture was oddly neglected and people rather sook shelter in caves.\nIt is uncertain what exactly happened, but I assume at some point their digging and exploring awakened some ancient evil, something so powerful that they stood no chance of resistance. They were overwhelmed and enslaved by an entity that was drawn to sacrifices, and especially blood. But if any of the ancient fairy tales are worth something, it was not some vampire, perhaps not even a physical being. Nonetheless, dark times of servitude began for the people of the isle. Slavery and taxes in blood was their lot for many generations.\nThis did only change with the arrival of 'princess' Ramora. Now this person is shrouded in mystery, too. Though each story claims highest nobility for her, there is no record at all about such a princess in any archive that I had access to. This might mean nothing though, as it is entirely possible that this princess and her conquest date back to the last days of the mythical Corpse Wars. Though native lore and that of the invaders mingle here, it is often mentioned that things took place in the time when 'dead men walked'. Given the constant threat of the Corpse Wars, it seems likely that those incidents triggered the exodus of said princess and her people. Still, the nobility of this princess is disputable. Granted, there is next to no record that survived from those times. It is entirely possible that the princess was some tribe's ruler or something like that. The key here is that no heritage or title but that of 'princess' in her name connect to her in any existing lore. Knowing to what an end the nobility goes to preserve their family names, at least ist must strike one as odd that no traceable surname survived in all those tales. The next thing are clashing reports about how the exodus took place.",

        "text": "While some stories claim that the princess ruled over a realm besieged by an endless stream of enemies (the undead perhaps), and that she ordered her remaining people to board their ships and set sail, others tell of a long journey through besieged lands, of endless battles that took their toll on her people until they reached the coast where they 'boarded the ships' and set sail. Now, the latter version suggests a perhaps darker version of the story, since the boarding of foreign ships would not have taken place without some force and warfare on its own. Yet in even other stories it is said that the 'goodly seapeople' took pity of the plight of the princess, and that their ships came from the mists to carry her people away. Interestingly, the 'seapeople' are a consistent element in various tales about the exodus. In one version, closest to the basic one, the king of the seapeople became smitten with the brave and strong princess and agreed to save her people if she bore him a child. Upon arrival at their destination, the pregnant princess denied the sea king his child and he therefore cursed her people to never be able to traverse the seas again. In several other stories, the seapeople at least encountered the princess and for some reason or other agreed to guide her through the sea that was in turmoil due to violent storms and savage sea creatures. Most descriptions of the seapeople picture them to be tall, slender, with pointy ears and bluish skin. I believe here the natives mixed up the seapeople with the elves from the stories of the newly arrived settlers.\nBe that as it may, the princess and her men finally ended up on an unknown coastline. Stories tell of an attempted ambush on her and her forces. It's entirely possible though that they already arrived as would-be conquerors. Regardless of this, it seemed certain that the populace of the isle was oppressed by some creature so that the princes did not have to fight the human population in any significant way. Instead, they fought the 'other minions' of the blood lord, often described as beasts entirely made up of blood and gore. It is likely that having fought in the Corpse Wars and having survived them, Ramora and her followers had weapons, tactics ans magic available to fight even such abomination, without running away screaming at the first confrontation. Finally they cornered and slew the beast that oppressed the isle. Probably in a gesture of unification she married (? the stories here a irritatingly vague) a local man that was declared to be some hero in the whole affair. Bringing with them more determination than the natives had and possessing some knowledge that was alien to them, the new arrivals changed the isle's civilisation significantly. Houses were built, the crude machines where put to a more efficient use, and more effort was put into understanding the relics of the past.",

        "text": "This led to a rise of steam technology which to the simple-minded must have seemed like magic. Though far removed form the accomplishments of the fabled Yalahari, their progress in those years must have been remarkable whereas in the present it has come to a crawl. Perhaps there are only so many secrets to be unlocked in the mundane world, but only the secrets of magic are endless. But I'm getting carried away.\nIt seems that even with the destruction of the blood lord, some of his rituals prevailed. Perhaps there has always been a circle of trusted collaborators, who knows. When my order arrived here, that cult prospered again and had intoxicated the royal line. So when our detachment arrived here, the isle was again in the grip of a ruthless dictatorship and alliance with some gruesome blood cult.\nThe destruction of the cult led to a power vacuum that had to be filled. Two generations of lord protectors have until now overseen the well-being of the native people, and although it is increasingly hard to keep contact with the mainland, our protectorate flourishes. I consider myself fortunate that my superiors in the order allowed me to do my research here. I will prove to them that even without the abilities of dreamwalking I'm a useful member of the order. I've already planned several expeditions with the help of the natives, using old folklore as guidance. With the gracious help of the current Lord Protector, everything seems possible. Who knows what secrets I might discover. Perhaps I can prove that here is indeed what is left of the once proud city of Yalahar.",

        "text": "The perilous adventures of captain caveworm Pt. I\nThe saga of captain caveworm begun with a daring couple of cave explorers. After their wedding the two scientists decided to go on a rather unusual honeymoon trip and to explore some recently discovered caves together. Venturing into the unknown depths beneath Rathleton they became cut off from their return route by a cave in. Using their unique knowledge of the subterranean flora and fauna they managed to survive and build a shelter to await some sort of rescue. Because they were assumed dead this rescue never arrived though. As time passed they became aware that they would have to work on their rescue all alone. This became more complicated by the pregnancy of the wife. They decided to focus on survival first and to find a way to escape later on. The husband begun the capture and training of caveworms, a more social and less dangerous cousin of the rotworm. They were used as means of digging, hunting for food and providing some protection against the more aggressive rotworm colonies nearby. For a while some sort of stability was achieved and the woman gave birth to a boy. Due to unforeseen complications in birth the wife never fully recovered from pregnancy. So it was up to the husband and his caveworms to provide them nourishment and shelter. The attacks of the rotworms continued and became even more fierce. The couple did it's best to raise their child and give it the best education they could provide under this circumstances. At some point the wife's strength finally failed her and she died in her sleep. The grief stricken husband was ridden with guilt and his spirit broken. So one day he let his guard down and their shelter was overrun by rampaging rotworms. He sacrificed his life to allow his son to escape, accompanied by their most trusted caveworms. That much could be deduced by later excavations and reading some remaining notes of the couple and also due to remarks of captain caveworm to some of the people he met and befriended. What then had happened to the boy is a wild mix of myth, speculation and deduction.\nIt seems the caveworms kind of raised him as one of their own and he learned to live in the caveworm way. It is said that the caveworms discovered a small colony of worms that were closely related to the goothworm and yet astonishing different on several regards. The kid used them as one of his food sources what begun to change him even more than the environment and his foster parents already did. He developed uncanny senses and his teeth and fingernails became incredibly hard and sharp. He also acquired a high grade of agility and a flexibility of his body to wind his way even through the narrowest and winding tunnels.\nFor some years he lived the adventurous life of a caveworm until one day the rotworms found his new home. This time though the youth would not flee but use his new found powers to fight back. He managed to slay the murderous worms but his new shelter was destroyed and his foster parents were killed.",

        "text": "The perilous adventures of captain caveworm Pt. II\nHe lonely roamed the caves for a while but eventually the youth begun to long for human companionship and used his skills to search for the people of his parents. It seemed the first people he encountered were some simple glooth farmers in some remote caves. They befriended the shy kid and took him in. He once more showed his ability to adapt and soon grasped the concepts of human society. But not all he learned though appealed to the youth who had grown up with the lectures of his scientific parents and the simple but just way of the caveworms. The kid got himself into some fights against what he saw as unjust and oppressive and he had to flee once again. This time he returned under the cover of a made up identity and kept a low profile. Since his sense of justice had not been diminished he created yet another identity, that of a masked freedom fighter whose uniform bore the likeness and symbolism of the caveworms. For a while 'the worm' appeared out of nowhere, where the weak were severely mistreated, to bring them freedom and punishment to their oppressors.\nThis culminated into a battle against a powerful factory owner who not only abused his workers but also secretly planned to take over the city. After years of battles in the shadows this lead to a desperate attempt of the factory owner to hastily use his private army to overthrow the government before his schemes were revealed to the public. He might have succeeded if not for the masked figure who managed to lead a huge army of caveworms and other subterranean beasts against him.\nThe factory owner was defeated and his mysterious opponent disappeared into the darkness of the caves once again. In the gloothpapers he first had many new names like 'the worm general' but soon the public begun to call him captain caveworm instead.\nIn the days to come the mysterious man would switch more and more to fighting powerful criminals who he saw as a more immediate threat for the people. And indeed there seemed to be no shortage of freaks, mad scientists and criminal masterminds to keep him occupied. Some of the most notorious arch enemies that Captain Caveworm acquired over the years were the nefarious Dr. Dentist, the seductive Minowoman, the sinister Mean Green, the lethal Glooth Fairy and the powerful Pulverizer.\nThe captain never made a public appearance and his existence is shrouded with myth and rumours.",

It is covered with giant scrawls that are often blotched and nearly unreadable, as if written by hands unused to holding a pen)\nDay 4 - I have contacted the Stantons through my loyal messenger Maro. Maybe a spell, a rune, a potion can heal me? I hope Emily is fine and does not worry too much, I have been gone for several days now... Perhaps I should write to her? But what do I tell her? That this... hide is covering my skin as to make me unable to touch her? Oh no no, I cannot do this. I cannot let her see me, imagine me like this! Better to leave her in doubt than this horrible knowledge. Alaistar has promised to look after her. That must be enough for now. Oh, how I long to shed these vile scales that cover my skin!\n...\nDay 35 - The Stantons know of no potion or spell that can cure me. I am doomed to stay here until I find an antidote. Luckily, I have, at least for now, all I need to conduct the necessary experiments; it was a lucky hunch that led me to build the particle accelerator here instead of in the factory! Who knows, maybe this transformation put me on the lead to a new invention? But if yes, which one, to what end? I cannot think why anyone should wish to look and feel as grossly confined in this massive, ogrish body as I do. Oh, to be human again!\n...\nDay 46 - At least I do not need sleep in this brutish form, but how I wish there was some human company! And what about Emily? ... I must not dwell on these thoughts. I must find a cure. I must!\n...\nDay 61 -  The salve only thickened this horrible hide that covers and deforms my body. But I cannot give up. I must think of Emily. I have written some letters to make sure our family fortune will not be withheld from her, but will my family, will Carefew have accepted those letters as my own? I must ask my messenger about the news from above.\n...\nDay 65 - This is disastrous! Maro says that my letters were not accepted, that Carefew said they were frauds! FRAUDS! How dare he! He cannot deny it is my sigil, but he says my writing has been forged. FORGED! By the gods above and below! Has he lost all decency, to leave Emily bereft of what is rightly hers? Oh, the infamy! But I see how it is. Carefew has never been a friend of mine, and seeks revenge through vile attacks on my dearest. If only I could ascertain that my writing IS still unchanged! Oh, if only someone had old writings from me that I could study! But with these enormous hands, what is there to be done? Would devising a writing golem help? But oh no no, the golem could still not copy my style. This is wretched, wretched indeed!\n...\nDay 243 - I am near desperation. Maro has informed me he can no longer be my messenger to the world above. Will this torment never end?\n...\nDay 352 - Another failure. I can't get the recipe to work. Oh my dearest Emily, will I ever see you again?\n...\nDay 456 - I am on the lead of something. I think it may be the mixture of gases that caused the chain reaction in the factory. Maybe if I can reverse the effect?\n...\nDay 581 - After weeks of endless tests, I must conclude that gases were a dead end. Nothing worked. Maybe not a potion, but a slowly dissolving pill or lozenge? If the ingredients were to release their effects step by step, internally, would they reduce this thick, hideous hide? Must research.\n...\nDay 876 - Maybe tonight I will finally have the breakthrough, I feel it is within my grasp! The latest experiments have been very promising. Oh Emily... wait for me, my darling.\n...\nDay 1001 - I must not, I cannot give up! There must be a way to undo this! Maybe I have been wrong to indulge in this diary. I shall leave the days uncounted from now on, and only think of my goal. All I need now is a messenger. Time will show me a way, I am certain of it. Oh Emily, my love. My thoughts are with you, always.",

        "text": "A Venture through the Oramond Fields, by Doctor Alaistar Stanton.\nThe Oramond Fields that surround the city of Rathleton hold many a marvel to behold. The grasslands are home to many small and larger animals, peaceful like the gloothworms and aggressive like the devourers. Indeed, glooth is what has given the fauna and flora of the isle its particular shape.\nStudying old carcasses in the deeper earth layers have led me to believe the creatures may have looked differently in earlier centuries. Glooth residue varies in the bones, indicating the creatures absorbed it somehow and were changed by it - the bones are similar, but not quite alike those of today's animal inhabitants.\nThe flora of Oramond is less developed than the fauna. Again, I believe the glooth to be the reason. Though in earlier days, maybe the climate was milder too before the mists closed in. The few trees that grow in the shelter of the city centre are the last remnants of forests that must have once covered the southern grasslands. But when the weather grew colder and darker through the mist clouding the skies and keeping off the warm winds, they must have retreated. The gloothworms, revelling in damp and cold earth, spread, and I believe their soaking the earth with glooth residue must have prevented the tree seeds from growing again. The grazing animals consequently chose to eat more of the glooth-imbibed grasses, and adapted to the changed environment, while the carnivores, feeding on them in turn, absorbed the glooth through their prey.\nThough much of this is still theory, I am confident that through ongoing research I will one day have a reliable amount of data on the natural history of Oramond to prove my assumptions right.",

I don't know what ancient culture could have built this nor whether it was a sanctuary, palace or something completely different. The main part of these ruins is a small place, accurately built of black and white tiles. In the centre is a big black stone figure, surrounded by four different statues. Each of them has an inscription, which gives a hint on what the statue wishes. I assume if one can fulfil all four wishes, something will happen, yet I don't know what this 'something' could be. I also noticed that the inscription on one of the statues became unreadable over time. Based on an old legend I assume, the last request could be: 'Adorn me.'",

To be honest, at first we were more than suspicious as we learned that you are hiring a gang of criminals and have them do the more inconvenient tasks for you. But seemingly you are able to keep away from them the important information about your actual goals and intentions. Furthermore your succes in establishing a makeshift laboratory in the tunnels under Rathleton and even acquiring some novel glooth based weaponry speaks for itself. The mutated glooth you mentioned in your last letter is an interesting matter. Perhaps it is useable in an arcane way to enhance spells or improve potions. Even the creation of yet unknown artefacts could be possible. We think your endeavours are taking a good path.\nWith best regards\nUquora the High-Handed of the Circle of the Black Sphinx",

Our valued assistant Tassondis, whom I always held in the highest regard, had a remarkable idea - replicas! We established Site XVII and rebuilt the two exhibits the other researchers found - near perfect copies - so both our teams could study them separately! Of course we had the advantage of being able to work in a practically ideal environment as well as in secret. We used this to our advantage and, due to the help of Tassondis, managed to decipher the second relic in no time! The results have been added both to the current research documents, as well as our own records (note: Compendium Site XIV and XVII, edited) and will be removed from this document for obvious reasons.\n<the next pages of this document have been removed, the last page has some notes scribbled on the back>\nGetting to the bottom of walls VB and VC was pretty obvious, Tassondis wasn't even the first one to understand them. Both engraved walls are part of the larger Ab'Dendriel exhibit, very similar to the smaller one, which is located on the surface. The other two sides on the back of the exhibit, VA and VD, are not even part of the solution. And when I told him that both walls are probably interconnected with a single unique meaning, he reacted quite surprised and immediately got to work. He made quick progress and suddenly HE was the one who saved the day. He didn't even mention me! And I doubt he would have even perceived the engravings on the stones at all! He called all exhibits they found \"magic stones\"! Magic stones? What is this! He clearly has no idea what he is talking about, nor how significant our work here actually is. Careful observation of the Ab'Dendriel exhibits would have shown him that there is more to the surface of these strange menhirs than meets the eye. Who could have known that a considered researcher like him would literally only get a hint if it jumped right at him?\nIf you ever take the time to read this, Cannos, don't just let Tassondis get away with this. This discovery was a team effort, you of all people should know this.\nKhuun",

Yet I fear I have sacrificed too much of my humanity to truly connect to its call and read its meaning. But that is only a temporary hindrance. In the end, it will be my power that controls the grail and bends it to my will! I wonder if I should put more effort into reviving that blood lord. I still think it's possible, but given what little information we have we can't be sure what it truly is, and if we can bind it to our cause. Then again, a puppet blood lord might be just what I need to find the grail. It certainly shares strong connections with this artefact. Yet I wonder who was the master, and who the tool. The others seem to think I'm only on a mission to recruit another legionnaire, and are oblivious to the existence of the grail - for now. As soon as the word spreads, they will come for its power. I cannot allow any of them to best me in this bid for power. The grail might increase my status in the legion tenfold. I might be called to serve under the master himself. Yet, what if the power of the grail is great enough to rival that of the master? Will he allow me to keep it? Hardly. Thinking of it, he might even bestow it on one of his champions. That I cannot allow to happen. I must acquire the grail, bend its power under my will and confront my peers and superiors from a position of power! The grail has ever been a source of corruption. And all that while remaining hidden and unused. What power will it have if used directly? Kingdoms may crumble under my will. I can subvert them from within. And the power over blood - I'm sure the grail was used by the blood lord to create his minions. If I had such a tool I reckon it could elevate me over some of the most powerful monster makers of the legion.But I have to be careful. The legion is not to be underestimated. They are not such fools as the Brotherhood of Bones was. To think I once associated with them is deeply embarrassing in hindsight. It is a good thing I cut off all connections before their demise. However, the legion is a completely different beast; and the master, well, as shrouded in mystery as he is, to hold such a diverse group of powerful individuals together and bind them to a cause shows how much power he commands. Though perhaps it might be possible to challenge him with the power of the grail - but on the other hand, it may be wise to take the grail into hiding and study it thoroughly before making my move. I'd better make my decision once I have the grail in my hands and can assess its power somehow. For now, I have to focus on my current task and play along with the legion.",

        "text": "The Fauna and Flora of the Isle of Oramond, by Doctor Alaistar Stanton.\nChapter I: Ruling Species of the Fauna.\nThe flora and fauna of Oramond are, maybe, very ingrown in comparison to unknown lands where our own ancestors may have come from in the days before the mist. However, they form a beautiful and complex whole. The isle of Oramond shows signs of long-dead creatures that have arrived at different times here and, sometimes, strove for supremacy, leaving only inexplicable ruins, as well as signs of younger creatures that arrived maybe only some generations ago. However, the different species do not mingle and are often very reluctant to make peaceful contact.\nI.i. Of Minotaurs and Men\nAmidst the newer species, one must count the minotaurs and the humans. While the minotaurs are the newer arrivals, both have been settled here long enough to vie for supremacy of the island, trying to eradicate the other. Yet while our own origins are still shrouded in mist, there are ancient ruins on this isle that seem man-made. The minotaurs seem to have evolved on another island or continent though. They are not natives to this isle who left and returned when the mist lifted, but are new arrivals on this isle, which they immediately claimed as their own. Closer examination of their camps and habits led me to the hypothesis that they may have followed a call of some bold chieftain or supreme ruler of theirs, searching for a holy, paradisical land, which led them to the isle and which they must defend from the grip of barbarians, the humans.",

It is located north of Oramond, bordered by high mountains to the south, a wild sea to the east, huge cacti forests to the west and rocky hills to the north. At the rugged shores of Krailos one may find many shipwrecks, as the area is surrounded by treacherous underwater shelves.\nKrailos itself is mainly covered in sandy plains and has a rather hot climate, which has led to a sparsely spread population. This means most of the ogres live in small tent villages. There is just one bigger settlement, which is home to the Bloody Skulls tribe. Also, some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. The country's landscape is harsh: rocky beaches, dried-up salt lakes, rugged rock formations and dry, barren fields number among the reasons why the area is avoided by foreigners. Another reason of course are the ogres themselves.",

The ogres'  hunting skills and physical strength are among their current greatest benefits; and the mountains of Krailos hold some rare minerals. On the other hand, Krailos lacks a lot in infrastructure and clean water.\nKrailos is a tribal nation, divided into several different clans. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre (although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title). The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Within a tribe, there may be a couple of opposing individuals against the current chieftain, but overt struggles for leadership are rather uncommon. Each tribe is independent of the others, and conflicts between two tribes occur frequently. However, the greatest threat to the ogres actually is the desiccation of the lakes and rivers. But the current chieftains are too preoccupied with their tribal conflicts to seek solutions for this issue.\nThe ogres are simple, warlike people, more interested in a fight and good food than in politics. Elimination of competitors is an accepted way of moving up in the ogre ranks. Ogres like conflict. They are impulsive, quick to anger and do not hold back their opinions regardless of who might take offense. Ogres prefer to solve conflicts through combat rather than words. Yet, an honorable death is not the highest purpose in an ogre's life, but rather a fulfilled life, which primarily means enough food and a comfortable hut. Ogres are distrustful towards strangers and tend to welcome them with avoidance in the best case. Lately yet, a tribe called the Bloody Skulls has shown a sort of interest in trade with other peoples.\nA kind of spiritual shamanic animism holds a certain importance in the ogres' lives and each tribe's shamans are always renowned members of the society. The common ogres are moderately spiritual and have rites of passage and annual rites concerning the seasons and certain weather phenomena. Ogres worhip The Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (food but also living creatures) to feed this entity. Otherwise, ogres care only for the here-and-now.\nContrary to common prejudices, ogres are at least a little more than mindless brutes. They possess a talent for animism and have certain artisanal skills. For example they have developed passable methods of curing and tanning hides, so their leatherwork is quite convenient. Despite their great passion for eating the ogres don't have a reputation as outstanding cooks as their meals seldom match other peoples' taste. Ogres eat especially meat - of hunted animals but also the meat of humanoids, mainly humans and elves. This is the reason they also are referred to as \"maneaters\". It is important to mention that they never give in to cannibalism. Besides meat they also love sweet tasting things, such as honey combs or cakes, although they don't get the latter too often.",

After several hours of fighting against the elemental forces, the gods decided to bring us here, wherever that may be. We are glad to have solid ground under our feet even though it only seems to be sea ice. Everyone is exhausted so we will start to explore that area not before tomorrow.\nDay 5:\nWhat a mess! Every morning, since the day we stranded on this cursed piece of frozen water, one of my crew members disappears or lies dead in his berth terribly battered. Something evil is going on here and I swear to find out what that is... if I stay alive long enough.\nDay 7:\nLast night, we have been ambushed. About two dozens of small, furry creatures launched a well organised attack against us. The rest of my crew was without the slightest chance. I managed to hide myself here in my cabin without being recognised. I am such a coward, it would have been better if I had died with my crew.\nDay 10:\nIn the last three days, I continued to explore the area around here and made an exciting discovery. To the south, there is a small ice cavern in which one of those beasts is hiding. It behaves quite differently than its fellows. As far as I can judge, this one is not hostile. Maybe it is possible to get in contact with it and gather some information about its species.\nDay 13:\nI found out that they call themselves \"chakoya\" and the only thing they really like is fish. Nothing but fish. However, the one in the cave is very picky and doesn't like the 'usual' type of fish. The creature seems to be hunted by its species but I don't know why. I have to be careful. After I left the cave, I saw a few of its fellows which were patrolling the area. I hope they didn't see me.",

If she have been sent to a good magical college, she might have become a magician of some renown. On the other hand, she is much more interested in worldly affairs and less in research. However, her influence on her people is growing and the spells I taught her earned her great respect. Only the old fashioned clique of druids still oppose her, despite of her obvious power and the knowledge she had gained from me. Some things are seemingly always the same, everywhere in the world.\nThe Carlin miners are a thick-headed and stubborn bunch. Can't they see that they are not welcome here? Why don't they just leave? However, there are more important things to do. I have unlocked some of the secrets of the frostspire shard. After all these centuries that have passed and the shattering of the frostspire, that released all the contained cold all over the isles, there is still power in this shard. I manipulated some of it's essence to slow my ageing process! What a triumph of science! That alone will make me the greatest magician of all times! But I am sure there is more about this shard! My apprentice sent some of her loyal followers to find more of the shards. The shattering of the frostspire must have produced thousands and thousands of them.\nAfter the first success, the research got really slow. I am able to tap the powers of the shards and drain them for my purposes but that is not very sufficient. One of the few direct effects, I can derive of the shards, is the slowed ageing process for me and my apprentice. Other things progress similarly slowly. There seems little left of the ancient civilisation that once retreated here. I begin to assume that they did not only use the frostspire to bind all that cold to create a hospitable environment, but they also used the contained cold to build their settlements. What a sight it must have been, a green and warm isle with cities of crystal gleaming ice! The shattering of the frostspire probably let this architecture erode over the centuries.

        "text": "I finally arrived at my destination. The isles are as cold and inhospitable as expected. I see this as a good sign though. All my investigations strongly hint that there is more about the myth of the frostspire than my ignorant colleagues want to believe. And it will be me who unlocks that secret.\nI made contact with some of the primitives that live here. Considering that my investigations here will bind me to these ice islands for some time, it might be a good idea to take some of them into my servitude. Yet, the primitives behaved quite unfriendly and it is questionable how I should be able to repay them for any services. However, pressing them into servitude is no true option. I have not the time to oversee a bunch of rebellious slaves that know the lands far better than I do. There has to be some other way.\nIt was easy to lure this greedy shaman witch into an alliance. Some display of my abilities combined with blandishments and empty promises and she was mine. Time will tell if this primitive will make a useful apprentice. Her influence among her people is undoubtedly considerable though.\nMarvellous! It was so easy to find the remains of the frostspire with the help of my local helpers! Of course it has become a place of importance in their primitive myths. Everything I encountered is true about the ancient myths! Sadly all-too-true. Not much is left from the magnificent frostspire itself and all signs of the ancient civilisation seem to be wiped out. But there is so much to be discovered and we just started.\nToday my apprentice gave me a holy item of her people's faith. At first, I was annoyed to be disturbed with such primitive nonsense but to my amazement the object was obviously a shard of the shattered frostspire itself! A short investigation showed me that it will take months to unlock the secrets of its inherent magic. I will need a more suitable base and more resources. In the meantime, settlers from Carlin have arrived. Some prospectors must have find ore in the mountains. Damn them, they are disturbing my research.",

        "text": "Things are going smooth and well for me. I was able to investigate the mines and caves. It seems that most creatures that are frozen in the ice are part of the demon army that fought the ancients. To my surprise, some of the demons are quite alive when they are freed from the ice. So I had to kill a handful of them. Unfortunately, now my barbarian helpers are too scared and won't enter the mines anymore. It is no great loss though. As far as I can tell, there are no significant shards hidden in the ice and I have no use for any rampaging demons. The chances to discover one of the ancients dead or even alive, are slim at best. Most likely, the majority of demons were frozen in ice at that moment the frostspire shattered. It is highly unlikely that any of the ancients was amongst them at that time. So after verifying some of the myth behind the frostspire, I could return to my actual work. The secrets of the shards will be mine, now that all distractions are eliminated.\nI am a bit absorbed in my studies. Everything else does not matter. I have spent more than two lifetimes in investigations of the shards. My results so far are amazing, though of little practical value. But it already raised the boundaries of my perspective of magic as a whole. My apprentice is growing more and more restless. She demands more knowledge, more power, more of everything. If I would not need her to maintain things here, I'd get rid of her one way or the other. But the way things are now, I have to live with this nuisance. I have no time to teach her new tricks. She knows enough to impress and frighten her superstitious people. I don't care about her fight with the people of Nibelor. I will not allow her to provoke a war that will further hinder my studies. There has been enough delay already.",

Now we will see how brave those sailors of Carlin are.

The climate does not suit those serpents too well, so they are not in a very good mood, I'd suppose.

At least I was able to unlock the healing and restoring abilities of the artefact. The annoying part is the function of the sarcophagus itself. I put much effort in figuring out how to open it. It seems that starlight is the key! The sarcophagus is easily accessible by starlight. At sunrise it seals itself and only opens again when the stars brighten the sky. Since my first tries in some dark ice cave, the sarcophagus won't open at all of course. My first experiments with the sarcophagus left me with a claustrophobic feeling. What if a cover of snow makes the sarcophagus inaccessible while I am inside? I will have to trust my apprentice to see that I am freed in such a case. It's a good thing my vain apprentice is very concerned about conserving her youth and beauty. For this reason, she has a vital interest in opening and accessing the sarcophagus on a regular basis. Still there is a slight risk, but that's a risk a scientist like me has to take I suppose.",

Instead of embattling a veritable army, you just freed some minor troops - by far not sufficient for the plans of our master. With the growing presence of Orshabaal in the realm of mankind, it is likely the seven will make their move soon. We must do everything to be faster. This army is pivotal for our success. For this reason you were chosen to lead the operation. However, everything you achieved in the past will mean nothing if you fail now.

On the other hand, considering how many resources of the cult this venture has taken, failure was not an option of course. The master will be pleased that you could take over the mines of these barbarians. The powers the master grant us make us invincible indeed. It's not surprising that you faced no retaliation of the barbarians. Their superstitions keep them from fighting for a place like the mines. Surprisingly that they took the effort to capture it in the first place. With the forces you already freed from the ice, you will be more than prepared for any attempt to retake the mines. However, keep a low profile there. We need a considerable army before we do anything. If the followers of good learn too early about our plans, everything would be put at stake. The master needs a great army, truly worth to fight for him and able to help him to fulfil his plan. Rest assured the master himself will see after you now and then, even if its just to keep all those demons in line. The lord of blades will soon unleash his anger upon the world and it will be us that raise out of the ashes of mankind as the rulers of a new age.\nPraised be the Triangle.",

        "text": "On perchts - Part I\nWhile superstitious men of past ages saw the percht as somewhat of a magically enhanced natural disaster, modern scholars managed to figure out more about their true nature. In popular belief the winter opens doorways to the home realms of the percht through which they enter our world to haunt its inhabitants. Through diligent research, however, solid proof emerged that the percht are denizens of our own plane. What we know as percht are not entities on their own but rather a shape of other spirits, that inhabit our own world. The origin of the percht are usually invisible minor spirits that inhabit our world since the dawn of time. Is is theorised that those spirits are randomly created as byproducts of creations of the gods. Therefore old texts describe such spirits metaphorically as sparks of the forges of creation. Such spirits are usually insubstantial and of minor power. Over time they adopt features and traits of their surroundings. Some may become attached to a spring or a clearing in the woods, while those in cities might become attached to houses or families. While some might manifest as pranksters, they usually are protective of their object of interest. Yet they might still develop their own view on things and might punish aberrations from their ideals with more or less malicious pranks. They are the source of tales of woodcutters, haunted with bad luck while trying to fell a particular tree or a sloppy baker that fails to clean up his bakery to receive a beating by unseen assailants in his bed. Most of those spirits are never noticed, though, and some are even helpful and benevolent. The problem arises when the cold of winter creeps into the land. Like water changes to ice, the cold turns those spirits into something entirely different. Their frozen form is by far more material and visible. Also their usually harmless attitude changes vehemently. The more the cold takes hold on them, the more they become one of the percht. In their frozen percht stage many of them become malignant and destructive. Also they become obsessed with cold and want to spread it over the whole world for all eternity. Percht are usually afraid of warmth and fire. It's also known that certain loud noises can cause them discomfort or even make them shatter. Some folk tale claim that they are afraid or ashamed by their own mirror image, although they seem not to care much about the presence and appearance of other percht. They are not really accustomed to their solid forms and usually try to fly and hover, which leads to an awkward jumping movement. Their senses are limited or they are just not used to them so they can sometimes be fooled by a disguise. They seem to have some holy places that they protect with powerful magic wards that dull the mind and cause nausea. One of those places is the lair of their powerful leader, others are just hideouts or ritual sites for their ghastly ceremonies to dull the sun.",

        "text": "On perchts - Part II\nThey usually carry some shed of their former selves and might still be obsessed with certain places or things like tidiness. This can only be deduced by their behaviour, however, since the percht seem unwilling or unable to communicate and some are known to repeat some phrases again and again. This seems more like the behavior of parrots then actual patterns of speech. Some percht are strong enough to retain a good portion of their former self and realise their predicament of been trapped in a solid form. Most of those percht are quite old and lived through numerous such transformations. With the coming of summer the percht begin to melt and eventually the originating spirit is set free again. Violence against a percht's solidly frozen body is another way to free the trapped spirits and so even the still sane percht might entice someone to attack and destroy them. In their percht state those spirits that embraced their new state are destructive and mildly dangerous. Their ultimate goal is to postpone or even better prevent the coming of spring. To this end they swear fealty to the oldest of their kind. The oldest tales predating mankind call her by many names. The frozen crone, the hag that rides the winter storm, mother death-chill or the matriarch of winter. In our days folklore simply calls her the percht queen. As such she has found her way into myth and faerie tales, usually as the antagonist, although a select few tales attribute her with some redeeming qualities like the admiration and even rewarding of diligence and duty or admitting her defeat in the face of true love. Though some assume she is just some old spirit that got trapped in the percht state for all eternity she herself gave other accounts. To some of her unwilling guests she claimed to have always been an entity of winter and cold and it was her who wove her spells into the cold that entrapped spirits to become her percht servants. She claimed that is is her who dulls the light of the suns and that there were ages in the past in which she ruled uncontested and the fiercest winter imaginable held the land in it's grip the whole year on, without any spring to be seen. She claimed that the coming of the next age of her regency is inevitable and eventually the work of her and her percht minions will succeed. While of course such outrageous claims of an age of ice are absurd at best, the threat of the queen and her percht is a real one and only vigilance and diligence can ward her off for another year.",

The land was lush and it's streams full of fish on which the old and wise bear fed well.\nBut one year the power of the percht queen was growing and the autumn turned chilling cold. Snow started falling and the streams froze over.\nThe hungry bear was unable to catch any fish at all, growing more and more desperate.\nWhen he was trying to break the thick ice in vain, he was mocked by the evil percht queen.\nShe taunted him about how her cold would cause him to starve.\nThe bear looked at her without any anger and was lost in deep thought.\nWhen the mocking triad of the crone had ended, he finally spoke to her.\n'Hear me glorious mother winter, praised be your reign. I would gladly be your servant until the seasons change but sadly I'm too weak and hungry right now.'\nThe flattered crone considered his words and the bear continued.\n'If your majesty would stay her hand until the moon tuns, I will happily enter your service until the end of winter.'\nThe ice hag pondered the idea and ultimately agreed that having the mighty bear as her humble servant would not only be useful but also emphasise her own status.\nWinter withdrew until the moon turned and the bear eagerly went fishing, catching and eating as much fish as never before.\nWhen the moon turned the bear had not shown up in the palace, the percht queen got furious.\nWith an entourage of percht she traveled to the lair of the bear to demand her due.\nBut the bear was soundly asleep and nothing the queen and her minions did could wake him up.\nThe bear had eaten so much that his hibernation was unbreakable.\nThe percht queen angrily retreated in defeat.\nWhen the bear awoke in the spring though he learned that the tries of the percht had coloured his fur as white as snow.\nThus, he became the father of all ice bears.",

Mostly harmless, they tend to destroy food supplies and can become dangerous in greater numbers to the bad equiped human.\nThe snake - The poisonous snakes hide in the woods and near the northern swamps. They usually can be found at the shores more often then in the isles centre. They are not too dangerous to a adventurer with some basic equipment. If poisoned it is a wise decision to run straight to the monk who guards the soul vortex, where everyone enters the world of Tibia, and ask for healing.\nThe spider - Similarly dangerous as the rat, the spiders were found by the first explorers of the isle and are native to Rookgard. They live above and beneath ground and tend to live and hunt in packs to increase their danger.\nThe wolf - There are some smaler wolf packs on this isle. Wolves are fast, tough and dangerous. Often they are the hunters and not the hunted on this island. It is a good decision to engage them in combat only with decent equipment and try to fight them only one on one.\nThe troll - Though intelligent in a limited way, the cowardish trolls are not a threat to our small outpost. They are able to create and use some basic equipment and quite tough to lesser weapons and unskilled fighters. Follow the advise to have mastered some basics in shielding, before you challenge even one of them.\nThe bear - Bears are hard to beat! Keep that in mind before challenging one. If you are unexperienced and have no good equipment, retreat is the tactic of choice. Best kill them in small hunting parties and use terrain to your advantage.",

It might be difficult to catch them and you might easily enter the territory of a local predator while chasing them.\nThe rotworm - A creature of decay that lives underground like its small cousin, the earthworm. Its toothed maw is a formidable weapon and rotworms have torn more then one adventurer to pieces. A horde of them might kill anyone, so great caution is advised while encountering them.\nOther beasts - It is certain, that other beast live in the dungeons of our isle.

Be careful while chasing an enemy, you might get hurt by his allies or other monsters and can't defend yourself while trageting him.\nTarget only the closest enemy, or you'll become confused and might not be able to defend yourself against other attacks.\nDifferent enemies require different tactics. While some are best to be fought in an agressive way, you should encounter others in a defensive way. Choosing between your attack styles also depends from your equipment -  if you have only little defense at your disposal, there is likely no point in fighting defensively and vice versa.",

This tough tree grows almost everywhere and can withstand the common storms in the harsh winter.\nAnother tree you can find is the dwarfenoak. The smaller cousin of the tibian oak is a fast growing tree and so the most common wood supply on rookgaard as well as on the continent.\nOnly botanists can distiguish the dwarfen oak from the strange rookgaard bananatree. On rookgaard there is an oak-like plant which fruits resemble bananas in shape and taste. No one can make out the difference of the fruits. To all people without knowledge in botanology: the only hint to find a bananatree is the white blossom flower that often seems to grow in a kind of symbiosis with the cherry tree.\nThe dragon tongue plant is easily spotted by its deep red blossoms and rumoured to be an useful reagent in various alchemical potions.\nThe swamp plants appear in such large number and variety that we didn't have a chance for extensive classification.",

But also agents of destruction and evil entered the world through this portal.

Destruction of all that others had built, slaying of new manifested souls as soon as they left the vortex.\nThe gods watched in grief what had become of their great accomplishment. And one day Uman and Banor combined their awesome forces and split the vortex.One strand now aimed to the isle of rookgaard, the other one remained aimed on the temple of Thais.\nFrom this day on the newborn heroes awakened on the holy and protected isle of rookgaard and only the stronger and better prepared souls could travel to the continent.\nGuided by omens an expedition of brave warriors from the thaian order of the knights of noodles traveled the perillious seas the the remote isle of rookgaardand discovered the new soulvortex.\nSoon this base was built and this fine academy founded.\nPraise the gods and our King.",

Into this desert entered Fardos, the creator, and Uman Zathroth, incorporating magic. Nobody knows where they came from or whether they always have existed and just awaked from the deep slumber of the infinity. Fardos fulfilled by the need to create and give birth. He stepped into existence and began immediately with the act of the creation, because he was fully creative power and impatient. His godly powers emerged from him and created, formed. But all his works slipped out of his hands as the void was everywhere. No single work was to last. Everything that he devised dissolved in the void even before it was completed. Uman Zathroth regarded his undertakings thoughtfully, because Uman Zathroth was wise and fullfilled with magic powers and insatiable hunger for knowledge, comprehension and enlightenment. He was a creature similar and nevertheless different to the clear working of the Fardos, because mysteries and secrets were the aspects of his being. Uman and Zathroth were two entities and nevertheless one. Uman was the light, bright aspect of the magic strength. His was the gift to work benign wonders. Zathroth however, his different - dark - side, was corruptive urge, the vain self purpose of magic, destructive and a desecration! This entity, which was two and one nevertheless, observed now the works of his companion in infinity.",

Uman consented only too readily, but Zathroth, the dark one of the twins, refused himself. Thus Fardos and Uman strived together to attempt the CREATION - however their laborings were not rewarded with success again. Just like before everything was drained away as soon as they created it, and Zathroth laughed full of contempt. The power however, which Uman and Fardos spent, did seep away in the universe-filling void. Nobody knows whether it was this power that lured another entity to them, whether it aroused this godly being, or whether in a mysterious way it created this entity. In any event, suddenly the enormous entity Tibiasula rose from the void and examined the two other godly beings. Fardos and Uman welcomed Tibiasula as their sister and admired her, because she was the perfect unity of the elements. Zathroth however fumed with silent hate, as he didn't want to share the void with one more entity.",

But no matter how hard the brothers tried, Nornur couldn't appear to be much more than a shadow of a ghost.\nThus Nornur decided to create creatures in order to reveal himself. Thus the spiders came into the world, which are able to web their ghostlike spiderwebs, which copy Nornurs shape, and thus praise and honor him.\nAlso Uman and Sula, the sea, found together, and they conceived Bastesh, the unfathomable one. She was exceedingly beautiful, and the Godly were astonished. But Fafnar, the sun, looked upon all this beauty full of envy! When the newly born Bastesh looked up to her, she attacked her with fiery claws in the face and scratched it  readfully. Probably Bastesh would not have survived the attack of her sister, had not the other Gods hurriedly come to help and driven away the ravishing Fafnar.\nBastesh however was frightened and disfigured. Full of fear she fled into the embrace of her mother Sula. In the depths of the seas the unfathomable one hides herself since that time, and little is known about her and her workings. Only the fact that the sea has been populated since that time by numerous creatures, may tell us that Bastesh seems to create these in the depth.

Thus Brog created further life, imitiating his shape, in order to please him, and so the cyclops entered the world. Zathroth however was angered, because he thought the cyclos stupid and awkward. Too little trouble did they spread in the world, because they quarried in Tibia for metals and enjoyed to process it with fire and force. They were too few for his likes, because they hardly grew in numbers. Thus Zathroth reprimanded his blockheaded son and ordered him to create new life. For he himself still could not understand the secret of life. Under his guidance the first trolls, numerous and vexatious, developed but still without the malicious cunning, which Zathroth desired. Next father and son therefore created the orcs. And the orcs turned out just like the dark God wanted them. They flowed over Tibia, spread out and began to devastate it.",

But a small part of Uman-Zatroth, a godly fragment separated itself due to this pulling and strugglig, and it assumed the shape of Kirok, which one would call the crazy one. Kirok was from precipitous, scizophrenic nature. On the one hand he was brilliant and creative, on the other hand one he was ludicrous and full of folly. Thus Kirok became the protection patron of the scientists on the one hand, and the jesters and jokers on the other hand.\nMeanwhile the gruesome children of the dark gods raged more and more savagely,and the devastation of the world continued without cessation. Some of the other gods did not want to witness anymore, how their creation was troubled and subjected by the creatures after the spirit of Zathroth, and some decided to do something about that. Crunor created the wolves in order to protect his forests against the orcs, but these were too numerous! Only in the deepest forests and in wild herds the wolves learned to defeat their bipedal opponents.",

Like the orcs before them, now the undead covered the body of the mother Tibia, and his children, the rats, were Urgith's messengers and scouts. Then however Uman and Tibia united, as it had been agreed upon, and Toth was born. Toth became the guardian of the dead ones and sent his large worms which began to devour the undead.

Just as strong and powerful as these peoples were, they were one-sided and of little flexibility. Worse still: Some creatures succumbed to the temptations of Zathroth about power and great knowledge. They switched sides, and rumor has it that the most powerful of the Ancients were hurled out of this world by the good Gods for their betrayal to suffer eternally in the sphere, which was created in order to punish them for their misdeeds, and changed to what nowadays is called the daemons.

Banor however chose the noblest of the mortal ones, Kirana, as its wife, and she bore him Elane, which possessed as much virtue as combat and magical powers. And she became the first of the noble paladins. Until our times the leader of the paladins is in honors to her a woman and assumes the honorary name Elane.",

By means this mystic of gate souls from planes of existence far, far away of Tibia could be called in order to assume the shape of heroes. With these champions as leaders the humans turned the tables in the great war. \nThey alone under all the mortals had the possibility of becoming similar to Banor, uniting power and cunning.

Only gradually the recovering sections of the old world started to rise from the nebulas of time, awakened the old races and old frights back to life. It is said that the city of Tibia was the first to rise again, barren of almost all life, without all magic, on a tiny island, deserted and almost devoid of life ... and nevertheless full of age-old secrets. And soon\nafterwards life returned to the world. Also via the portal of souls old and new heroes found their way to Tibia. Gradually larger sections of the old world emerged from the nebulas, further natures and miracles. But the world is still far from its former splendour and size, and we live in times of change. What today is still natural, may as soon as tomorrow be only a legend, what today is still fantasy, may already tomorrow be reality. But hear ye and listen: Bad spirits also arrived and still arrive by the portal in our realm, in order to do mischief in human shape. Thus one has to face many dangers, and often the world appears to be cruel and hostile.",

As the greedy gnome saw that she was carrying a bag full of finest bread and a flask of wine, he pretended to be starving and begged the little girl for food and water in a way anoying as only gnomes can be (and that's pretty anoying). But the girl was warned of treacherous gnomes by a valiant huntsman she met before and she quickly ran away from the greedy little gnome. The gnome became angry but was afraid to steal from her, because she might have been stronger than him. So he wandered into the woods cursing as only gnomes can curse (and that's pretty ugly). By chance he almost stumbled over a sleeping bard. Quickly figuring out the magical nature of the flute lying near the sleeping bard, he stole it as quickly as only a gnome can do (and that's pretty quick). Using the magic flute he lured a pack of wolves to the little girls grandmas house and let the beasts chase both into the wilderness and laughed wickedly as only gnomes can laugh (and that's pretty wicked). Laughing the gnome gulped the wine and swallowed the bread as fast as only gnomes can (and that's pretty fast). So he lived in the woods and molested squirrels happily ever after.",

I would have done the same thing to others  a few hundred years ago. But now I'm tired and would almost welcome death to halt this never-ending cycle of intrigue and bids for power. I never imagined how hollow all those things would become that I carved for so long. But after losing and winning all over and over again, it all grows stale. All my accomplishments are only adding to the amount of reasons why I have to watch my back. After gaining all this power, you have to invest a considerable deal of it just to secure it. Though you then have the power to make decisions, the good ones only lead to envy and minions undermining them, and the bad ones might give a rival the chance to strike at you. However, this should not turn into a philosophical treatise of some sort; neither become an excuse for what I have done. I have committed all atrocities deliberately and freely. I feel no regret; but seeing the futility of our ambitions, I feel incredibly tired and disgusted by our trivial ways. Perhaps I have outlived the timespan I can endure. With stolen life-force and dreams I prolonged my life for so long that I often cannot tell what really happened and what I might have imagined, or what is a lie told so often and casually that I forgot the truth. While I watch the newest bid for power of my people, I write this down to tell the people of other times about what happened here.\nWhile I feel that the recent plans of my people will not play out well, I think they will add to all the futility in my lifetime and our people's, and that whatever happened here will be completely forgotten to all but the uncaring gods and, perhaps, some of our surviving enemies. I write this down in the tongue of the gods, hoping that their vanity alone is enough to ensure that this gift to their followers be preserved. I write this down on mere paper instead of using the dream crystals of my people. This way it might escape the watchful eyes of my colleagues long enough to outlive them.\nMuch could be told about my people. It would fill volumes and yet only scratch the surface. But this is nothing I could accomplish at all, and nothing I'd even care to try. If I am right, my people will be dead soon enough and just another side note of history. I somewhat relish the thought that we will be the subject of speculation and myth, so it suits me well that those who will come after us are not too familiar with our doings in history. That being said, a few things should be mentioned just in case we are completely wiped out from not only existence, but history as well.\nFirst of all, the name of my people is nothing meant for vocal chords. It is a thought pattern, half a dream and untranslatable into any tongue.\nAs is the language we use with our own people. It was a hard thing to learn to communicate with others. It is somewhat disgusting , having to rely on grunting and gasping to communicate with our allies. The latter gave us many names, rarely though to flatter us. Dreamstealers, dreamvampires, dreamshapers and so many, many more that I've forgotten them. Most of the times I preferred to refer to us simply as the dreamers.",

        "text": "My people were always proud and cruel. Not entirely inhabitants of this world; only the passing to and fro other realms was always natural for us. We were no great warriors, but we served in our own ways in the god wars. In the service of the gods, we helped those allied to Zathroth. We were spies, messengers, advisors; and we manufactured weapons of war in our own, special way. I was one of the first. A leader, a priest, a prophet. Yet I always let others do the outstanding things. I fancied pulling strings and being the secret initiator of many things; but I'm not sure now how much of this is true or some kind of paltry excuse I convinced myself to believe. All the great achievements of our race were initiated by others.  But I have been there, and outlived them all. Early on, my people developed a mastery of dream, unparalleled before. We shaped dreams, and dragged them into reality. We constructed dreams, with the only purpose to use them as facilities to forge other dreams in them. The concept has become so natural and trivial to me that it is hard to explain. It is like explaining colours to a blind man.\nSuffice it to say that we used dreams, both self-made and stolen, to shape the world and provide us with shelter, sustenance, tools and weapons. Dreams soon became the currency and life blood of our society. We were never numerous though, and managed to convince the leaders of our side that we were too valuable to be wasted on the battlefield. So we dwelled in our city made of stolen dreams, and schemed. Sometimes against our mutual foe, sometimes against our allies, and sometimes within our own. For several centuries this kept me occupied and entertained. We built the great dream catcher, our greatest accomplishment. A monument of our power. With its might, incomprehensible to people bound only to one world, our might was amplified in unimaginable ways. We rose in power, higher and higher; rivalling that of Zathroth's favourite pets, the demons. This led to a few clashes between them and us. We managed to hold our own until now; and this is what probably will lead to our downfall.\nA short while ago, the council was approached with the request that we use the arts of our race to construct something entirely new: a prison made of dreams, using the veils and barriers of other worlds to dampen the power of all creatures, and lock them in and torture them for all eternity. We did not question this request. It was much too tempting to grow even more powerful, and so we consented. Little did we know that everything was staged and we were purposely misled.",

        "text": "My people dived into this new venture with ambition. Resources were sent by other races, even knowledge was reluctantly shared by them. Prisoners and renegades were sent to us to do tests and experiments with them. Little of what we requested was ever denied. Even I was mildly thrilled for a while by the sheer novelty of the enterprise.\nThen strange things began to happen. Plans were slightly changed, requests added to projects and the advisors led certain researches onto different paths that were not agreed upon. I would not have lived that long if I had not developed a sense for things going amiss. It became more and more obvious that we were not aware of the full truth. The increase of power levels for the prisons, for example, had, step by step, risen enormously. These were no longer prisons meant for some minor captives - these prisons were powerful enough to even give a lesser god some trouble. And there was more. Additions brought in by other races, things we did not even understand, were added. More and more demon 'advisors' stayed in the city all the while we heard about an increased fierceness of the battles elsewhere. I knew something big was happening. I was just undecided what to do with the knowledge. My first impulse was to run and hide, to watch from safety. But then I realised how tired I was of scheming and hiding. Yes, this was new, not home-made as usual; but for all its novelty it was still the same. I decided not to run but to stay and watch, and face what might come.\nSoon I was more and more convinced that I was right; and when some of the demons approached us for a secret meeting, I was only mildly curious about what might be revealed. However, I can't tell what happened then and there. Gods were involved and binding vows were spoken, so that even now I can't go into details. I can merely circumvent it through stating that most of the secret things spoken about have already happened by now and are common knowledge.\nI had been right that the prison was more than just that. It was meant to be a trap. And it was meant not primarily for our enemies, but our allies. Well, at least for the traitors amongst them. And who the traitors were, well, that was earth-shaking news.",

        "text": "A cadre of the most powerful demon princes in existence, actually all of them, were declared traitors. Seemingly they had not defected to the enemy but a third power, of which nothing was related. All we had to know was that we had to take out the most formidable force on our own side. The sheer power of these beings had always been something we feared and coveted. We were assured we would have all the assistance that we could. We would be supported by the next finest batch of demons at the disposal of our gods. I was sceptical that the pupils of the very creatures we planned to capture might be of any help. But we were assured of their loyalty. Much of the plan and its detail were based on a wretched thing of a demon who called himself Bazir. This Bazir and his about two dozens allies were handpicked from the demon armies; chosen for their diverse talents and unwavering loyalty - and very probably for their lust to replace their former masters.\nWe could do nothing but comply. In this stage, no one could have walked out in possession of such information and just stayed out of the whole thing. Now we were bound. Bound to an uneasy alliance at best. We had always competed with the demons; we never were close friends and in certain areas too similar to get along with each other at all. But we needed their magic, their knowledge, their sheer power for the trap to work.\nEven while we were talking about what we had just learned, my people began to plot and scheme. I kept quiet. I could imagine the demons we just allied with a few moments ago doing the very same thing, at the very same time. That was when I knew we were all doomed. Not one of us was going to get out of this alive. Treachery was so natural to us and our allies that there was no other way, no other possibility.\nThe weight of stolen centuries and cycles of treachery almost crushed me when I first realised this.\nThe sweet thing was that the ever-turning wheel was about to break, that all would finally come to an end. That was why I stayed, in the end. \nI stayed to await the end of all things that I knew. I might have had a faint hope of escaping the catastrophe, that something new and fresh would rise out of the ashes, and that I could be part of it.\nBut in my heart I knew that I would never be fresh and new. I would always be the same old dreamer, trapped in cycles of schemes and treachery.\nHowever, things progressed impressively.

And we were prepared to let the trap spring. Of course we suspected treachery and double-crossing. I knew the plans to secure the remaining allied demons in other, secretly built prisons. They would be as weak and vulnerable as never before. With the princes gone and their most powerful loyalist demons taken out, we would rule undisputed. After all, we held the keys to the prisons.\nOf course the other side plotted, too. My people were so engrossed in their own schemes they ignored the possibility that the plans of their rivals might be as dangerous as their own.\nThey were wrong to do so, of course.\nWhen the trap was sprung - the oaths even now prevent me to go into details - the demons did not show up at all. I had never trusted this Bazir, but I thought that at least some of the others, more furious like Apocalypse, Lurin, Infernatil and Vazrok, would be too eager to test their might, to hold back.\nThe first prince was caught completely unaware when the trap sprang. This was almost too easy. But then, hell broke loose - literally. Our nightmare creatures were no match for the princes and their retinue. They were so powerful! We had kept ourselves out of most direct battles of the war and were completely unprepared for such a display of power and cruelty. Within seconds all seemed lost, when the demons finally intervened, obviously in panic that everything was at stake now.\nBut it was almost too late. The princes had cut a good part of my people into pieces and alarmed their minions in the city. There was slaughter everywhere.\nI saw demons being ripped apart by the princes. Sheldrax and Ashfalor were both shredded to pieces before my very eyes by Sephorath, prince of agony. Several parts of one of the demons crawled away, obviously animated by some magic to preserve its life; but there was hardly anything left to be preserved.\nTulax the mighty, Jebborn, Semir, they all fell like flies swatted away.\nHere and there, a prince succumbed to the sheer number of allied forces; but the fight looked desperate for our side.\nThen the great nightmare beasts were unleashed. Though not truly rivalling a prince in power, still they were unknown to them and hard to defeat. Although no match in a direct confrontation, they managed to distract them long enough for some of us to desperately unleash all the stolen dreams from the dream catcher.\nAll our wealth, the essence of our existence and the harvest of centuries, blown away in less than a minute.\nBut the devastation on mind and body was enormous. Everyone caught in the blast was weakened if not unconscious. I saw the minds of several people I had known for years as rivals go blank forever.\nI was blind, too. Not only physically, but also mentally.\nWhen mind and sight became clear again, a considerable time had passed.",

Several had fused into even more grotesque creatures, some of them spawning lesser horrors over and over, until they dissolved. But their increased power had brought down many of the subdued princes. Demons who had previously fled the carnage caused by the princes closed in, like Zitraks smelling blood. They swarmed over the fallen princes with ravenous force.\nNot more than ten or so of our treacherous allies had survived the slaughter, but their minions were seemingly in endless supply. I had not been aware they had brought so much backup forces into our city.\nI was confused. Still I could not feel anything and stumbled through the streets that were distorted by what I imagined a storm of unbound dreams. \nWhen I found shelter, the sound of battle in the city already grew fainter.\nI looked down to see that my body was mutilated and my life force sapping out. But that was something I welcomed.\nMy tiredness in mind is now shared with this body. I would not create a new one, even if I could.\nI will allow things to run their course.

The council advised prudence, to stay vigilant as we always have. The head seems to want the contrary. In the time between this meeting and the last, he ordered to built at least two additional forges already and demanded Cannos to copy all of our previous records at least twice. It's not manageable anymore, I already contacted one of my suppliers but it's just not possible to press any harder. Furthermore, it does not look like this dispute is going to end well, the council will not have anymore of these escapades. As was evident by several open remarks or to quote Sentif: \"If headmaster Dolis conceits himself to be some kind of benevolent autocrat, that's fine but that would also mean the end of his role as the head of this society. We are not a... (loud interjections) ... please, we are not a royal household, Dolis is not a king and this is certainly not a war! (louder and impertinent interjections)\".\nThe general consent was that if Dolis continues to press the research, the council will be forced to take steps. The headmaster defended himself, and I quote: \"We do not yet know what awaits us and we cannot afford to take this lightly. The more we know about the this entity, the better and the faster we learn, the safer we can sleep. (very loud and sometimes mocking remarks, several rebukes from council-members towards the audience) We have evidence that (laughter) ... evidence that this being is sentient and watching us - but for how long? It may be watching us, following our every word, every snide remark of yours and everything we plan - right now! (abrupt silence in the audience, the headmaster paused). Now, I will bow to the council but you cannot stop me in taking my own precautions. In the interest of this whole society and everyone's future we try to protect, we have to contain the Planestrider. (Dolis leaves, the council members jump from their seats with harsh remarks, the audience bursts into loud discussions).\nPersonal comment: the Head Planegazer is growing weary of waiting, he demands results. His reckless behaviour will endanger the whole society as well as himself. He could jeopardise everything including everyone's safety, he so valiantly tries to protect. We can only hope he will abide to the will of the council. We all share a common goal, this is no group you can just leave, nor can we put any reprisals on our members. Our credo is to prevent panic, not to give it more room. \"Canvas your knowledge, veil the end.\" Dolis should remember what this is all about.\nPreliminaries: I will talk to forgemaster Logur to continue analysing the replicas and enhance our equipment. We will see what we can do but it's not possible to go any faster, we're working day an night as it is.",

However, I don't trust in such modern, experimental stuff and would prefer our old tried and true stuff, even if it seemingly was less efficient, in the long run it had prevailed.\nThose Gnomes know a thing or two about mushrooms and their crystal stuff.

It even has to be assumed that the different species encountered in one form or the other work together. This gives more credit and weight to the initial gnomish warnings about this area. In addition to the species new to us, our forces also clashed with some creatures that were already known from past encounters in the depths of the world. All this strongly hints that the gnomes are right and that this is all orchestrated by what they ominously call 'those below'.\nThe pressure they put on our forces is growing considerably with each day and there is no telling if it might ever stop. In the contrary, I'd think that the real coordinated attacks are yet to come.\nEven with the abundance to ores in this area, I recommend to abandon and seal this area once and for all.",

At first it seems the increasingly numerous and frequent waves of enemies swarming our lines would eventually overrun us. These gnomish crystal-resonators they brought with them bought us some precious time by scaring away some of the monsters, bringing their advance in significant disarray. When our troops arrived, they were still at the brink of overrunning us. Only a valorous charge into their midst broke their momentum. With the lack of the enemy's discipline, their ranks were lacking any cohesive formation and our forces could push through to inflict massive damage. Our vanguard managed to identify some individuals that would be called leaders in armies that are more formal. They even cornered one of them and under heavy casualties wounded them severely which forced them to retreat. Sadly the remaining vanguard got cut off from our forces in the fight and was completely wiped out by the enemy forces.",

Whether the enemy is gathering new forces or waiting for new orders, now is the time to act. We have to use that little breathing space we won by fighting back to bring the battle to the enemy. The gnomes managed to gain vital intelligence on the enemy and we made our own observations in the fights. The major figures on the hostile side are seemingly several leaders that, aside from being a lethal threat on their own, served as some kind of rallying spot for the enemies armies.\nA certain three of them have been identified as crucial for the efforts of 'those below'.\nLacking proper alternative names the boys have named the incomprehensible creatures after likewise incomprehensible titles of human nobility. They are identified as the Count of the Core, the Duke of the Depths and the Baron from Below. As long as we can put enough pressure on them, the attacks might be kept at a manageable rate. It is vital though, that we strike soon and strike hard.\nThere are several more formidable creatures in the ranks of the enemy but they seem more like loners and encounters with them are rare. It seems wise to avoid them when possible and let special strike teams handle them if the need arises.\nGiven that the gnomes are more familiar with the enemy, it might be possible that they are not exaggerating when they claim that the enemy is prepared to utilise even worse methods to annihilate our defences. If they are right, the enemy plans to flood our tunnels with lava and that is a threat no axe nor steel could hope to fight.",

They did surprisingly well - until they got into the inevitable mess we expected. Since they stubbornly insisted to remain in the midst of trouble, we had to come to their rescue of course. The dwarves proved astonishingly capable in fighting the threat but in the long run they would have succumbed to the constant onslaught unless we brought in our ingenuity and expertise. Since the dwarves were somewhat reluctant to let go of their proven tactics, we had to figure out how to reinforce them in the best way possible. Naturally we came up with some solutions that fused our expertise and equipment with those of the dwarves to a solid defence. \nNow we seem somewhat stuck in the fight, no side gaining the upper hand. Experience tells us, however, that those below won't be idle for long and the next waves of attacks will be more fierce and long. Eventually even the best defences will wear off.\nFurthermore, our sources tell us that the real threat is even more sinister. We located several sources of tremendous heat in the depths. We encountered something like that some time before: it always preceded the rise and eruption of large lava steams into a confined cave system. It seems that our old enemy is using old tricks once again. The location of the heat sources seems easy enough, yet to get to them and possibly destroy the mechanisms they use to raise the lava is the hard part.\nWe do agree with the dwarves that only swift and decisive action can win the day.

It will take some time for everyone to adjust to the procedure but it was necessary. For the cause.\nDay 56: Not everyone seems to get used to how the gates work. I refrain from making this any simpler, our security and safety is at risk. Not to mention the whole operation. You just need to have the right coordinates in your sphere. It's not hard and I certainly won't give them any hints.\nDay 68: A great day down here today. That is... if it is actually daytime. I really hope I didn't miscount or something. At least I know which day it is. Note: ah I forgot to write down if it's a weekday or not, I'll have to ask some of the other Planegazers next time they come through here.\nDay 131: Rice and vegetables, every day rice and vegetables. I cannot... I just don't want to eat the same stuff everyday. My trusty Erna here will be a tasty change on the menu.\nDay 187: No pig on the menu this year, Erna will be spared. Since I don't like sheep meat eather, I'll just have rice and vegetables today. Again.\nDay 225: Nobody came through this week. Maybe next week, it's getting quite boring here.\nDay 269: I wonder if I can ask for a day off? Nobody cam through for over a month now, guess I will just stay here. Someone needs to secure this entrance.\nDay 342: I couldn't bring myself over eating Erna. She was pregnant and... well it's more pigs now! So at least I got some new company. The sheep did produce a lot of wool this year.\nDay 378: Nobody comes. I wonder what everyone's doing? Where is everyone? Should I leave my post? I don't know what to do. I'm not authorised to just enter and take a look. But what if I'm forced to one day? When will that day be?\nDay 425: I cannot leave my post. I decided to stay here and wait for whatever happens. There must be a reason for this, a serious reason. These halls were bustling with fellow Planegazers and I bet they still are. They just won't come out for... some reason. I will stay here and hold out.\nDay 426: I cannot wait here any longer. I need to go in myself and take a look, something's not right. I will leave my diary here for... well, I guess it won't be of much use to anyone, since I didn't write anything about how all this works! Ha!

I ordered my team to focus on the places we already know as being visited by the Planestrider. The original sites of its arrival are probably the most visited, yet not very well documented. If we find the origin of the cubes, we find the origin of this being itself. Yet all the cubes we found so far seem incomplete.\n(extensive maps may have been drawn here, time has rendered them completely unreadable, what is still there seems to not make much sense)\nComments on active projects:\n(the first 20 or so notes are mostly uninteresting and common observations)\n#26: Dimensional Beings\nWe found evidence of what we assume to be visitors from another dimension. A whole race of interdimensional beings has been traced to an uncharted and unexplored content approximately far to the north-east. Travellers have confirmed sightings of hideous creatures with multiple lags, mouths and eyes, devouring or carrying large amounts of energy. All reports described very unnatural beings appearing out of nowhere.\n#26/2,addendum: Successful Capture\nOne specimen was found bound and half-dead on a ship. The captain abandoned the remainder of his crew on this floating coffin only shortly after it arrived in the Venore harbour so we do not know who captured it or how it got onto the ship. It must have been a truly daunting task, however, for as we tried to pull it out of the ship's hold, it came alive and started attacking us immediately, causing a lot of damage. We managed to contain it using one of the advanced holding cells our craftsmen designed. Studying this thing may bring us one step closer to the truth. What are these things and are they the origin of all this?\n#26/3,addendum: One Step Back\nWhile we can confirm the specimen from 26/2 is not from our dimension, it is not in any way connected to the being we're after. I conclude that the Planestrider may not even be a \"being\" in the actual sense. All things considered it may be more of a \"concept\" but to what end? What is the purpose and why this trail of unmistakable evidence on its existence? The words it offers us are a part of something it wants us to know. It must all be connected to form a meaning, a message. It is clear that we are close to decipher it but what if it is not even in our hands anymore, what if it never was?

It was completely empty but we cannot deem it safe as we had only very limited time to explore the area. Note to the craftsmen: we NEED to find a way to stay underwater for a longer time-span.

We expected some form of resistance but weren't prepared to encounter intelligent beings with weapons. One specimen could be injured and was successfully captured. All further excursions have been withdrawn until we have recovered from this skirmish. Work on analysing the creature and adding to our existing research continues in the safety of our laboratories.

I have yet to find a complete exemplar. They MUST be the key. One of my coadjutors assumes it is some kind of map, I would say it is a weapon but it may also be a key. If the map theory is true, however, there could be a way to get to the origin, we just have to look hard enough for a complete cube. An incomplete cube seems to not have any function at all.\n#29/2, addendum: Missing Pieces\nWe cannot find a complete exemplar.

His journey to Tiquanda took place before he found something in the remains of a bonfire. He discovered something in the remains of a bonfire on a trip that happened before he got hold of a painting of a gozzler.\n2. Once, something in a fresh corpse caught his eye. This neither happened on his journey to the Ice Islands nor when he visited Oramond.\n3. The werewolf amulet was not the result of a magic experiment.\n4. The savant found the opticording sphere neither in a forgotten loot bag nor in a dustbin.\n5. He obtained something through fishing on the journey that took place right after he had returned from Fiehonja and directly before he set out to the place where he acquired the werewolf amulet.\n6. The ghost detector was neither a souvenir from Razachai nor from Roshamuul.\n7.

        "text": "Those Below, What We Know (I)\nSince the enemy that we know as 'those below' seem to only act through vassals, it is hard to say when they were encountered first. Seemingly random events in the past might have been more or less their doing unbeknown to anyone. In the light of recent events theories have spread that link disasters of the past and monster incursions to the doings of 'those below'. In fact, since no one was expecting a guiding hand behind those events, there is no evidence to support that. The great cave-in of the starsilver claim is cited the most amongst such instances. Indeed the few tunnels that remain from these mines are overrun by creatures that are counted to the forces of those below. Still, it's possible that they are simply lured by seismic activity and just moved in. The gnomes were the first to make out patterns in certain events and attacks on their deepest hold. When their counter efforts were met in kind and often countered, they began to suspect a guiding force behind all of this. Their concentrated efforts were answered by massive counterblows that required massive coordination and logistics, not available to the mostly primitive creatures they fought. Even countermeasures against cave-ins and volcanic activity were sabotaged. Despite all gnomish efforts the enemy activity just grew until the gnomes had to pull back when the effort and casualties were no longer worth the gain from those bases. At first only random holds in the deepest of regions were lost. The frequency of occurrences did rise and at some point establishing new outposts did no longer cover up the losses. The gnomes retreated from the deeper areas and put more efforts into new bases closer to the surface to compensate. With their somewhat nomadic lifestyle the gnomes were able to handle the new situation quite well but since the threat is spreading more and more, they see themselves under pressure. With the deep mining on the rise for the last several hundred years, the dwarfish forces on the other hand are beginning to encounter more and more of the minions from below on their own. Mining technology that was safe and reliable for millennia have started to fail, due to the unnatural seismic activity and rise of lava levels.",

        "text": "Those Below, What We Know (II)\nWith all the efforts to scout the enemy, little could be learned. Especially since behind the enemy's frontline the earth temperature is rising at an alarming rate and former deep territory that was once settled by gnomes is now immersed by lava. It seems that whatever is leading the attacks is living behind or even in that lava.\nWe do know that the enemy makes use of numerous creatures. Often the creatures they control are commonly dangerous but rare and display far less aggressive behaviour. They don't gather in hordes, let alone they'd attack with any coordination or in league with other creatures. It is unknown how exactly those creatures are controlled or guided but there seems to be a connection to the mighty leader-like creatures they employ amongst their minions. If they are eliminated, coordination and aggressiveness levels drop almost immediately.\nThe fact that a lost tribe of dwarves has been enslaved and bred for war purposes hints how they might have attained control over other subterranean races, sentient or not. There is strong evidence that they actually breed their minions actively and there is some sort of indoctrination involved. Given that they breed the lost dwarves to creatures of low intelligence and high aggressiveness, it is likely they have similar procedures for other creatures as well.\nTheir choice of generals gives other hints abut heir nature. In at least one case they employ the assistance of a fallen gnome. His mind and body were heavily altered in unknown ways. Though in charge of leading their troops he displayed behaviour that usually would be considered mad. Also even he was somehow linked to the coordination of the hostile forces. Although as a gnome he didn't previously display any kind of telepathic ability. So it can be assumed that the other so called generals they employ are also heavily altered specimens of their kind. They probably don't resemble the appearance of 'those below' which leaves us with no clue how they look.",

        "text": "Those Below, What We Know (III)\nThe only enemies that could be captured and questioned were some of the lost. They displayed a tremendous pain tolerance and lack of fear but their intelligence levels seemed seemingly frighteningly low. With limited vocabulary and interaction it seemed that they see 'those below' rather as some form of primal gods of fire and pain than as creatures. It seems likely they never saw or interacted with them directly.\nConquered territory saw an increase of heat levels. This went hand in hand with the level of occupation of the territory. Where they could be repelled, the heat level did not rise significantly, so a natural cause can be ruled out. What is unknown is if the heat comes with the presence of those below or they need it to move into an area and raise it in some way.\nThe nature of 'those below' still remains an enigma. From the little we know only some assumptions can be made. They seem to need or enjoy extreme heat levels and they actively expand their territory, not accepting or attempting any form of negotiation. Their minions behave and communicate (as little it may be) in an entirely enigmatic and alien way so that the reasoning and thinking of 'those below' can't easily be predicted.\nThe need to spread their territory hints at a rather numerous race that constantly needs more room or resources.\nThe dominance over powerful beings they employ as generals points at an immense personal power level of the individuals or the race as a whole.\nThey can manipulate and transform individual beings somehow, perhaps even for breeding those transformations into species.\nTheir minions, like the lost, require crude, self-made weapons that rather rely on the little skill that race has left than outside sources. Other forms of equipment, as few as have been found so far, hint at even more alien origins and are dissimilar to commonly known tools or machinery. Even those objects, however, might be the remainder of a craft that one of their subjugated minion races once possessed and is probably only a mere shadow of the craftsmanship those races were previously capable of.\nTheir forces show no regard to themselves or others. A retreat can only be enforced when they deem an effort no longer viable. What is viable or not follows no discernible pattern. Whereas sometimes a brimming ore mine was left in peace after a rag and tag band of defenders fended off some invaders, they sacrificed legions of minions to conquer some abandoned cave, far away from anything of importance.\nIn this state of the war it has to be mentioned that 'those below', their origin, their look and their motives continue to be an enigma. As their attacks and the pressure they put on other races rises, the importance of such information becomes more and more a priority. How this information can be acquired though, is still something that is desperately debated upon.",

        "text": "Dear Flora,\nI just returned from my visit to the kings court in Thais. Along with other nobles I was invited to a diner with the crown prince of Thais Rodmund II. He seems a rather shy and reclusive boy. We had not the chance to talk much to him but if it were not for his advisors, the brothers Wisbert and Madol, the heads of the church of Uman and Zathroth respectively, I'd fear for the wellbeing of the realm. The boy seems pale and unhealthy. He had obvious problems to follow any conversation and word at the court is that the untimely death of his father made the boy even more timid then he was before. We were assured though, that the council of nobles and the two grand priests of the both most influential churches were guiding him and leading his hand. The brothers Wisbert and Madol were indeed impressive men of wisdom and charisma. Their eloquence was almost intimidating and beyond their calm demeanor I sensed some kind of animosity between them. Perhaps it was just their way though and their witty remarks and retorts fooled me. They are brothers after all. Both are men with vision though and when they both fully agreed on how our realm should handle the challenges ahead I'm confident these brilliant men will grant security and stability for our beloved country.\nI also visited the royal stables and let me tell you, that you'd might be in for a nice surprise when I return home.\nCount Allstio sends his regards. He feels sorry that he won't be able to attend our summer feast but he'll be on an expedition to some foreign land by then. You know Allstio and how secretive he can be (I even heard he built some sort of cryptlike retreat in that awful Greenclaw Swamp) so this is all of information I can offer you.\nI hope you and the kids are well,\nyours,\nDargen",

        "text": "The dwarfs, who are well versed in the depths of the earth, know strange tales of weird places and creatures they encountered in the bowels of Tibia. Some of them might be discarded as fairy tales (of course not in the opinions of the dwarfs), but I dare to say that most of them are true. There is one kind of story which you can hear by all kind of dwarven tribes, all describing the same things. These stories tell about some vast structures underground that seem to be the remains of an ancient civilisation. The long-abandoned structures in these stories share striking similarities. Oddly, these structures are found at places in totally different environments and often also far away from each other. Some widely travelled dwarfs claim to have seen similar things in remote continents and isles. Sometimes only a few bricks at some odd place hint at one of these ancient structures. Others, however, are well preserved ruins in which even some rooms are still recognisable. Obviously, the ancient race that once lived in these structures had colonies all over the known world. Some theories try to link these structures to the extinct Morad race - a race of nomadic builders that supposedly left their traces all over the world. The recent researches of Fordworth, though, seem to prove that the Morad used a fast growing crystal substance for their buildings. These crystals, however, only lasted for a dozen years. So nothing the Morad had built would have endured until today. If we compare the aforementioned dwarven records with those of several dungeon crawling adventurers, however, we learn that some of these ruins, sometimes separated by continents, were inhabited by a brutish race of savages. It seems likely that whoever built those structures brought these creatures with them to serve as guardians and workers. When the creators abandoned their structures, they left their servants behind. They, however, were unable to maintain them properly. But who are the ones that built these structures? It seems unlikely that there was another nomad race. Why would they leave their servants behind when moving to another location? My theory is that the structures were used to gather resources. Just like the dwarfs, this race sent out many prospectors to look for a specific resource. Whenever they encountered a vein, they stationed some constructors and their workers. Since there are still workers left at some of these places, the race must have abandoned them in a haste. This of course suggests that valuable information and artefacts might have been left, too, some of them probably in the hands of these brutish workers. This is certainly worth an expedition. If I were to find a sponsor, I would helm an expedition of my own into the depths of Tibia.",

        "text": "The principle of opening a gate for a demonic army is the same as summoning a demon. You need to accumulate some critical mass of synergistic energy and open a rift between the worlds. The needed ingredients consist of some of the negative energy that is similar to the essence of the demonic realm.\nThe first part of the summoning ritual opens only a small rift to the demonic realm. Through this rift demonic energy enters into our world infiltrating into the ingredients and filling them with more power. With stronger ingredients, the ritual opens a larger rift this time, letting more demonic energy in to strengthen the ingredients. This ritual is repeated over and over again until the ingredients are strong enough to open a portal through which the demons can pass.\nThis ritual can also be initiated from the demon side. Sightings of Orshabaal and similar entities clearly show all characteristics common for such rituals.\nOnce the gate is open, demonic minions appear and boost the negative energy of the place by their sheer presence. Later, the demonic master is following. His appearance causes a drop of the negative energy as the demon lord is feeding on it to sustain his existence in our realm.\nAs long as there are enough minions to boost the negative energy of a place, demons can exist for a very long time in our realm. So in theory, it would also be possible that the gate between the two realms is kept open, allowing more and more demons to enter our world that can easily form a demonic army causing mayhem and havoc.",

        "text": "The Complete and Unabridged Story of the Three Wizards\nThe Wizards were friends once. They still are, in a way... however, they are always arguing, complaining about each other and trying to outsmart each other whenever possible. Each of them basically has the exact same qualifications, goals and methods, but in completely different areas.\nBefore this time of unending quarrel, they were all working together on a complex experiment. Its goal was to create an ever-burning source of energy, fluid magic concentrated in a gigantic vessel. Ultimate, pure and self-replenishing power. They combined their talents and unique features, working together as a whole. Fern of Nature drew unfathomable amounts of energy from the life roots of the world, channelling all forms of energy created by living, moving things and even nature itself to Furb. Furb of Fun created a magic device, capable of conducting this stream of force to Feiz. Feiz was bending the planes of time and the laws of the whole physical realm of Tibia to form and sustain the vessel. The combined might of three highly trained and completely focussed wizards, who spent almost all their life concentrating on this single purpose, was necessary to keep this power at bay.\nThere were days of doubt, however. Days of recreation, days of training and focus. Days when they were weak and felt broken, even destroyed. It was on one of those days when they were first contacted by Carlotta. The wizards did not cherish many contacts to the world of men. Living high above in a small realm of their own magic, host to the clouds and secluded from even the eyes of dragons, they did not exactly get out much. When they learned about a fellow sorceress by the name of Carlotta, who somehow found out about what they were doing and who wanted to take part, they were actually enraged, even angry. As they saw no harm in what they were doing, however, they did not see any threat to their work in a person who suddenly took their plans seriously. Still, they were reluctant and turned her help down.\nThat was when Fern received a more... personal letter from Carlotta. The author of this story does not know the content of these writings, the consequences, however, are crucial to this tale. The problem was, Furb did not receive such a letter - neither did Feiz. When a second, a third and several more letters arrived, Fern had already stopped opening them in front of the others. And he wrote back. Their focus weakened.\nAs the weeks passed by, the results of their efforts were more often than not unsatisfactory. Around this time, the letters to Fern stopped. Fern never said a thing to the others. The project went on.\nEverything went smoothly until Furb received a present. From Carlotta. Fern had never received anything else than written words. He would have even understood Carlotta turning to Furb for one reason or another, but a complete set of unique Zaoan jade figures changed everything. Fern loved Zaoan chess. He was heartbroken when he saw Furb playing with what was rightfully his. And Furb was writing letters now. Their focus weakened again. Furb and Fern were literally competing about even the smallest component of their everyday life. Finding out who was actually worthy of the sorceress changed their ways fundamentally.\nWhen the project reached a critical state, Feiz cut the connection to the outside world completely. Isolated and in complete dismay, they continued.\nThey did not hear of Carlotta again. The experiment failed. Feiz' remarks about losing grip because of petty differences over the teasings of a woman made all three of them rivals. They now spend their time creating tests, riddles and even competitions to let the outside world decide what they, in all their equality, cannot.\nWhat happened to Carlotta? Will the three ever declare a winner? And who is that distant relative Feiz suddenly has to visit from time to time?",

        "text": "The Origin of Vampires\nSince the vampiric curse is spread through infectious bites, many vampires know only little about the origin of their kind. Then again the longevity or even immortality of vampires makes it possible that they have even existed before the creation of mankind.\nOf course such beasts are hard to capture and they do not like to share their knowledge. Even if you are lucky enough to be able to talk to one, you cannot be sure if he is telling the truth. In fact, most questioned subjects were making up stories and boasted about their importance, age and accomplishments.\nLacking historical knowledge, such individuals can usually be cornered by accurate historical questions. This leaves a few sources that can be seen as credible to some extent. Still, their reports are diverse and share only a few facts. These common facts are the most reliable information we have these days.\nThe vampires claim that the eldest of their kin still remember a time when humankind was still divided in nomadic tribes that suffered in the wars of the gods. Some see this as a reference that the creation of the first vampires took place before the Corpse War.\nThe majority of vampires agreed that there was only one shrouded forefather vampire, though few mention also a small coven from which the vampire plague was initiated. The most reliable sources tell about some 'lost kingdom' where the first vampires ruled over a herd of humans that they treated like cattle.\nAt some point in history, the younger vampires rebelled against the elders who suppressed them. Others claim the rebellion took place to gain power in this static aristocracy in which the older vampires would have never made room for the next generation due to being near to immortal. It is unknown which side won. In fact the discrepancies in the single stories are so large that we assume that the vampires themselves are unsure about the happenings in these obviously chaotic days. Some claim the rebels won and chased the aristocracy away, others say the ruling cast won and met the rebels with such brute force that the few survivors could only flee. Then again there are stories that the fight between the vampires awakened something evil which drove the surviving combatants off their once safe haven. A few stories even claim that the humans used this opportunity to rebel against their cruel oppressors.\nThere are no hints about the location of this lost vampire kingdom. It is assumed that it was somewhere overseas, though. Some historians suggest Edron, but, the ruins in Edron are said to origin from much earlier times. Others assume it might have been on the mysterious continent Darama, either in Drefia or in Ankrahmun. However, the destruction of Drefia took place much later and there were no reports about undead activity, except for the works of several local necromancers, before this time. Ankrahmun, on the other hand, has a very accurate historical library and there is no such thing like a vampire kingdom mentioned at all.",

They must not collide with the ship. Each collision will add one destruction point to the ship. If a certain amount of destruction points has been reached, the mission fails.\nAdditionally, the spectral core of the ship is located on the upper deck. Due to the strains of your journey, it will take damage at random times. If it is 'killed', the ship will take a significant amount of destruction points which will almost certainly lead to a failure of the voyage.\nOn the middle deck, the spiritual movement and energy source are located. The ship gains energy by discharging elemental forces that have to be brought to the corresponding elemental shrines. When someone approaches the purple flame, he will be charged with a certain elemental energy and change his appearance accordingly, though only for a limited time. This person has to reach the corresponding shrine and use it to discharge his energy. This will revitalise the purple flame. If the purple flame ever goes out, the ship will take considerable damage. Avoid the spectral vortexes and the grates. They will discharge you of elemental energy or confuse you temporarily. The flames will hurt you but neither stop nor discharge you. Sometimes sloth wraiths will spawn that can slow you down considerably. They are invulnerable but will disappear when lured on a spectral vortex.\nOn the lowest deck of the ship, you will find an emergency kit and a ghost duster. Both items are ESSENTIAL for your task. The appointed people should take them as quickly as possible.\nOn the lowest deck, ghost rats will spawn constantly. Use your ghost duster to destroy the rats. The rats' gnawing will occasionally destroy parts of the floor. The floor is destroyed in several stages. As long as no water is leaking, someone with an emergency kit can fix the holes,  though the rats are able to gnaw through the fixed spot again. Each floor tile through which water is leaking will add destruction points to the ship. It is advised that one person uses the ghost duster and another the emergency kit, although groups may decide that they might need some more help on one of the other decks.\nThe journey will end with a failure once the ship has reached a certain amount of destruction points, or with success if the limit of destruction points has not been reached after a given period of time.",

        "text": "Chronicles of the Realm XXI\nIn the third year of the reign of prince-king Rodmund II it was exposed that the priests of Zathroth planned a coup to assassinate the young king and usurp the kingship. Hastily but in secrecy the first Inquisition was formed under the helmsmanship of grand priest Wisbert from the temple of Uman who was chief advisor of the uncrowned, 15 year old Rodmund. The traitorous elements were exposed and routed out. In the whole land Zathroth's temples were seized and the conspiring priesthood put in jail. Interrogations by the Inquisition unearthed the massive extent of the treachery and the church of Zathroth fell in irredeemable disgrace with the crown. Within a year under the guidance of Wisbert, the Purger, the worship of Zathroth was forbidden in the whole realm and their temples where destroyed or cleansed and reclaimed by the churches of the other gods. The grand priest of Zathroth, Madol, the Defiler, was burned at the stake, north of Thais. Even after his coronation in the year after the purge had begun, king Rodmund II had to live reclusive and under the vigilance of the Inquisition and the church of Banor since several attempts on his live were made by remaining Zathroth cultists. To honor his efforts and wisdom, Wisbert was named chancelor of the realm. In his tireless efforts he spearheaded the purge and managed to rout out several traitorous nobles that were in league with the Zathrothi. In his renewal and healing of the realm, a significant amount of lesser but pious houses were elevated to positions of honor and influence and the realm prospered by their wise, divine inspired guidance in the years to come.",

In some cases this is clear, if I punch a ball I am the cause of the movement, but whatabout an object falling?\nFalling objects head downwards, but what is \"down\", what is below us? The answer is simple: Hell! And who rules hell? Satan! So, obviously Satan is the cause of these movements, Satan is among us all the time. But if he causes these objects to fall, what reason is there that he should not be the cause of all other movements?",

I indeed believe there was once a powerful lone dragon who was the first of all. He wandered our world thousands of years ago and then disappeared. Was it Garsharak himself? Or was it his first child? Has this ancient creature really left this world or is it still there, hiding somewhere, perhaps sleeping, perhaps waiting? These questions preyed on my mind for many a year. Finally, when I joined the Explorer Society, I decided to do my own research. I visited many libraries all over Tibia and studied many books. I travelled to remote and dangerous places to do excavations. But I never found the smallest hint that the First Dragon ever existed. I was ready to give up, I just wanted to visit just one last site. And incredibly, I discovered something! An ancient inscription, nearly invisible, buried in the walls of this small cave underneath Thais. I uncovered it and began to translate the old runes which had been used centuries ago. Only single fragments are still readable:\n\"... First Dragon ... thousands ... ago. ... four descendants ... different kinds of dragons. ... Gelidrazah, Taz... disappeared. ... cemetery? Or ... Yal...? ... trials ... incitements in order to find the lairs of ...\"\nIt is very hard to translate the heavily weathered inscription. I feel I should hurry because more and more frequently I'm hearing scratching steps and a roaring from afar. There could be a dragon living down here and that would be my perdition for sure.",

They will fight with us and guard the key to the secret laboratory.\nKing Markwin protected the entrance to the lab with a dragon, but my druid could convince it. So we can use the lab to increase our power.\nWe were digging a new tunnel to the city. Markwin locked the hidden entrance with a rock.\nYeah! The tunnel is finished and we were able to attack king Markwin within his own walls. They weren`t prepared at all and we killed many of those creepy bastards.\nSoon we will be strong enough to convince the other dragon and reach the surface.\nToday I send a group of diggers to make a new way up to the light of the sun. They really have a hard job to do, but I think they will do it.\nI haven`t heard anything of my diggers since a whole month. I hope this is no bad sign.",

        "text": "The riddle\nOnce upon a time, there have been a knight, a druid, a paladin and a sorcerer that survived the great battle upon the fields of glory. Some of them were wounded, some not. All were deadly tired. They had to escape from a hord of orcs, a whole tribe with more then 35 fighters. Late in the night, they came to a huge bridge, or at least the rest of a once mighty bridge. It was small and seemed to be not very save. The sorcerer screamed some loud and mighty words and for a second the bridge glew in a blue light.\n\"I see\" the sorcerer said, \"that this bridge will break down and fall into the water within 60 minutes. So we have to hurry up. It will only hold two of us at the same time and it is a long bridge. The wounded knight will need 25 minutes to go over the bridge, and it will take me 20. The paladin can go faster, so he will be on the other side within 10 minutes.\"\nPointing at the druid he said: \"And you can use your spell to move faster. You will need only 5 minutes.\"\n\"Ok then, let`s go! Don`t waste time\" shouted the knight and started to go. But then he stopped. \"I can`t see anything. The bridge is dangerous. We will need your magic light wand to cross it. Without light we will fall down in the cold and deep water. So always someone has to return to bring back the wand of light to the others.\"\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked the paladin \"How can we all reach the other side before the evil orcs will get us? I have no arrow left and we can`t fight them! In which order we have to pass the bridge? Who should go first?\" The druid started to grumbel: \"Let me say k for knight, d for druid, s for sorcerer, p for paladin. hmmm.... and now let me thing:\ndk-d-dp-\nand hmmmm nonono.\nHmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\"\n\"Got it!\" the sorcerer screamed. \"Let`s run!\"",

The young Roland fell to death while trying to steal the flag from the Thaian castle. Not only that we lost the time and effort we put into his education, the whole affair did draw some unwanted attention on our organisation. It is quite certain that the young fool used some of our highly specialised equipment in his silly stunt. As far as we know the whole affair is still under observation by the local authorities. We have to find a way to draw their attention in another direction before too many questions are asked. I had two of the senior students eliminated to make an example for the future. Such occurrences must stop once for all but I fear the harm has been already done and is irrevocable.",

However, they must be severely controlled by a handful of specialists with some skill in 'convincing'. I am aware of the smugglers' usefulness and their role in our plans, but their unreliability is a constant threat to us. Of course they have no idea what we are doing here but they are curious and would sell their own grandmother for a mug of ale. Perhaps we could simply replace them with more trustworthy followers. Not all are that suitable as asassins or agitators but all of them are able to follow orders and how difficult can it be to do some smuggling.

Although efficiently done, there was no finesse or skill displayed in their elimination. The fallen paladin Ned Noxious simply provoked the said individuals in a tavern. As soon as one of them was stupid enough to draw a weapon, they were disposed by a combination of energy bombs and fireballs. Of course the authorities did little about it since the tavern's patrons did swear the others attacked first.

The first reports about his activities date back to the pirate conflict that threatened the Venore merchants council. Noxious obviously was hired along with other mercenaries to get rid of some pirate captains that held the usually unorganised pirates under their control. Altough there are no specifics about the affair, Ned Noxious was the only one, out of of the twelve hired mercenaries, that returned to claim his reward. Afterwards he was employed by different persons or groups for undocumented and rather insignificant jobs. His next notable apperance was the elimination of the bandit queen Leerah within her own camp full of renegade amazons. It is assumed that Noxious used invisibility to get to her and quickly killed her before any guards could react.\nFurther accomplishments that are probably related to him:\nThe assassination of the last Thaian mayor of Venore.\nThe assassination of the mage Haramun in Darashia.\nThe assassination of the Mixton Family.\nThe sabotage of the 'Queen Torviva' in the harbor of Carlin.\nThe poisoning of the Edron wells which led to five deaths.\nThe killing of at least six noblemen in provoked duels.\nWe cannot be sure for which felonies he was paid by an unknown party and which of these acts he fulfilled out of sheer morbid pleasure. Still the lack of any proof makes it impossible to punish him adequately.\nAt least three assassination attempts on him have already failed.",

Noxious is efficient yet expensive, but if it comes to really important missions, money matters little. Still, it is a sad thing to see that a freelancer outclasses the specialists who we invested a great deal of money in to train. Take Ned Noxious not as an obstacle but as a touchstone.",

The bodies of the sorcerers and druids are not trained enough to stand his lessons as long as they should to improve adequately. On the other hand, the knights and the paladins adopt to the ways of magic too slowly to see any progress above a certain given point. So we will stick to the concept of the four ways and drop the idea of the warrior-mages for now. Perhaps in the future we might find another way to combine the skills of arms and magic in some way.",

When Hugo followed the 'track' we laid for him, our druids trapped him with plant barriers and then moved earth around him. Now the beast is trapped. May Fardos, Uman and Banor give that we can keep him satiated and calm by using the trick the druids figured out. Our aspirants will have a hard time to pass the test that was created around this beast.",

Usually they are referred to as greedy imbuers which suggests that the other races harboured no love for them. Yet, their skills in charging items with magical energy must have been of some value to the others. It seems they prospered for a while, selling their craft. At some point though, the other races decided to take what they needed by force and thereby destroyed the entire race. Some texts hint that the Shapers preferred to sacrifice themselves and to detonate their forges, rather than letting them fall into the hands of others. Other forges were destroyed when trying to lift their secrets. Again others were dismantled by Shapers in order to protect them from the wrong hands. Some were simply stolen, only to learn that all but the simplest of them had stopped working. As for the Astral Shapers, they were used by their captors as some kind of magical truffle pig for a while. However, since their spirit was broken, the race as such perished and eventually died out.",

Thus you create a magic wand able to curse a soul. With the energy of a hereby tainted soul you are able to create mighty artifacts and powerful spells.\nA tainted soul may only be redeemed with a sacred talisman.

When the void came to a rest and the first dreamwalkers returned to the dreamlands, the fortresses were gone - all of them and with them all the ancients who manned them. The Shaig'laar lost their best men in these days and never recovered from the loss. So weak, they became an easy prey for the other ancients and so the period of the first dream masters had come to an end.\nFrom this time on, all dreamwalkers manipulate the dreamland as little as possible, only as much as it is needed to fit their needs.

We might fear it, but it cannot scare us. We might be weaker, but in the end evil will lose. Evil is hollow and self-consuming. Nothing can warm up the cold hearts of evil beings, nothing can fill the loneliness. A life so centred on itself cannot be shared with others. If you do not share your life, you deny it. Life is sharing. No one can cope with life alone. You have to share your life to give birth. You have to share to feel your life. Evil beings do not feel life, so they destroy it. Evil cannot understand life, and things that cannot be understood are feared.",

To train this, get accustomed to asking yourself : 'Am I awake?' Do this at daytime as often as possible. But be careful! Do not conclude too quickly that you are awake. Try to 'fly' just on your thoughts, try to change the world around you by sheer imagination. Take some time to test reality.\nAt some point of that training you will use this routine in your sleep as well. Then it is essential to come to the conclusion that you are asleep! If you have accomplished that, you will have a hard time to balance between dreaming and awakening. At first you will often slip back in the dream state but that will change quickly. Then you can begin the art of dreamwalking.",

You will get used to understand them just by reading and reliving them. It's not necessary to force something. This could even be harmful! Understand them as a nice story someone told you.

She was so pretty that seven elven men travelled to the settlement to see her beauty. But the girl feared that the elves just wanted to steal her underwear to dance around in it in the morning mists. So she asked her friend, a big wolf, to help her. The wolf put on boots and a red cape and ate some chalk to smooth his voice. Impersonating little Coalblack, he lured the elves into the darkest woods. But the elves dropped their clothes in the woods to be able to trace back the way they had taken. In the middle of the forest the elves found a magic mirror. They asked the mirror: 'Mirror, mirror in the forest, tell us whom you most adorest' And the mirror spoke 'You naked elves are pathetic!' The elves turned around and were deeply offended. 'What a bunch of incredible bums!' the mirror said. The stupid elves misunderstood the mirror and felt so flattered and cajoled that they built a gingerbread house around it and lived there happily ever after.",

They are training them to serve them as war wolves when grown up. Unfortunately one of them escaped and ran into the woods. I didn't go after it, I didn't want to risk losing the others, too. One day later I could spot a female wolf who had adopted the lost puppy. I recognised it by its unusual fur pattern. I didn't chase it because I was short of supplies and thus on my way to Edron. I would have missed my ship. The second whelp died shortly after. Given its weakly condition I assume the orcs wouldn't have paid for it anyway. I skinned it and sold the fur in Venore to a trader who was interested in fabrics and pelts. I can't remember her name but she was quite a poppet. Now I'm on my way to Ulderek's Rock and hopefully will make a mint of money by selling the third puppy to the orcs.",

        "text": "The Ghostsilver Lantern - Scientific Research into Arcane Artefacts\nSome months ago I found a clue leading to an ancient artefact in one of the oldest tomes in this library: the Ghostsilver Lantern. Many centuries ago some of these magical artefacts were created by a powerful mage. They are made from magically treated silver and glass coated with ghostly ectoplasm. Nowadays unknown runes are engraved into the silver braces of the lantern. Thus the artefact is able to reveal hidden doors when lit. It even uncovers entrances that would otherwise be completely invisible to the naked eye. As the mage sadly didn't (or couldn't) pass his knowledge on to posterity, we can't create Ghostsilver Lanterns without further ado today. Yet I'm convinced that at least one of these lanterns still exists in the old masonry my circle has chosen for its current homestead. In the course of my explorations ofl the rooms and hallways, I discovered a separate chamber, only reachable by a stairway on the lowest floor. High in a corner there was a thick spider web and something was glittering in the sticky strands. I could catch a glimpse of a silvery and blue object that could very well have been one of the said lanterns. I couldn't reach it (not that I was afraid of the big spider guarding the web) so I had to leave empty-handed. Later on I could not return because this time the lowest floor was flooded with the creepy shapers that suddenly showed up here. I hope we'll drive them back soon so that I'll have a chance to obtain the precious artefact. With a treasure like this I could probably gain the favour of the Circle Master Uquora herself. (And I hope that before we defeat them the shapers will have made short work of the huge spider that was between me and the lantern. ... Of course it was the lack of a ladder that hindered me from taking it, as I already noted.)\nZegrath, Novice of the Circle of the Black Sphinx",

        "text": "History of the Augur, Part I\nWe, the families of the Augur, have been living here for many generations. In the course of time, we acquired certain insights in the ways of our masters, the Yalahari. Many years ago, things used to be very different in this city. Once it was a marvel to behold, but then it started to decay slowly and steadily. This process of deterioration begun in the far past, long before our ancestors came[ here. At the time they were brought here by the Yalahari as helpers and workers, the city already showed signs of decline. Despite their claim of having great power, the Yalahari could do little to stop the catastrophes that should occur. Neither did they do anything to restore the damaged parts of the city. Still, it took many centuries until the city had reached the pitiful state that you can witness today.\nSome decades ago, a group of Augur suspected that we all were lied to by our masters. They started to look for clues that proved their assumptions, and secretly gathered parts of the puzzle one by one. For all we know, there had been indeed a powerful race called the Yalahari that built this city to distance itself from the wars of some capricious gods. So far the tales that our masters had told us, have been true. These Yalahari were served by a group of Augur such as us. They were their helpers and workers, and the Yalahari shared some of their luxuries and achievements with them. The Yalahari concentrated on research and art, and left the more manual work to their servants, who often only knew what they had to do without understanding their tasks. At one far-away point in history, the Yalahari seemingly vanished. Certain clues that our ancestors gathered, hint that they locked themselves in the city's centre and cut off all contact to their helpers. When the Augur sometime later dared to enter the inner city, the Yalahari were all gone - vanished without a trace. After getting over the initial shock, the Augur assumed the role of the Yalahari themselves. For a while they tried to get familiar with some of the secrets of their lost masters, but they were only able to understand the most basic concepts of the Yalahari's knowledge. They stuck to their usual tasks to keep the city running. Still, they were too few to keep the enormous city, of which they understood so little, in shape.\nSo they decided to recruit Augur on their own. This way most of our forefathers came to Yalahar. In the meanwhile, the former Augur retreated into the inner city.",

        "text": "History of the Augur, Part II\nThey brought more and more people to Yalahar. Not all of them became Augur, a good part of them lived in Yalahar as ordinary citizens. At some point, the city had reached a much larger population than under the rule of the true Yalahari, and it became difficult to provide food and shelter for everyone. Time and overuse took it's toll on the city. Over the years, more and more parts of the city were lost due to ignorance, lack of resources, or catastrophes. The new Yalahari were unable to restore broken machines and devices, and their efforts to retake certain parts of the city with the help of the Augur caused only more disaster. So the new Yalahari decided to stay in the city's centre, letting the Augur care for the rest of the city as well as they could. Still, their image as Yalahari allowed them to claim supremacy and to rule over the whole city. This all did not matter too much to our ancestors. The new Yalahari were neither cruel nor overly abusive, and they still wielded the powerful weapons and armors of the true Yalahari. So they stuck to the status quo and continued to work for the Yalahari despite everything they had found out. This worked quite well although the city was still declining and great parts of it had been lost to chaos and anarchy.\nLately, though, things started to change. It is not a dramatic change but it can be recognised gradually at many places. Some of the known routines in the orders of the Yalahari have altered. There are more and more orders who have a dubious purpose. The most frightening thing is that some orders obviously hint at a person with Yalahari knowledge that had been considered as lost for centuries. The overwhelming majority of the new Yalahari still clings to their ignorant and self-centred ways, but perhaps one of them or a small group has discovered some hidden secrets of their vanished masters. It is also possible that something completely different is happening, we simply don't know. But these new orders that seem to aim at restoring order in the city have some bitter taste. They are somewhat oppressive and destructive, not in an obvious way, though. Taken together, they paint a dark picture of Yalahar's future. A future of oppression, betrayal, and a much stricter rule by the Yalahari.",

We concentrated on our research and spiritual evolution and have turned a blind eye on the needs of the people that are our subjects.

The experiment to give people too much freedom and too little guidance has to be stopped before all is lost. We have a responsibility for this city and the people living here. Only with our help, they will be able to flourish and to overcome the shadows of the past. The city can be rebuilt and restored to at least some of its former glory when we diligently work for it. It will be hard and it will take the help of determined individuals to assist us in our efforts. However, in the long run, order will be completely re-established and Yalahar will once again be the magnificent city it used to be.\nOnly with drastic decisions and changes, this great goal can be achieved. We will have to get through hard times and prepare for them as good as we can. Most importantly, a good city needs a solid base. For this reason we have to start at the bottom to clean things up. We have to be precise and consequent in our decisions and actions. This way we will be able to create a solid base for the city.\nTo some extent, we have to work like a gardener. The rotten parts have to be cut off, and the healthy parts have to be cherished. The city has to be retaken. Then order can be restored and the actual rebuilding can begin.

        "text": "Tunnelling guide\n----------------\nby Gromward Hammerfist\n'The art of building a tunnel lies in the nature of dwarfes.' That's what my grand grand grandfather used to say. First of all I'd like to give you a small historical review of tunnelling. .....<you skip the first 1000 pages containing dwarfen tunnelling history>.\nRepairing collapsed tunnels:\nEquipment: Pick, tree or bricklayers kit\nBefore picking away the rubble you need to place a buttress otherwise the tunnel will collapse over and over again. If you don't have a matching tree at hand you could still build a brickwall to stabilize the tunnel. Good luck!\nRepairing gaps:\nEquipment: Wood, wooden ties,  hammer, nails, metal fitting\nFor each missing part (on the basis of a standard rail) I recommend to use three pieces of wood. Lock them in position by at least 6 nails. For the rail itself use a saw on a piece of wood to build your wooden ties. Then place two metal fittings on them and you can make your first ride on your new rail. Congratulations!\nBuilding a rail on lava:\nI advice not to try that until you have at least 20 years experience in rail construction......<Well, seems like you don't match the premises.>\nAdventuring old tunnels:\nBe aware that our kind mastered the art of tunnelling. It may take you a whole life to understand the techniques that are used and it takes generations to know all the tunnels of a mine and all their exits. You even may find an exit that you never expected to.\nTo sum up\nIf you are no dwarf don't even try to think that you have a chance of mastering the art of tunnelling. If you are a dwarf I wish you good luck and don't abandon faith. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.\nYours\nGromward Hammerfist",

        "text": "II. 28th\nToday my brothers and I are leaving from Carlin to find a new place for us and our families. None of the great Tibian cities have made us feel at home yet. There must be something else, and we will find it.\nIII. 5th\nWe've been at sea for a few days now. Time seems endless, and so does the ocean. We have supplies for 3 more weeks. Should we not find land within the next week we will cancel our expedition to make sure we get back home safely.\nIII. 8th\nStill nothing... but the screams of seagulls and the sound of the waves... we are still hoping.\nIII. 10th\nWe've spotted land! It's still a day away, but it seems to be a really large island. Not only that,  we can also make out tall towers in the distance. Strangely though, this city - or whatever it is - can't be found on our map, despite its obvious size.\nIII. 11th\nWe've arrived at the harbour of Yalahar, as the inhabitants call it. Obviously large parts of the city are destroyed and closed for the public. We will stay in a tavern tonight - finally, a bed again! - and then try to find a place to live in.\nIII. 14th\nFinding a house seems to be harder than expected. The inner city of Yalahar which seems safe and rather wealthy has almost no place left, especially not for outsiders as us. Maybe we can live in one of the outer quarters, close to the city walls at least.\nIII. 18th\nLersatio found an unoccupied house not too far away from the centre. It is close to an alchemical lab. Maybe we can even find some work there. Things are looking great!\nIII. 20th\nWe've settled down and started the repair work on the house. This may take a while, but we are sending note to our families to come after us. Arthei's wife Kala insisted to come with us right from the start, so they are already together, but I am starting to miss my girl immensely. Oh sweet Melava, I hope you are well.\nIII. 21th\nThis place is not as good as it seemed. The closeness to the alchemical laboratories proves to be a constant menace and now I understand why they didn't want it in the centre. Frequent explosions are startling us during the whole day, and even at nighttime there is a lot of noise from the facilities. Due to these circumstances we will probably try to find another place, luckily we haven't put too much work into the house, yet. Also, our families won't come, yet.\nIII. 30th\nOh god... something horrible happened and I've not been able to write for a while... a week ago there was a HUGE explosion in the night... fire spread upon almost all houses nearby... we barely escaped the flames... my hands are burnt, because I pulled my brother out of the burning house and we all are still coughing grey substance... Boreth and Lersation got out with some scratches and burns, but otherwise we three are fine. It's just Arthei... he got burnt really badly... I barely recognise his face... Kala is sitting at his bed 24 hours a day with red swollen eyes and praying for his life. When she falls asleep in exhaustion we are keeping watch.\n<from here on, all of the pages have been torn out, only the last page remains:>\nTHE FIRST DAY OF ETERNITY\nI CAN SEE NOW. FOOLS. ALL OF YOU. HAHAHAHAHA.",

At first we were all so happy about the miracle of Arthei's recovery that we didn't care about anything else, but now, some... side effects have appeared. Arthei has never looked as pale as now and he hardly speaks a single word. At least he still knows that we are his brothers, but he doesn't seem to recognise Kala, his wife. This is incredibly hard for her because she was really doing anything in her might to help him get better. And now that he is well again, he is very distant. He calls her 'that woman' and doesn't let her into his room. God, this is so bad. We are hoping that this is only a mood swing or some sort of amnesia that will pass over time...\nIV. 12th\nKala is gone!! Oh, what horrible times are those. In her sadness, and confronted with Arthei's constant rejection, she must have left the house last night. She left almost all of her belongings. We are so worried about her... and hope so badly that she didn't decide to throw her life away as desperate as she has been. Arthei didn't even notice... and when we told him, he just shrugged his shoulders. She doesn't deserve this... she is such a sweet and caring woman. We have been looking all over the city for her - in the accessible parts that is - but couldn't find her. I will look for her later again.\nIV. 13th\nKala remains missing... and Arthei seems to sneak out at night too, although he is always back in the mornings. I only noticed because I was getting up from my bed to fetch a mug of water, when I saw him closing the front door. What is he doing outside at this time? And, come to think about it, he has never left the house or even his room during daytime ever since he recovered. What has happened to him?",

However this has changed during the last week. People are getting suspicious of Arthei - some saw him after the explosion and know that his sudden recovery can't have happened in a natural way. And they are starting to talk... what makes matters worse is that some murders have occurred since Arthei's recovery. I don't know any details or what exactly was the cause for their death, but I can't stop thinking that Arthei might have something to do with it. His nightly excursions... the state he is in... and it seems that I'm not the only one who thinks that way. As I said... people are starting to talk...\nIV. 22th\nI don't know how long we can stay here. People whisper with each other and stare hatefully at Lersatio, Boreth and me when we cross the street. I really want to protect my brother, but I'm very scared.\nIV. 25th\nOn the ocean again... this night, we were almost killed by a mob who banged at our door with the obvious intention to remove what they consider a threat to their lives. Well... I can't blame them... we pulled struggling Arthei out of the house and with us, and now we're out at sea on the small boat we arrived in.

We also haven't seen Arthei for a few days.\nIV. 20th\nThis must be... a curse?

I fell asleep during the night watch at my brother's bed, must have been only for a few minutes, but when I opened my eyes, I saw a black... being... hovering over Arthei's bed, getting closer and closer to him. I wanted to jump to my feet and scream, but I was unable to move. All I could do was dig my nails into my own flesh. Then suddenly, the being looked directly into my eyes. I remember thinking 'how strange', because the creature had no face and thus no eyes, yet I knew that it was looking at me. Then I couldn't bear the cold of its look anymore and passed out. I don't know what happened afterwards. All that matters now is that Arthei has recovered. And with recovered I mean that there is not a SCRATCH on him anymore. He is completely well, I'm not able to explain why, but I don't care. Kala is crying for joy, I think the black being wasn't evil, but a god.",

But they did not leave the humans without guidance. There was Daraman, the gods' chosen prophet, who carefully prepared them for the spiritual and ethical challenges that awaited them in a world full of treachery and evil. And there was Banor, the very first human, a champion of superhuman might and life span, who taught his people how to fight on the battlefield. On his advice the pharaoh of Ankrahmun built a strong army, and it was Banor who designed the plans for Ankrahmun's famous fortifications. And soon enough the new human armies proved themselves in fierce battles against their undead and orcish enemies. Their kind paid heavy prices in these costly battles, but they learnt to accept sacrifices, and it soon become apparent that the human race was here to stay. Eventually only the fearsome djinns posed a real threat to the human race. They defeated the humans in several important battles using their fearsome magic and their skill with the scimitar. However, just when the situation appeared to be most dire Daraman, the revered human prophet, entered the scene and helped to neutralise the djinn threat in a way nobody had foreseen.",

It has been insinuated that he acted purposefully to sow the seeds of disunity among the djinn race, but considering his personal integrity this seems unlikely. Whatever his motives, though, Daraman's teachings caused a bitter controversy among the djinns, and eventually a fierce civil war broke out. This did a lot to ease the situation for the humans, but Banor was clear-sighted enough to know that his race would sooner or later get involved into the conflict. It was not hard to work out for him which side to support. Under the influence of Daraman's teachings Gabel, his former enemy, openly propagated peaceful coexistence between humans and djinns. Banor accepted this offer in the name of all humans and formed an alliance with the Marid. It was only logical then that the Alliance fought side by side in the battle of Ankrahmun against the Efreet who had secretly allied with the Drefian necromancers. The victory of the Alliance was overwhelming, but it came with a heavy price. A cataclysmic firestorm unleashed by the Efreet set the whole Kha'labal ablaze, forever turning what used to be a paradise into a barren wasteland. Countless human lives were lost in the magic inferno, and the survivors found that their homes had been destroyed. Faced with a choice of slowly starving to death or leaving their native land forever, a large group of survivors followed Banor on his quest for a new home. Their exodus triggered a chain of events that eventually resulted in the cataclysmic wars of the unliving, but it was also the fateful moment when the humans' slow, but steady conquest of the whole of Tibia started. But that is a different story.",

Working with superhuman resolve and ruthlessly exterminating all real or imaginary competition, Gha'Zuul managed to rise to the top of the Drefian hierarchy within a few decades, and when a bizarre accident happened to the president of the High Council, Gha'Zuul took his place. He was the first necromancer to take this position while still being alive. However, being the foremost necromancer was still not enough to satisfy Gha'Zuul's thirst for power. He had great plans for Drefia. Under his rule the necromancer city would expand and conquer, taking over control of the north and perhaps of the whole of Darama! It was his idea to propose an alliance to the Efreet, and when the decisive battle drew near he personally raised the necromancers' troops to march against the Marid.\nThe rest is well-known. Drefia's troops suffered a decisive defeat in the battle of Ankrahmun. Those undead who were not destroyed during the futile siege of Ankrahmun were pulverised in the searing heat his own allies had summoned. Gha'Zuul realised soon enough that his career in Drefia was rapidly drawing to an end, for if the Marid did not kill him his fellow necromancers surely would. And so he disappeared...\nToday, there are nothing but rumours as to what happened to Gha'Zuul after the failed campaign. However, many believe that Gha'Zuul is still out there, waiting for an opportunity to take revenge just like he used to do when he was still a little nomad boy.",

She grew up in the pharaoh's palace, living a seemingly careless life amidst the proverbial luxury and splendour of the Ankrahmunian court, and when her father arranged for her to marry a well-proven northern nobleman her happiness seemed complete. But things were not quite the way they seemed. Theripat, who was a headstrong and idealistic girl, had always despised life at the court, and with the help of her nurse she had made many forays into the city, concealing her true identity. On one of these excursions she had fallen in love with a handsome officer from the pharaoh's guard. The young man requited the love of what he thought was a simple woman, and eventually the two lovers had even married. When the pharaoh finally decided it was time for his daughter to marry she was already 6 months pregnant, and she knew that soon the truth could no longer be hidden. Frightened and confused, Theripat went through the wedding preparations without saying a word, but when the day had finally come she fled the court. The whole extent of the scandal soon became obvious.",

        "text": "Legends of the Kha'labal III - Gha'Zuul the Necromancer\nGha'Zuul grew up a simple boy among one of the northern nomad tribes. A frail and meagre child, he was frequently the target of the other childrens' jeers as well as of his despotic father's scorn. Hurt and angered by the constant humiliations, Gha'Zuul developed a bitter, unforgiving personality. He took notes of all the indignities he suffered, and he was determined to take revenge for every single one of them. One day, when his camp was attacked by an undead raiding party he decided it was time to get his revenge. Taking advantage of the general hullabaloo, Gha'Zuul sneaked up on his worst tormentor and quickly cut his throat. However, he had made a mistake when he thought that his crime would go unnoticed. One of the necromancers who was part of the raiding party sensed the evil of this deed, and since he was impressed by the young boy's obvious ruthlessness he ordered his undead troops to kidnap him. And so Gha'Zuul was brought to Drefia.",

Both Theripat's nurse and her true husband were arrested and publicly drawn and quartered. Theripat herself had escaped into the desert with her new-born child, but her unforgiving father sent half his army after her. She was found soon enough, but just when the troops were about to arrest her, the unexpected happened. Clinging her baby to her breast, the desperate mother fell into a piercing, bloodcurling wail that quickly expanded into an unearthly sound to which nature itself seemed to respond. All of a sudden a sandstorm erupted, fiercer and stronger than anybody could remember, and within minutes destruction rained down upon the pharaoh's terrified troops. When the storm cleared the soldiers were severely shaken, and many of the pharaoh's best chariots lay shattered in the sand. Theripat and her child, however, were gone forever, and nobody has seen them ever since. But each time the storm rages over the Kha'labal the superstitious people fall into a silent prayer to appease the wailing bride's fury.",

The shadows which in those days held the rest of the world in their cold grip became aware of the humans and of their riches, and soon enough they began to plot the young race's destruction. Ferocious orcs built fleets and started raiding the south-western coastline, while the north was threatened by eerie undead who began to spread their insidious poison among the terrified humans. Worse, the corruption slowly found its way into many of the humans's hearts, and strife and armed conflict erupted within the community. Some humans even fell for the morbid attraction of undeath. They formed an evil cult of necromancers and went to the north to found a city of their own. This city was called Drefia, and it soon became a source of the foulest corruption.\nThe humans, who were not used to such challenges, were full of sadness and despair, and many cursed the gods who apparently watched their plight in apathy. Little did they understand that all this was part of the gods' plan. It would take the humans a long time to understand that the very purpose of their race was to fight evil, and that their fate was not eternal bliss but endless struggle.",

Protected on all sides by the sea or by insurpassable mountains, the Kha'labal was the perfect environment for the young, vulnerable race to flourish. And flourish and thrive it did. Guided by their leader Banor and endowed with amazing technical skills and knowledge by their creators, the humans managed to settle the whole Kha'labal within few generations, and beautiful buildings rose to the sky, the mightiest of which were to be found in the majestic city of Ankrahmun.

What's more, the hyena king is said to be truly immortal, for it has been sighted time and again by numerous travellers and merchants. Many a caravan is said to have fallen prey to this ferocious beast, and it is widely believed to have amassed untold treasures over the centuries. The legend goes that this beast was once a common hyena that was born in the time when the djinn war was at its peak. Somehow it had managed to escape the cataclysmic firestorm unleashed by the Efreet during the battle of Ankrahmun, and when the slaughter had finally ended it fed from the bodies of the fallen djinns, consuming large amounts of magical energy in the process. Perhaps these magical energies were responsible for the fateful mutation that turned a common hyena into this frightful beast.",

And the prophet said the famous words: \"The fear of death is but a trifle compared to the fear of life.\" So Gabel, who was more and more intrigued by the human, asked him whether he did not care at all about his life? Daraman just looked into the mighty djinn king's eyes, and a brief smile shone on his lips. And after a long pause he spoke thus: \"I am an old man and I have but little to lose, mylord. But your race has much to gain, for it lives in darkness.\" When he said those words many djinns were outraged by the human's apparent lack of respect.

In the beginning he was still convinced that the prophet, like all other humans, was driven by a secret weakness, and he tried to use many other temptations to test the prophet. He clad the old man in silk and offered him a thousand gifts. But Daraman was as unimpressed by the djinns' fabulous wealth as he had been unimpressed by their tortures, and he politely rejected all gifts. And when Gabel finally asked him if he did not appreciate his gifts Daraman answered \"Mylord, I am an old man who has little use for pretty baubles.

And Gabel opened his heart and soul to him. When Daraman had seen deep into Gabel's soul he understood the pain and the confusion that lay hidden deep inside it, and he wept bitter tears of pity for Gabel and for the whole of his race, for he saw that the djinn were a forlorn race that had been cast away by its creator. So full of divine compassion were his tears that they froze into immaculate gemstones of pure blue crystal as soon as they left his eyes.

When Malor finally gave the signal his minions attacked the palace in full force, planning to kill Gabel swiftly. Their attack was deadly effective, and the palace guards were quickly overwhelmed. However, Gabel, who had received warning about the conspiracy was saved in time by his trusted aide and friend Fa'hradin. He managed to flee in the darkness, and that very night he started to gather his troops in order to take revenge on the usurper. Malor, on the other hand, had to acknowledge that his plan to get rid of Gabel quickly had failed. And he ordered his followers to prepare for a long-term military engagement.

Both Malor and Gabel tried to win over as many followers as they could, and the need to take a choice war weighed heavily on many a djinn's conscience. Still, few of them managed to remain neutral in this terrible war, and so a deep rift opened within the djnn race. Families were torn apart as children turned against their parents and brother fought brother. Worst of all, it soon turned out that both sides were roughly equal in strength, so that even though a number of vicious battles ensued it become more and more apparent that victory could not be won easily in this war. In fact, it appeared more and more likely that even if one of the sides could win it, it would so be crippled by the endeavour that the very existence of the djinn race would be threatened. Still the war raged on relentlessly. And the mutual hatred between the two fractions, who began to call themselves by the distinct names of Marid and Efreet, increased with every battle that was fought.",

Unwilling to take any risks in the unpredictable halls and passageways of Drefia's dungeons, the Marid performed a fearsome ritual. The tortured earth underneath Drefia started moving like a giant whirlpool, and slowly the unholy city was pulled inside the maelstrom. Within half an hour it was gone completely, and all but the highest buildings were completely covered by sand and by rubble.

And so it came to pass that the magic lamp was created and, by means that are unknown to this very day, secretly placed in Malor's private chamber. The mighty Efreet never had a chance. When he went to sleep in what he thought was his private lamp he was trapped inside the lamp, which was soon enough smuggled out of Mal'Ouquah, the Efreets' fortress, and brought back to the Marid. Fa'hradin's trick had worked - Malor was Gabel's prisoner.",

Gabel immediately contacted the Efreet to let them know their leader was his prisoner, but his hopes that the rebellion would collapse without Malor were disappointed. The Efreet hated their Marid cousins too much to yield, and so the war continued. Nonetheless, both sides tried to avoid open conflicts, so there was next to no combat action for a long, long time. In fact, both the Marid and the Efreet planned to wait until their ranks would be replenished. But the losses they had suffered were great, and the djinns are not a fertile race. Century upon century passed and still their numbers had increased little. And while elsewhere the human race rose to power, building beautiful cities and establishing powerful empires, the djnn lived quiet in their remote fortresses. Malor, however, remained imprisoned in Fa'hradin's lamp, oblivious to the strange land his guardians had taken him.",

Little did he know that these were very the lands where many centuries later a race of goblinoid barbarians called the orcs chose to erect a mighty fortress. One fateful day the lamp was found and brought to the orc king. It did not take the king's shamans long to work out that a mighty spirit was caught in the lamp, and soon enough the reckless king released the mighty djinn that had lain dormant for so many centuries. Little is known about what happened next, but even though to this day the orcs claim their king is still alive there are no credible witnesses who confirm that they have seen the orc king ever since. Malor, however, freely roams the world again, and many scholars agree that he will try every trick in the book to rekindle the fire of the djinn war.",

But after I was in the magic web I lost control. So I came out near Carlin although I wanted to come out near the east gate of Thais.\nAll others made the same experience.\nIt went all so quickly when I was in the magic web. I could only see a red light and some other gates far away for some seconds. And then I was already in Carlin.\nMaybe one day we can just teleport into the magic web and stay there.

I-VI\". But could this book really be a guide for adventurers? I am not quite sure. It is rather confusing to read these books. A lot of stories were told, but do these stories really belong to each other? Could these people really exist? I doubt it! Once a traveller came to me, who wanted to convince me that Netlios stories are real. I asked him to tell me the names (in alphabetical order), the ages, the reasons why they stopped their journeys and the length of their adventures.\nAt the beginning, I wanted him to give me the first name, his reasons and all this.\nHe wispered:\n\"Anaso, 38, troll attacked, 66 days\".\nI asked him to tell me about the next person:\n\"Elaeus, 40, steped into fire, 100 days\".\nI also asked him about the last three persons, and he gave me his answers.\nAt the beginning, his words seemed plausible to me. But after thinking about it and reading parts of Netlios' stories again, I noticed, that this can't be true.\nA lot of people came to me, bringing \"their\" versions of (wrong) solutions to my questions. There was never someone, who was able to give me a correct answer...\nDoes an answer exist? If it does: How does it look like?\nI decided to give a reward to the first one, who is able to tell me the correct answer.",

First,\nshortly after our world was created, the were just stones and earth. There were small stones, big stones, gray and brown\nstones, sharp and round stones. Some of these stones looked very much like today's seeds; that isn't just per chance.\nObviously, some of the round, small, brown stones,which were somehow placed some fingerlength deep in the earth, started\ngrowing in the directions of the sun - in the opposite direction of hell. That is how plants and trees were created\n- big trees came out of big stones, small plants out of small stones.\n\nNow one may ask oneself (or me): How did animals come into the world?\nI thought really long about this question, and I obviously found the correct answer.\n\nOnce there were plants existing they started \"mixing\" with stones:\nPlants are living objects (just like\nanimals are), but they can't move very fast (animals move fast). Stones on the other hand do not live, but they can\nmove very fast (think about stones falling down a mountain).\n\nThat's how animals and monsters started to exist.",

Well, there are not very many sources of drinks: First, you can take some potions of water with you. Second, you can \"find\" something on your way. For example, you might cross a river or perhaps it might rain one day or the other. And maybe you can even find drinks on your way, but be careful! You never know what is inside the potion you find. Let me again give you an example to illustrate this:\nOne of our five men travelling through Tibia (his name was longer than the name of the adventurer, who was attacked by a troll and therefore had to stop his exploration) one day found a filled potion on his way. He was very thursty, and so he drank the liquid inside. He didn't know (how should he?) that it was poisoned. After some moments he noticed, that he felt worse and worse. At this moment, he had to stop and return to his house. By the way, the name of this man (the poisoned one) was shorter than the name of the man, whose journey was over after 83 days.",

The oldest among these men was aged 42; the youngest was 38, when he started to discover new areas of our land. None the five was as old as anyone else of them. One journey ended after 83 days, one after 117 and finally one after 134 days. Anaso, one of the explorers, was a very brave sword-fighter. His brother Elaeus, who started an expedition just like his brother, never wanted to use a sword - instead he was an excellent magician. Hestus, another explorer whom i will tell about, always wore green trousers, so no-one saw how dirty it was and he never had to wash it.",

Thus, five would be called \"tutututumog\". It doesn't seem to me as if they would have highly developed mathematics, but the way to count seems sufficient for them. I wonder, how they were able to build this town...?\nMaybe an answer is, that they do not speak about numbers, but have short signs for writing them down.\nIt was surprising for me to find out they have a word for \"zero\", namely \"mog\". I hope to find out more in the next days.\nStrangely, they use words for numbers in each context they use numbers. So, \"umog\" stands for one, but also for \"once\", \"one time\", \"first\", ...",

You won't need them, but it keeps the crowds amused.\n2. Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricked player. Clone him a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tendious selection and training.\n3. Put your team and the opposite team in a large field and build a high wall around them.\n(The reason for this is that, although the game is a major spectator sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine that it's just a lot more exciting than it really is. A crowed that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life-affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history.\n4. Throw lots of assorted equipment over the wall for the players. Anything will do -- cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis rackets, skis, anything you can get a good swing with.\n5. The players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand.\nWhenever a player scores a 'hit' on another player he should immediately run away and apologize from a save distance. Apologies should be concise, sincere, and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone.\n6. The winning team should be the first team that wins.",

It should be mentioned, though, that if the heart is partly missed or if the object is not large enough, the vampire might still be able to move.\nSince a vampire is dead anyway, none of these methods allows to destroy a vampire for good. With enough time and blood, a vampire can recover from any of those seeming deaths. The only known way to permanently defeat a vampire is to kill him with a blessed stake.

Of the natural undead, little use can be made, for they obey their own strong will and will not be bended or made to pursue more noble fashions after our own will; so the most noble art of a necromancer lies in besting the natural course, indeed, in perfectioning it, and in bringing back life in death, and creating able-bodied subjects to carry out the most noble purposes of our order.",

        "text": "On the Nature of the Undead, Vol. 1\nVol. I, Chapter 1\nAs I have said in my preface, we have to discern between two main categories of undead: the \"natural\" and the \"technical\" undead. The natural undead make up for most of the undead types; and we have but to wonder at the mean understanding of the outsiders to our art not seeing this. I will begin my dissertation with categorizing the undead, beginning with the natural undead in this first chapter, followed by a categorization of the technical undead in the second chapter. The means of resurrecting the undead will be studied and an ample introduction be given by my honoured colleague, professor rer. mort. Arrazul Alhazri in his book \"An Initiation to Practical Necromancy\".\nThus, to return to our study: the nature of the undead. The natural undead,  like ghosts and vampires, are indeed abundant on this world. Many have been spotted in the different locations in Tibia, and all seem to pursue a singular goal, which they have been denied in life and which they therefore seek to achieve in undeath.  As many of the lesser mortals that inhabit the lands of Tibia are not able to reach their goals in life, one must not wonder at the abundancy of the natural undead.\nTo the natural undead, we count the following specimen with their sub-classifications:\n1.\tGhosts:\na)\tspectres\nb)\tspirits\nc)\tphantasms\nd)\t apparitions\n2.\tbanshees\n3.\treapers\n4.\tvampires\na)\tvampire bats\nb)\tvampire brides\nc)\tvampire lords\n5.\t Special consideration must be given to the hybrid classes:\na)\t lesser forms of demon spirits\nb)\tGhouls\nc)\tmummies",

Death is but the portal, not the end; it is but an artificial hindrance to ward off the lesser spirits from the realm of the mighty; and the gods put it up to prevent us Chosen from ascension to their own powers, and threaten their dominion. These shackles to our existence are unnatural; but it is natural to rebel and to seek power, yes, to gain power, to exert power! Brothers, we must overcome this hindrance set up by the jealous gods and claim our rightful place! We are the masters of the living and undead, the true lords of the created, and nothing shall stop us from achieving what we seek.",

        "text": "The Iks\nA Disquisition (abridged) by the venerable Sir Galthen\nThe tale of Iksupan, the City of Gold, is of a vast kingdom of old. Once prospering and shining in the radiance of its own glory it did not sink to perish like many a lost world: it was taken. To grasp the full magnitude of this most peculiar end, one has to understand the lore and culture of a very ancient part of this world. Due to a lingering fear of the wrath of Kopakhn, god of the balance of life, the people of the Tribe of Iks have been building vast underground cities and palaces. Kopakhn was thought to be the bringer of a cleansing storm, sweeping over the face of the known world. Destroying man, animal and growth alike. So the Iks saw their only salvation in taking to the innards of this earth while forestalling the cleansing by conquering as much of their known world as possible. To appease him, the Iks amassed a wealth of treasure, conquered all the lands of their ancestors and built intricate structures of stone and gold deep underground. Their sincere worship of Kopakhn was also a gesture of gratitude towards his might and divine judgement. Feeling safe in their untiring contributions towards the great goal of the propitiation of their powerful god, their civilisation thrived. The more kingdoms they seized, the more wealth they hoarded, the further they would reach.\nWhen conquerors came from distant parts of the world, the Iks prevailed. Lured by the gold and wealth of their sanctuaries build in the name and spirit of their gods, many foreign knights and mercenaries would invade their sacred grounds. Driven by the lust for riches and glory, the invaders would come ever further and soon roam the lands of the Iks in great numbers. Fending off the foreign aggressor month after month, year after year, the Iks grew angrier and more relentless. They blamed their gods and even Kopakhn became a subject of their ire. The people lost faith in their deities and blamed their priests and sages. In fear of losing control, the highest caste of the Iks tried to uphold order by demanding sacrifices to Kopakhn as well as Tikatl, god of lightning, rage and war. And sacrifices where made. The steps of the great sanctuary of Kopakhn ran red with blood. The worshippers of Tikatl built large outside structures with high beams made of pure gold to attract his mighty thunder and sweeping lightning. Man and animal alike where presented and delivered to the wrath of the furious priests and their angry gods. Their victims in battle would suffer dark rituals and wild ceremonies to feed their souls directly to Tikatl, presenting the hearts to the ever watching Kopakhn.\nThen came the time of the iron haze. An otherworldly mist fell on many settlements and underground sanctuaries. The day the mist arrived would mark the end of any such habitat. Inhaling this haze seemed to have a strange benumbing effect on every living creature and even the walls and the very gold and stone the Iks built their mighty empire upon. After the mist cleared, the iron silenced the few Iks still able to stand. Like leaves brought by a swift wind, sharp blades and quick knives danced through the golden chambers. Room after room emptied of life, torches choked, the fires dead like the people of the Iks lying scattered amongst unfathomable riches. Priest, guard and worker alike, all betrayed, their bones shattered and their souls hurt in disbelief, doubting their gods. Word of these occurrences travelled through the Ikian world and its remaining people fled their homes, temples and sanctuaries. During a long and burdensome time of nomadism far away from their ancestral realm, the Iks all but disappeared. They never recovered and ultimately died in exile.",

Was the ultimate sacrifice of their souls over challenging the fear of the wrath of a vengeful god their downfall? It will probably never be known.\nLegend has it, that the last remnants of the exiles once again built a home under the earth, deep down, made of stone and gold and filled with riches beyond belief (a scribbled note says Iksupan and \"Ik'kal\" after this sentence) . The final exiles are believed to have never returned to the surface. A lost tribe, forever wandering their golden city in the deep, the entrance sealed shut for no god nor man to ever find them again.",

        "text": "The Fall of the Astral Shapers by Teruvax Tristem - Part 3\nSlavery did the Shapers no good. It is said that some of them just withered away and died within a few months. Also, the birth rate dropped dramatically. Two generations later the race of the Shapers was no more - or so it seemed. Some of them had managed to flee to remote areas filled with magic. The strong fluxes of magic there allowed them to erect secret forges to harness their power without being seen by the other greedy races.\nFor the hidden Shapers these secret bases became a beacon of hope. While the rest of their civilisation perished, some elite survived in hiding. However, since their network was utterly destroyed, most of their vast knowledge was lost forever.\nEven worse, the Astral Shapers had been so accustomed to access the network that they found themselves unable to handle the knowledge of their ancestors. Access to recourses necessary to operate their complicated artefacts had been lost as well. Often lacking important skills needed for day-to-day survival, the whole race seemed doomed. Many hideouts became death traps that turned into tombs for those who had hoped to find salvation there. Only a very small number of these colonies managed to survive for a significant amount of time. The harsh environment of the hideouts took a heavy toll on the survivors and slowly moulded them into new beings who only remotely resembled the noble figures of their ancestors.\nThe Shapers have been forgotten for a long time and their accomplishments seemed to be lost. Recently, however, the great archaeologist Darama Smith uncovered some ancient tomes which led him on many adventures. On his expeditions he rediscovered two of the underground complexes which had been thought to be lost forever. Astonishingly, one of them was still populated with the degenerated descendants of the Shapers. Unfortunately, both facilities were destroyed in fights between the adventurous archaeologist and the minions of the evil mastermind Professor Maxxen. Some knowledge, however, could be salvaged and some insights into the history of the Shapers could be gained and shared.",

        "text": "The Fall of the Astral Shapers by Teruvax Tristem - Part 2\nThe Astral Shapers relied more and more on their slaves' workforce as well as on their knowledge network. This situation worked well for them for a while. But then a new powerful warlord arose. The wars were often a back and forth like the tides of the sea. This was the way things were and the races had grown accustomed to it. This new warlord, however, was tired of that game. He decided to eliminate the one advantage that turned the tides of battle once and for all. Instead of fearing to lose the support of the Shapers by fighting them, he speculated on bolstering his own strength if he managed to steal the Shapers' powers somehow.\nThe Shapers were no longer prepared for war. Their slave troops, equipped with magically boosted weapons, were labourers not fighters. Moreover, they harboured no love for their masters. The more remote communication towers were the first to fall. This led to confusion and fear among the Shapers. The gaping holes in their communication were highly disturbing, leaving blind spots all over the realm. In this state of disarray, the first cities of the Shapers fell quickly.\nAs word spread about the actions of the warlord, another flaw became evident. Greedy as the Shapers had been, they had made some humble customers but never friends. When the other races heard about the warlord's success, they feared for their own power. To show the warlord their good will, they started to attack the Shapers, too. Things snowballed as even the more benevolent races decided to join in. After all they could not afford to leave all of the Shapers' knowledge and powers to their enemies.\nSoon the Shapers' cities were razed to the ground by a tidal wave of armies. In a last-ditch effort some of the Shapers used their quickly dwindling knowledge to forge themselves into living weapons. This, however, only led to more severe retaliation against the Shaper populace. Within less than a decade the cities of the Shapers lay in ruins. Their people were enslaved and deported into remote realms.\nThe enslaved Shapers lacked most of the knowledge they had once shared. In an effort to recreate the lost knowledge, several of the captor races squeezed out each bit of knowledge from their captives and compiled them into so-called Shaper records. The fragmentary knowledge they acquired was hardly of any practical use. Moreover, the different races were unwilling to share the records with each other. For this reason, a reconstruction of the Shapers' work was impossible.\nDuring this time, a vast number of Shaper records was created and even copied. However, when the astral forges fell into disrepair, the records were considered worthless. Instead of gathering and comparing the records, they were soon forgotten.\nUnable to operate the Shapers' forges, most of them were destroyed by the conquering races. They did not want to risk them falling into the wrong hands.",

        "text": "The Fall of the Astral Shapers by Teruvax Tristem - Part 1\nNowadays the beings commonly known as the Astral Shapers have largely been forgotten. Back in the days, however, they were one of the most important races of the God Wars. Favoured by Uman and Zathroth alike, they were blessed with a unique kind of vision that enabled them to see magical structures and flows. Their speech was a mixture of verbal communication and magical emanations. Their true name was a mixture of barely pronounceable syllables and magical symbols. For this reason, the other races of that time referred to them as Astral Shapers or just Shapers.\nTheir keen understanding of magical structures was oddly paired with a very structured and logical way of thinking. Therefore, the Shapers were never really fond of spontaneous magic based on spells. From the beginning, they preferred to imbue objects with magical effects. While this might have been only a preference in the earlier days of their civilisation, it later became an integral part of their culture, going so far that spell magic was frowned upon as something primitive, dangerous and offensive.\nIn their earliest days the Astral Shapers were relatively insignificant. Some of them were enslaved or hired as advisors for all kind of magical matters. The creation of enormous, magical towers in their cities was their first major accomplishment. Those towers somehow connected the minds of all Shapers in a city and enabled them to access some sort of hive mind in which they stored and shared their knowledge.\nWith these shared insights the Shapers' technology made vast progress in a short amount of time. The advances that they made in terms of technology led to a rapid growth in their power and status. This allowed them to construct more towers which were increasingly technologically advanced. Eventually all of the Shaper cities were connected via a network of Shaper towers. Having access to the shared knowledge of a whole nation, the progress to advance the science of bound magic gained momentum and seemed unstoppable. Focusing on knowledge, the wars that ravaged the world became a tedious annoyance for the Shapers. Eventually they assumed a neutral position. When the other races realised that the Shapers were willing to provide their knowledge to everybody who was willing to pay the right price, they grudgingly accepted the Shapers' new status. This allowed the Astral Shapers to explore the depths of magic freely without having to deal with the bickering of the other races of their time.\nFor a while the Shapers prospered. However, their special status and the constant flattering of the other races that wanted their favours turned the Shapers vain and greedy. Seeing themselves as higher beings, they increasingly relied on slaves for the more mundane tasks. Often the Shapers were paid in slaves for their services. These unfortunate slaves served under their uncaring masters until they died.",

This means the reader can only rely on his words. Even worse, obvious speculations are presented hand in hand with the few verified historical facts without any distinction. He even goes so far to omit any historical facts that do not fit into his own theories.\nIf you like to read a book about fiction instead of solid facts, you might find his work entertaining. However, for everybody who is really interested in science, the lack of validity is simply underwhelming.",

        "text": "UMO Abductions by Teruvax Tristem\nAbductions by unknown magical objects (UMO) have been reported from the earliest days of mankind and even before. Above all, fertile races have been targets of these abductions. Orcs lead the statistics of known abductions by UMOs, followed by mankind. This suggests that breeding purposes are the main reason for these abductions.\nOnly about one third of the abducted beings return, albeit with a lack of memory. Their relatives often report that the personality of the abducted has 'changed' in a disturbing way.\nThe UMOs are often described as floating, colourful lights accompanied by a phenomenon that resembles a paralyse spell. Even if a group encounters such an UMO, only particular individuals are abducted. Several of those who had been returned became victims of such abductions repeatedly.\nConsidering their abilities, it is obvious that the UMOs are somehow connected to the magic forces. Furthermore, the UMOs seem to be entities rather than vehicles or something like that. Some scientists believe that the UMOs have developed from pure magic to sentient beings, probably caused by some experiments by an extinct race during the God Wars. According to another valid theory, the UMOs are actually souls of an extinct race that has been banished into the astral realm by some catastrophe. Since they do not have a body of their own, they abduct beings in order to create new host bodies through breeding.\nTaking into consideration for how long the abductions have been taking place now, the UMOs must have made some progress. Their might even be agents of them among us in a human or orcish body who work hand in hand with their bodiless brethren. These agents infiltrate society to further their own cause, either by looking for appropriate breeding candidates or by discrediting or withholding records about UMO activities. They might also initiate smear campaigns to ruin the reputation of researchers who are close to uncover their dark secret.\nSince governments are a major target of infiltration, one wonders who is the driving force behind certain secret services and their activities.\nDid the Venorean trade ship in the far north really have an accident, or was it an attempt to prevent that the ship discovered a hidden UMO base?\nThe more we ask for answers, the more silence we find. Is this evidence that infiltration is real and that the minions of the UMOs are amongst us? I think, yes it is! Be aware! Always look up to the sky when it's dark!",

Those criminals were probably the first pirates although is unlikely that they had more than a few fishing boats at their disposal. They built some rooms in the caverns but supposedly they found evidence of prior attempts to use the grotto in some way and some of the caverns seemed to be not natural. For some reasons they were attracted to the lower caves where the howling of the wind was that fierce that people said it could drive a man crazy. Be that as it may, those first pirates were known for their bloodthirst, their frequent infightings and for torturing their prisoners. It is assumed that they all killed themselves in their madness. The grotto is rumoured to be haunted by the ghosts of these pirates and those of their victims - but those are is only unconfirmed speculations. Nowadays, nobody knows the treacherous passages through the dangerous reefs to reach the isle of Nargor.",

        "text": "The godslayer races\nAs with the ascensonist movement, the godslayer cults are incredibly old. Although the term 'races' is usually applied, this generalization is not a correct one. Indeed the first of those cults where founded by ancient races, most long forgotten, that suffered greatly in the creation wars. Most of those races only barely escaped complete extinction and none ever recovered from the blood toll of the wars. In fact some of those 'races' are rumored to have been reduced to a handful of beings or even a single entity. However some of them tried to gain converts from the younger races to bolster their ranks. The methods to keep their races and cults alive over the centuries differed and most tries were in vain. It's assumed that in our days only a handful of godslayer cults exists and perhaps another handful of single entities that follow this agenda. Be it as it may, for sure is that the name godslayer defines and summarizes their philosophies, or at least the ends of these philosophies. Their\ngoal is nothing less than the extermination of the gods (or in some cases of a specific god). The means through which this goal is to be achieved differ, if they are clear at all. Most cultists are probably content with hating the gods and\nspreading discord among their worshipers. Some might have very specific plans as the last of the Rardor, Tel'Chac Agur, who tried to take over the soulvortex in the early new ages. In most cases a godslayer cult surfaced, it was handled by human worshipers of the gods without real divine interference. It's said though, that the destruction of the isle Molinora was caused by the dark magic\nof Zathroth and his demon armies and the last of the dark race of Souleaters (also known as the Noshar) were annihilated with their dark temple and forbidden secrets they had collected in this last retreat of that cruel race.",

        "text": "Behind The Veil Of Ignorance II\nThe concentrated knowledge is said to be that strong, that it can absorb even the mightiest, turning his essence into another few pages of one of the books. \nThe endless library knows no limits or bounds. Zathroth's teachings say that knowledge is infinite and so is his library.\nIt is said in the beginning the library was only the virtual shadow that was cast by Umans hallowed halls of enlightenment, but the shadow grew with each secret that was kept, each piece of knowledge that wasn't meant to be known. And so dark secrets gave birth to even more twisted insights.\nSince its creation the hoard feasts on secrets and knowledge. It grows and spawns new rooms and chambers, hidden passages and halls of displaced geometry. \nIn the case of the hidden library, the phrase that 'knowledge is power' becomes reality in that the power of the accumulated knowledge manifests in reality bending ways that seem to mock the very concepts of time, space and existence. \nFanatics of Zathroth claim that the library also contains at least parts of 'the true speech', the first and only true language, the syllables the gods whispered at the dawn of creation. Each word, eons long, containing the power to create or destroy, shredding its speaker out of existence.\nKnowledge hidden in lies, truth gained by insanity, enlightenment by force of will combined with greed and selfishness that leads to power: these are the hallmarks of the shrouded hoard.\nThough they enviously protect the hoard, Zathroth and his minions tempt the powerful with glimpsing visits of the hoard. If they prove ruthless and powerful enough to force their way into it. The reward is of course a poisoned one since one shed of forbidden knowledge is never enough. The taste of knowledge seeds a hunger that becomes unbearable to overcome. Everything but more dark knowledge loses its worth and the tainted view of the world becomes cynical and dull. Things once held in value don't matter anymore and the only pleasure one can experience is gaining more knowledge - and even that has to be more substantial yet obscure with every time. This spiral into mad-stricken greed leads many to compile knowledge on their own, figure out forbidden things and bind them into new tomes that one day mysteriously make their way into the hoard with their author vanished under curious circumstances.",

Some of it was written by themselves, others were donations of worshipers and others simply bought. When the great purge came, the hidden library as it was called, was seized and destroyed by the Inquisition. The books were secured and given to the priests of Uman to be reviewed, along with any artifacts that were found. Everything that was deemed blasphemous was destroyed by them. The worldly possessions such as land, gold and jewelry fell to the crown. The library was dismantled stone by stone and its caverns filled with earth. No sign of the library remained, though desperate Zathrothi still claimed it was not the real hoard of their divine patron that was destroyed but only an insignificant mimicry of the true place. Since the Inquisition could not prove these claims to be true, all of them have to be assumed wishful thinking of desperate Zathroth worshipers and propaganda for their underground movement.",

        "text": "Magnor Mournbringer was more a mystic and philosopher than a knight. It is said he was forced into knighthood by his father, albeit himself aspiring to become a sorcerer. He was more a man of the books than of the sword, more often found in the study then on a jousting field. He was permanently banished from tournaments for the usage of alchemical concoctions. Still obligated to fight in battles on behalf of his king he relied more on sorcery then on his physical prowess. He enchanted and inscribed first his armour and weapons, later even his own body. He enhanced his skill and fortitude through powerful potions and brought his enemies down with runes and spells. The other knights shunned him but the 'witch-knight', as they called him, had his uses for the king. Giving little for chivalrous staples and being very pragmatic, the witch-knight was the one that the king called upon, when a dirty deed had to be done, something sinister to be accomplished. As times were dark and dire, the call for his skill was frequent. His fame and notoriety grew. On the height of his might and favour of the king he was nigh untouchable, reigning freely in his realm. Dubious visitors from all corners of the world frequented him. Rumours grew even more then his legend. When his patron, the king surprisingly died and not his sickly child was crowned but his pious cousin was made regent of the realm, his enemies made their complaints heard loudly. Soon the inquisition investigated in the case and it came to a direct confrontation when they tried to size Magnor's vast library for examination. Blows were traded and in the end the keep of Magnor was besieged by the regents army. With no other way to escape, the witch-knight summoned winged demons to carry him into safety. But the priests, accompanying the army, banished the creatures and Magnor fell to his death. When the regency ended and the king's son became ruler, Magnors honor was reinstated to some extent in memory of the dead king that cherished him. So he was given a proper funeral.",

        "text": "Elves by Iregarn Pt. 1\nElven names are chosen in adulthood. Until they acquire a name, elves are called 'son/daughter of ___' usually naming the parent with the same gender. Upon reaching adulthood, the young elf gets his first name, divined by the elders who know him in dreams. It is merely a single name, a description of the elf in the elven tongue.  Usually elves love to add a translation of their name which is often mistaken for a second name by other races. Since the elven language is far more complicated and has thousands of nuances, often elves with the same 'second name' have a different first name, confusing the other races even more.",

        "text": "The History Of King Zelos I\nKing Ottremar was a wise and pious ruler. Through his lifetime the realm went through numerous changes and reforms that benefitted the realm as a whole. His prodigous son Paron was destined to follow him as a competent ruler to lead the realm to further prosperity. Yet the king's younger son Olbret was as ambitious as jealous. He plotted the assassination of his sibling, in league with sinister forces. With promises of the restoration of former grandeur he allied himself with elements of the secret church of Zathroth. However, by chance or divine intervention of the gods, the inquisition discovered the plot and arrested Olbret. But by then he already managed to place a potent poison for Paron to which the latter succumed within a week, despite all efforts of healers and clergery. So a distant cousin of the brothers, Zelos, was named successor of the old king. This decision did not suit well with some of the most powerful nobles in the realm. This dispute overshadowed the last years of Ottremar, now a broken man, becoming more and more fragile with each passing week. When Zelos took the mantle of kingship, the boiling anger erupted. With reluctant nobles disputing the new king's right to rule, the once prospering realm was on the brink of open rebellion. Zelos was well aware of his shortcomings in regard of ruler ship. After being named successor he had dedicated himself to the studies of the kings that had come and gone in the past. When he became king and with civil war on the horizon, he decided that books weren't efficient and fast enough to teach him the needed skills. He decided to learn from the source itself instead. He consulted spiritists, shamans and even necromancers to summon the spirits of the kings of old to act as his advisors. This again arose the suspicion of the inquisition and even increased inner tensions. More and more desperate, Zelos turned not only to the advice of some reluctant ancestors but almost any spiritual entity that was willing to listen to his plea and to teach. Some of those spirits were more persistent and did not leave, once called into the world. So Zelos was soon hearing voices and whispers all day and even in his sleep. It is hard to say which of his later decisions were entirely his and which were the result of such dark whispers or even his own growing insanity. Yet his first steps proved to be a success, at least from his point of view.",

Supposedly the progenitor of their race, it became old and bloated, only fed by its offspring through sacrifices.\nIn the god wars, its reverence reached a high, as all the blood from the countless battles could be used to feed it. It grew immensely in size and power, eventually bursting out of its hideout and crawling over the battlefields, devouring and consuming the fallen and wounded alike. As the battles raged, the god of blood was widely ignored by the warring parties. Eventually, the creature became so bloated on blood and corpses that it could no longer sustain its form and just burst into disgusting remains that littered the entire world. These splinters infected other creatures and gave rise to new generations of vampires. However, these vampires are seen as abominations by the first pure and true vampires.",

With his enemies and their forces occupied and being oblivious of his true intentions, his state troops seized their families and brought them as hostages into the capital. The nobles were outraged but powerless against this threat. Zelos was unmoved by their threats and pleas. After an execution of certain family members just as an example the nobles grudgingly gave in. With raised taxes and tariffs Zelos raised more troops and began to rule with an iron fist. He crushed the orcs and two minor rebellions which he used to justify a demilitarisation of the nobles to quell their strength even further. Zelos also became a collector of magic artifacts, with knowledge of their whereabouts provided to him by his spiritual guides. His insight into the plans of his enemies grew more and more by either spiritual informants or scrying devices he acquired. He now regularly consulted spirits and manifested ghosts as advisors, messengers, bodyguards and even assassins. More and more though, instead of ruling, he could be found mumbling to himself, lost in inner dialogue or arguing with unseen spirits. Soon he became known by his subjects as the ghost king. More and more he withdrew into his tower in the palace, relying more and more on ghostly messengers to communicate with his court. Oddly enough he was a strong supporter of the inquisition, though most claim it was just his reluctance to share his power with anyone. Under his reign the inquisition became twisted and changed, cutting many ties to the churches and been more and more responsible to king and crown. The purges of this inquisition often targeted the very same sources on which he himself once so heavily relied upon and many confiscated talismans and objects found their way into his hands. At some point he shut himself off from the public completely. Yet while he received food and water, his only contact with the outside world took place via ghost messengers or him attending council meetings remotely, due to arcane devices. In the 98th year of his unnatural long reign a still pious branch of the inquisition breached his tower in a coup. No one, save the top members of the inquisition, know what they actually faced in this tower but the day after, king Zelos was declared dead. His successor was yet another young cousin of his. Ilgram had already build up a strong support from the repressed nobility and proved to become a beloved king that renewed the realm to its former glory, casting away the gloom that the ghost king had cast over the land.",

        "text": "Baron Eserak was the spiritual leader of a knightly order, devoted to the service of the gods. As a gathering of philosophical and pious men and women, the order often met in debates on spiritual matters. Often such debates lead to heated argument because most members were extremely set in their opinions and points of view in religious matters. Over the time two fractions arose that at least vaguely agreed on crucial points to which the other faction strongly disagreed. Heated debates led to violent arguments and over the time this bred an atmosphere of hatred. When Eserak learned that the opposing faction secretly planned to split he saw his grand plan in danger. He gathered his most loyal and devoted members and lead them in a violent purge of the dissenters. The once wise and serene man had become infuriated about what he saw as the ultimate betrayal and he was not willing to show any mercy. But even after the purge of the order he would not find his peace. The shock of the defection by so many of his former brethren and sisters left him paranoiac. Seeing traitors everywhere he lead several more purges and was driven so far as to burn several of his loyal friends on the base of dubious suspicions. Listening to false advisors his harsh actions lead to the loss of many members, either because they were killed as heretics or because they left the order in disgust. Since the knights of the order hailed from some of the most powerful families of the realm, the schism spilled over into a civil war. The weakened order and their supporters were greatly outnumbered and to restore peace even the crown sided with its enemies. Unwilling to be brought to an - in his eyes heretic - trial, he took his own live before he could be arrested.",

I was quite surprised when while examining the unkempt, dirty man I recognized that this tattered and stained clothes at one time must have been regal and noble. For most times all he would utter were animalistic sounds and growls. I could see how the simple people of the hamlet would assume he was raised by animals or a hermit that had gone mad due to loneliness. With patience and diligence though, I managed to calm him down. Although it took days until the first time, he mumbled something that could be interpreted as words. Sadly from that point on my progress was halted. There was no way to get more out of him, then a few words and even them were rather random. He could be soothed by my words but though the words and phrased he uttered were proof that he knows my language well, he showed no reaction to anything I said, beyond reacting to the tone of my voice. It was as if he'd been trapped in his own mind. Strangely enough 'things' started to happen in his presence. Things moved when not watched, milk turned sour, food rotted away in minutes and I could not get rid of the feeling that sometimes we were watched by some unseen presence. In all his utterings only three things were prominent and consistent. 'The library', 'knowledge' and 'Zathroth' were the words he mentioned most and which usually were followed by screaming, cramps and the aforementioned manifestations. The superstitious villagers first refused to take care of him for a few more days on their own, while I acquired a carriage to bring him to the academy, where he could be examined and treated more appropriately, but I convinced them about my authority and they gave in. When I returned a few days later though, I found the barn a burned down heap.",

        "text": "My Journeys Trough [sic] Tibia II\nThe villagers claimed the fire started in the night and they claimed, when they came to douse it, they saw 'things' in the flames and the crackling of the fire sounded like a whisper in an unknown but threatening language. I'm still not sure what actually happened that night. It could have been some mere accident of course. But it's also quite possible, that the villagers just could no longer bear the cursed man and took things into their own hands. The more disturbing alternative is, that the manifestations that I ignored as chance happenings and vivid imagination had something to do with the fire. The superstitious people had not dared to look for the corpse, so I ordered the men I brought with me to search the rubble. They easily found the bones of the old man, but their findings were utmost disturbing and to this day the thought about what I had seen sends shivers down my spine. The fire had literally left over nothing but bones, which is not just improbable but rather impossible. The bones, though smeared with ashes, were clean of charred flesh. Even the heart that is almost impossible to burn, was gone. Yet that was not what was strange and disturbing about them. The frightening thing was, that his bones were full of runes written in languages even I did not knew. A few of the marks reminded of glyphs in ancient text that were found at the most remote places of the world, remainders of civilizations that had long gone extinct. How in the world would it be possible to treat the bones of a living man like this? I'm absolutely sure none of the villagers tinkered with the bones nor would anyone have the knowledge to forge such complicated scriptures. I took the bones and sent them to the academy for examination, while I continued my delayed travel. Later I learned that the ship that transported them was lost at sea with no clue about its whereabouts. Of course it could have happened by chance. Ships get lost to all kinds of natural hazards. Yet I have to wonder if I had doomed those sailors when entrusting them with this peculiar cargo.",

Its perfection in everything or at least anything, may it be music, may it be cooking, may it be poetry, may it be war. Secondly its about seeing the perfection in things. A Mooh'Tah master might spend hours in looking at a flower ... or some broken pottery and it's likely he writes a poem or song about it, only to walk into a battle minutes later.

They were a constant source of trouble due to their prophecys of doom and frightening the good citizens of thais with their storys. So one of the thaian kings in his generosity gave them a pice of land near the area that later should become known as plains of havoc. The noble king saw it as both, a challenge to the order to proove their seriousness and as a trainingground  to achive even more insight in the workings of fate. Though many did not understand the wise king in those days and plead the order not to leave, the order of the nightmares left the capital and only a few left the order frightened and exeposed as cowards.\nAfter a while more and more warriors flocked to the order and embraced their strange teachings. Most came for the challenge provided by the nearby plains and its monsters, and the order of doom-prophets became more and more a mockery. The king knew they would eventually fail and did not forbid the foolish to join them. In the end the order was extingiushed in some neeadless battle against undead they provoked (probably pursuing some of their dubious prophecies). Still the wise king had long enough put the misguided there as a shield for the newly founded stelement of venore. In the end only the foresight of the clever king came true. The order did fade away as he expected, unable to live up to their loofty goals but at least their misguided energy was not wasted but used to further the prosperity of the thaian realm.",

But Tha'kull had been one of the mightiest warriors in the wars and his meditations and understanding of the ways of the world gave him the edge.\nWhere his enemies attacked him with rage, he countered them with oversight. Where the enemies tried to hurt him with the powers born from rage, he slew them with elegance. No emotion clouded his fights and he was superior and victorious. The minotaurs of those days were accustomed that might makes right and so it was easy for this first warrior philosopher to gain followers. The harder part was to make them listen and only the patience gained in his meditations let him succeed in the end. After some time his philosophies spread like a wildfire in the minotaur tribes. His and Akkors pupils wandered the world and through example and patience spread their words. The higher teachings of the philosophy were never truly understood by the masses but even the least of them were taught to overcome the hatred and rage that made them tools in a war that was not theirs. By neglecting the rage at first the minotaurs became the prime targets of Blogs other minions but in the end the formidable skills and persistence of the warrior-philosophers combined with the inability to lead a two front war let the followers of Blog lose interest in pursuing the minotaurs who had fled underground and fortified several bases. In the coming years the minotaurs defended their new found freedom with all their might and the principles of their philosophy, known as Mooh'Tah, were founded.",

With the beginning of adolescense the dwarf gets initiated to a cult that is considered suitable for him. The more progressive dwarves who try to change and create something new are initiated as child of the fire, whereas the conservative, preserving dwarves are initiated to the cult of earth. (Sidenote: the mad inventors that embrace 'undwarfish' priciples and concepts are inititated to the technomancers cults and named children of the machine) So two dwarven siblings may claim to be son/daughter of a different element although they share the same biological parents. Later the dwarf gets to choose a brotherhood (which is a imprecise but common translation of the dwarven term which is far better and  literally translates into 'fellowship'). The more aggressive types would choose the savage axes, a rowdy group of dwarves that has some fame to be easily angered. The more patient (sometimes patient to an extent that drives humans nearly mad) would choose the molten rock fellowship and those that are adventurous and even foolhardy risktakers would join the dragoneaters and so on. There are a dozen or so fellowships although only three or four are prominent enough to be commonly known. They could be compared with some kind of social club or guild in human terms.",

It is just a rune with no spell in yet. If you are skilled enough to make the rune and you have enough mana, put the blank rune in your hand and say the words. Spells made to be stored in runes start with the syllable 'AD', so don't mess with them. The rune will be charged with magic power, changing shape, colour and sign, showing that the magic worked. You can use it now just touching it (Right-Click and Use or just Ctrl->click) and then shoot it at the target. The magic will fly from your hand and one of the charges will disappear. Runes have different amount of charges (one to four) and when all charges are used, the rune will just vanish, as if it never existed.",

A city planned by famous architects and built by the finest craftsmen the kingdom could muster. The area was plagued by orcattacks tough and the people and workers became dishearted and afraid. Many left the site for good. So more and more forced labourers and criminals were sent to help in the building process and the finest army of the kindom, the feared 'red legion' was sent as a protective force and to hold the growning number of doubious citizens in check. Seeing the possibility of failure of their greatest project, the royal family of Thais used the growing city of Carlin as a deposit for unwanted thinkers and noble familys that misstepped in the intrigues that plagued the kingdom in those time. Unwanted in the capital but too powerfull to be disposed they were sent to Carlin. Given their wealth and the fertility of the north, the city was not a bad place to live at as long as the legion managed to keep the orcs at bay. Those citizens were joined by some druids that were not comfortable with the power and influence of the thaian sorcerors and their closeness to the royal family. Soon freethinkers and philosophers flocked to carlin and the unrest grew. The focus of the thaian military to internal affairs was increased and the city was ruled with a more iron hand. The governor was not a calm man and seeing the prosperity of the city he got greedy, increasing the taxes to painfull heights. The building of an enourmous castle was begun, a bit northeast of Carlin. Most unfree workers were used for the construction and so soon the city was no longer sufficiently supplied with food. Seeing that only the local druids made it possible to raise enough supplies, the king ordered more druids to travel to carlin, ensuring the supply of the city, the workers and the troops. Still the work progressed slowly.",

The women were forced to learn most crafts needed to run the city and joined the druids in gathering and hunting, learning a lot of helpfull skills from those masters of nature. The exiled sister of the thaian king gained more and more influence in the city and soon some huntresses loyal to her cause started nightly supply raids on the bases of the red legion at the buildingsite. With the stolen food she bought favours and supporters in the still starving city (since most supplies went straight to the red legion). Using their newly learned skills of stalking and laying false tracks, the huntresses blamed the orcs of the region with the raids. The plan worked well - too well. The orcs, frightened due to the presence of the famous red legion whose mercyless brutallity was even known to the orcish hordes had not dared to attack or even harras the humans in the carlin area for some time. After a few of those 'orcraids' that could not be prevented the general of the legion ordered a good part of his troops to attack and anihilate the orcish base. Their known base as a islefortress where they thought themselves save. By night, protected by heavy fog the legion used primmitive rafts to cross the sea to the not so far isle. Their attack was a complete surprise. The  orcs were slaughtered. Most of the higher\nranking orcs were not present in the fortress, partaking in a riutal to find a new chieftain and warlord at the other side of the isle. So the orcs, without leadership were easy prey for the experienced legionaires. After their bloody victory the legion hastily tried to travel back to ensure the crimminals did not take that oportunity for a mutiny. Noone knows if it was magic used by vengefull orc shamans (or even by carlin druids as some claim) or just a force of nature, but a storm struck as the legion was crossing the sea a second time.",

        "text": "The Bonelords Threat III\nThese efforts met with a first, important success when the bonelords managed to create a new kind of undead minion that was capable of acting on its own, without direct control by a bone master. Unfortunately, these minions still lacked intelligence, and although they were unwaveringly loyal they were of little use to their vile masters. And so it came that the bonelords continued their horrible experiments on living and dead ... They stole souls and implanted them, they switched minds and bodies between the dead and the living, but none of the gruesome experiments ever produced the kind of monstrosity they had in mind. \nEventually they started exposing undead bodies to evil energies and merging them with living beings into massive undead monstrosities, which, however, withered and died almost as soon as they were created. After some experiments that failed in an particularly spectacular manner, the bonelords were forced to abandon their experiments. Soon, their gruesome experiments faded from memory. They had been all but forgotten when a number of braindeath emerged in a remote bonelord city, claiming to have achieved a decisive breakthrough in the field of necromancy. The high council of the bonelord elders reluctantly sent a number of scientists down to the laboratories to examine the results. The undead creatures they found were so hideous and degenerated that the scientists flatly declared that these experiments that led their creation contradicted the very principles of the bonelord race. All undead were to be destroyed and the experiments were to be abolished once and for all.\nThe braindeaths, whose own minds had suffered considerably through years of isolation and of unholy experiments, were enraged by this decision. They openly defied the scientists and even the high council. When the elders issued an ultimatum and threatened to destroy the undead by force, the braindeaths rebelled.

But, alas! In the end, they shared the same fate that most other races suffered during the god wars: Yet another race appeared on the scene which proved to be even mightier. They were well protected against the bonelords' magical arsenal, and so it was only a question of time before the bonelords' empire collapsed. The bonelords were replaced by a succession of other races that were chosen by the dark gods to champion their cause. One race followed another, sometimes even before the previous race had become extinct. All the while, the bonelords fared better than most of their successors: Owing to the fact that they had once conquered the whole world, small areas of their civilisation remained even while their once mighty cities disappeared and their mysterious pyramids crumbled to dust. Many bonelords chose to hide below the surface of the world, fighting fierce underground wars to win supremacy over the other races that had fled the surface where the god wars raged on. Their successes were limited, but at least the bonelords managed to establish a number of new subterranean bases, which were safe even though they lacked the grandeur of the bonelords former cities.\nThe bonelords had learnt the bitter lessons from the gruesome wars that had led them to the brink of extinction. They had realised the limitations of their race, and they decided to work on their weaknesses. They found that they had relied too heavily on their intuitive powers in the past, and they decided to improve their innate powers through research and experiments. The dark art of necromancy seemed especially promising, so a group of bonelords concentrated all their efforts towards improving their powers to master the undead.",

Their mighty cities, which characteristically contained ominous dark pyramids, could be found all over the world. The bonelords erected them using the same innate form of telekinesis which lets their bodies float in the air. However, they could not do completely without hands and arms that did their bidding. For this reason they relied on another innate power of their race - the dark power of necromancy. Thanks to the magical abilities of their tentacles, which are capable of producing various powerful kinds of magic to an extent that is denied to other races unless they study for many decades, the bonelords also knew how to command the dead. As a result, they used a monstrous strategy: Whenever they conquered an area they turned their unfortunate victims into undead slaves. Using these undead legions as their shock troops, the bonelords went from victory to victory. They built a huge fortress that served as their power base, and from there they went to conquer the world.",

The power of said entity is disputable and the references to godhood might be exaggerated yet they can't be outright discarded. The entity might have been in existence before the god wars although most resources suggest the god wars were the cause of its existence. It seems likely that, whatever its origin was, it gained significant amount of power due to the god wars. Several sources link this rise of power to the bloodshed in the countless battles of those times. At some point this power leads to the entities downfall though, specifics get a bit more sketchy here. The actual reason and circumstances of it's demise are more then uncertain yet most sources agree that the entity left some kind of legacy, be it in the form of a secret blood cult or in the form of some residue that contained fragments of its power. Most sources link the entity to the origin of vampires or at least identity vampiric creatures as it's followers. The few modern vampires that could be interrogated in that matter claimed ignorance of this history though.",

The vampire priests served as his heralds and prophets and gathered a flock of devout followers, lured into their folds by promises of immortality and power. The inner circle of his priesthood was taught the darkest secrets of the blood. They learned forbidden things that were even unknown to the gods themselves. The truths they learned opened their minds to the true powers of their vampiric forms and elevated them far above their kin. Their splendor and power lured in more and more subjects, willing to undergo the transformation, yet only the most worthy were chosen.\nThis neglect leads to envy though and one of the most powerful among the scorned betrayed the cult and gave away their secrets to their enemies. Yet they were afraid of the might of the blood priests and only when the gods struck down the god of blood they dared to strike on their own, attacking the confused priests and their followers.

The battlefield was a gruesome sight to behold, with blood and gore spilling everywhere. All the carnage and killing gave rise to an entirely new entity. An entity bound to the blood and suffering that the war brought forth. The fury of the war was so intense that the entity rivaled any god in power.\nWhen the gods became aware of its existence the war came to a halt. The existence of the newly created blood god left them startled and horrified. With disgust they looked upon the newly created blood god, which was a blasphemous competitor, an abomination and anathema to them. For once their quarrels were put aside and in unison they struck against this blasphemous competitor. The combined might of the gods was unparalleled, and they unleashed their fury upon the blood god. They tore the entity apart and stripped away any godly essence it might have possessed.\nIn their fury the gods left nothing of the blood god and only splinters and shreds remained.",

The blood goddess was shunned by the other gods for her origin but she was content to dwell in the darkness far away from the other gods and their struggles. When the god wars started and she witnessed all the carnage and mayhem, she sensed that she might become a target too despite her absence from godly affairs. So she prepared herself and used the blood that flowed in the countless battles of the god wars to amplify her strength. However, the newfound surge of power was overwhelming and too much for her to handle, yet she was unable to stop the consumption of power as long as the blood was flowing so freely.\nIn her despair, she pleaded to the gods for help. The gods stopped their struggles in a moment and passed their judgment upon her in the form of death. They struck down the blood mother and ripped her powers into pieces.",

The newly choosen warlords called to the arms and theremaining orcs were joind by their brethren from the woods and smaler isles. This force was joined by some cyclopses and renegade minotaurs which where bribed with gold, metal and promises.  The attack of the orcs struck the remaining red legion with vengefull force. Though hopelessly outnumbered and spread too thin over the titanic construction site the red legion fought a bloody fight. Wherever they could, they built pockets of resistance in a sea of green bodys that swarmed them. Doing so they left the way open to the workers though. The orcs took no prisoners.

Alarmed through the scouts the secretly raised forces of Carlin arived, the huntresses and druids came more for the sake of their male family members of course, than for the red legion, but allas they came too late. As they finally arived the orcs had almost finished their dirty work. The attack of the carlin forces took them  by surprise but the orcs were too numerous. As the orcish resistance began to form the carlin forces retreated. Drawing the orcs after them the huntresses and druids struck and retreated as planned and trained to be done against the red legion. As they made it to the walls of carlin they had thinned out the orcish troops considerably and most allies like the minotaurs were still pundering the construction site. Some druids that were still hidden in the woods used their magic to impersonate orcs and attacked those allies and herded wolves against them. The enraged minotaurs and cyclopses joined forces and were led to the exausted orcs infront of the carlin walls who prepared for a siege. In the battle that erupted between orcs and their enraged former allies the carlin forces started a surprise attack, aimed at the orcish leadership. They managed to kill them swiftly and retreated back. The orcs finally defeated the minotaurs and cyclopses but were too weakend to consider a further attack on the city. They plundered the construction site and destroyed what they could. They razed the foundations for about two weeks before they left. Shaken by the loss of its most powerfull military tool the thaian royals decided to use their remaining forces to ensure the safety of the capital and other holdings rather then to start a war in an area that far away to claim regentship over a city that would be a ghosttown after a war.

Pice for pice their land was torn away and the wisest of the elves found out that the valley would ultimately 'fall' back in the world it belonged to. Great efforts were undertaken to prevent it. All were futile. As this was recognized it was almost too late. All magic was concentrated to preserve the lives of the elves. Protective shells were created, spells to deflect damage, enchantements to keep harm away.\nThe 'return' was aweful. Almost half of the elves perished. All of the valley and its wonders were destroyed. Almost nothing remained. Artifacts and books shattered and burnt alike. The battered elves retreated and begun to wander aimlessly through the lands, until they encountered scouts of the Deraisim who led them to the safety of their woods. At first they were disgusted by the primitive lifestyle of their brethren, but soon they decided they had to guide and lead them back to true values of elvenkind. So one of their encampements was choosen as new home for the elvenkind and the city of Ab'Dendriel was founded.",

        "text": "Nictros and Baeloc Blackwood were the greatest knights of their time. Even in their youth, their exploits have been impressive. The siblings were motivated by their competition towards each other. Whatever one of them achieved, the other tried to outdo. They excelled in the athletic arts and it is said that they surpassed their combat instructors constantly soon after they were replaced by more competent ones. They achieved knighthood in an early age and joined the army in numerous campaigns against the orcs and fought valiantly in the outlaw wars. As times of peace didn't suit them well, they went on daring quests and pitted themselves against some of the most fearsome monsters of the land. They killed the two-sided hydra, the three headed dragon of Cormaya, the ancient vampire of Senja and the abominable beast of Guddenwood. On tourneys they were only bested by each other, with either brother claiming similarly frequent victories. Legend has it that their excellence lead to a great deal of vanity with a hint of cruelty. Though they acquired many admirers, they rarely made friends. Their casual cruelty and insulting arrogance caused wounds and created trenches over the years. But the brothers did not care. It seemed they needed only each other and despised the company or even presence of strangers. According to the laws of those days they had a certain leeway how to handle the affairs of their estates and legend tells that they were cruel masters whose subjects often were left dead or maimed for the slightest failures. The treatment of their subjects lead to many wanting to flee their lands to which the bothers responded with a peculiar death penalty for anyone caught in the act. They did not outright kill them, but made them target of a hunt in which they were chased down without having a true chance to escape. Over the years the number of their enemies and contenders swell. One day when they were on their way home from a victory feast, still halve drunk and spent from their previous battle, they were waylaid by a coalition of their enemies and their forces. Although the brothers fought even long after their whole retinue had been slaughtered, eventually weariness took its toll and one of the brothers slipped on the floor that had long turned into bloody mud. Immediately his opponents were upon him and took his life. The other brother went into a frenzy, fighting like a madman. It is said, he might even have won the battle against all odds had he not in the end allowed his dying foes to stab him, for he lost his reason to live.",

        "text": "The Shiron'Fal is an organization that seems to predate the dawn of mankind. A time of constant strife and warfare gave birth to a fledgling organisation of dishevelled but powerful individuals. The original purpose of this pact was probably as mundane as pooling resources for survival but it soon became something more meaningful and sinister. The first members seem to have been some of the last remnants of their race that perished in the god wars. Each of them brought a unique set of skills and talents that quickly added up in power. With the imminent danger of annihilation averted, the group soon consolidated it's power and reasserted their goals. They were probably genuinely surprised by the success their alliance has had and began to hunger for more. Inspired by the synergy their diversity created, they began to look for individuals of power that could provide something beneficial to the group. Over the centuries the scope of their ambitions broadened. They began not only to acquire new members but also powerful artifacts and minions. All the while they operated in the shadows. Making their hidden moves, manipulating people and events, taking whatever they needed to increase their power. Their agents travelled the world in many forms and disguises, looking for relics and recruits. If a target was identified, a powerful member of the Shiron'Fal made its move with deadly efficiency. What could not be taken by guile was taken by force. For the most parts of history, though, the organisation seemed more like a sleeping giant. Waking up now and then, making some devastating moves, only to vanish into obscurity once again. During the last centuries the actions of the pact have become more consistent and frequent. Why there was this increase in activity is yet to be determined. What can be said, however, is that their process of recruitment has been broadened and now also aims at the most powerful specimens of certain races or supernatural beings. Sometimes the organisation has plotted to pit such individuals against perilous odds to determine their worth.\nIn the most recent history they can be made responsible for events like the discovery of several powerful vampires and the rise of werekin activity on Feyrist. A more personal action of the legion was the presence of one of their members in Rathelton, seeking for an object of power and the attempt to subvert the elven courts of summer and winter to free and recruit or enslave the nightmare beast that was bound by them.\nThe ancient term Shiron'Fal roughly translates in something along the lines of \"dread legion\" or \"army of the last days\". More literal the words translate into \"numerous, military organisation\" and vaguely describe a special time of reckoning. This might give a hint of their ultimate purpose. Some assume all their efforts are aimed at a final battle for all of creation. Others think it rather hints at the ultimate goal to conquer or destroy everything as soon as they accumulated enough power. Some even claim a renewal of the god wars is their ultimate goal.\nYet most about the Shiron'Fal is shrouded in mystery. Even the most basic information like a base of operation, the number of members or even the names from more than a few of them are unknown. Not even the structure of organisation is apparent, although there are strong hints that an enigmatic single entity is in lead of the legion.",

        "text": "The Book of Vile Evil\nA vampire is an impure sinner that in life served the dark gods.\nThrough this connection he is infused with increasingly tainted and dark energy over the course of his existence. In life they do many damnable things for their dark gods, burdening their souls to such an extent that they will most likely rise as ghosts if the dark gods do not claim their souls.\nIn some cases where the soul has been claimed, the hollow spirit still captured within the dead soulless body can utilise the dark energies of the corpse and animate it.\nJust as an undead being is controlled by a necromancer, the vampire is merely a shell controlled by the spirit residing within.\nThe spirit constantly needs to refresh the dark energy he is using up and is in dire need for a substitute for the soul. Additional special circumstances such as holy ground or sunlight amplify the rate in which the dark energies decrease. To substitute this, the vampire is forced to steal the souls of the living.\nThe easiest way for him to accomplish this is by stealing the blood of living humans. The blood normally contains some amount of soul energy, however, a vampire is able to force more soul energy into it's victims blood while feeding.\nIn his own dead shell the vampire transforms the stolen soul energy into new dark energy. This process keeps him in existence. Over the years, the entire body only consists of dark energy residue and slowly turns into a shadow with substance.\nIf the vampiric body is destroyed, the spirit within becomes entrapped in the remains. Helpless it is cursed to wait for enough dark energy to accumulate in order to be able to recreate the shadow body in some way. Given time and sacrifices, a vampire might slowly rise from the state of apparent destruction to once again haunt the mortals.\nAnother possibility is that the remains are close to some source of dark power, giving off enough pure dark energy to occasionally haunt the dreams of the living or to form a ghostly body to steal the life breath of sleepers in the vicinity of the vampires' corpse. This process might take longer but will still lead to the vampires' resurrection.\nThe only way to irrevocably destroy a vampire is a blessed stake. The stake will destroy the evil spirits' ties to our world and send it into hell screaming.",

I dared not to breath, the glance of the mummy seemed to stain my soul with rot and evil. I heaed my heart beating. Then the mummy slowly lifted its arm, pointed at us and spoke 'chamek ath uthul arak!' The priest of Fardos who was with us and survived that nighmarish ordeal later told us it means 'sacrifice your blood' in some ancient language of an extinct race. Of course we did not know how to react and noone would have given this godscursed creature even the dirt under our fingernails anyways. After a moment of silence the mummy raised its hands again and with anger yelled but one word: 'Kadash!' I did not need a linguist to translated that. It meant 'attack'. And within the next heartbeat the screaming horde stormed us, ready to flail our living flesh from our bones ...",

Forged with a technique\nforgotten long ago,  and imbued with\nmagic so that they would stand the test\nof both time and war,  these shields\nof the mastermind were prized among\ncollectors- but even more among warriors.\nOne particular shield, passing from\nhand to hand,  ended up in the\npossession of an intrepid explorer.\nWith it in his hand he delved\ndeeper than he ever would have before,\nwith no fear now with this great\nartifact to protect him.  And soon\nhe learned (although it was a brief\nlesson) that even the best shield won't\nsave you from everything.\nAn ancient,  cast out by the gods for\nbetraying the powers granted him,\nfound a rift through which he could\nre-enter our plane of existence.\nTwisted and forsaken,  he strode\nthrough the tunnels and lava deep\nbeneath the earth,  killing those\nwho did not succumb to his will\nimmediately.  Our intrepid\nadventurer being a good example\nof one who took the more painful\nof those options.  The demon was\nnow armed with one of the greatest\npieces of corporeal protection this\nworld has ever known.  And despite\nthat,  he too fell in arrogance.\nThus the shield passed to his\ndestroyer,  a mage of extraordinary\npower.  This mage was known\nfor her discoveries and\naccomplishments, as well as her\nno-nonsense disposition.\nRealizing the shield would be of\nbetter use in hands other than her\nown,  she graciously passed\nownership (temporarily) to one of\nher friends.  Some say this is the\nonly thing that saved her life from\nthe same fate that befell the\nshield's previous owners.",

        "text": "We confirm that the Ruthless Seven have occupied the place which is known as Pits of Inferno. With the help of divination, we were able to see that they channelled their dark essence to some remote place in our world for unknown reasons. We could not figure out this place, though. It cannot be emphasised enough that it is extremely important to find this place and if possible, to destroy it.\nIt is certain that the gate from our world to the demon realm, which is situated somewhere in the pits, is currently inactive. It works similar like a volcano. Sometimes there is some activity there, most of the time nothing happens at all, but occasionally there is a tremendous eruption.\nWe assume that the last major eruption coincided with the destruction of the Nightmare Knights. Several earlier reports of increased demonic activity overlap with eruptions, too.\nThree things can be concluded from our observations: Firstly, the demons have no control over these eruptions, though they try to be as active as possible whenever an eruption occurs.\nSecondly, the demons cannot foresee the dates of these eruptions. For this reason, coordinated efforts to make use of the eruptions are delayed.\nThirdly, eruptions are not stable enough to support a longer campaign without risking the stranding of many powerful demons in our world like fish on dry land.\nThe worst thing that could happen is that a large amount of less powerful demons is breaching into our world to stay here permanently. They will have some guidance by their leaders as long as the eruption lasts. Once the eruption comes to an end, the demonic leaders will retreat to their realm, leaving a chaotic and rampaging demon army in our world.\nAs long as the pits were defended by the Nightmare Knights, who must have known previously when an eruption would occur, the demons could be fought back while they were still materialising and thus, most vulnerable. Now that the pits are lost and overrun by demonic hordes, an attack becomes more and more likely.\nThere was no massive demonic invasion in the past, and probably there won't by any in the future. If the demons had had such a possibility, they would have used it. At least some archdemons would have grabbed the chance, and a cabal such as the Ruthless Seven surely has the power to attack our world while defending its position in its own realm. It is surely no lack of ambition that keeps the demons from raiding us, there must be other forces that have prevented such an attack so far.\nEven before the creation of the humans, there have been several occurrences that can only be interpreted as attacks by demonic armies trying to stop the creation process. Inhuman sources tell of several armies that invaded our world in the course of many centuries.\nMost of these invasions could be tracked to some unholy centre of magic. From there immense forces were evoked to open a gate through which the demonic armies entered our world.\nThe gate was opened, an army passed through, and the gate eventually closed again. The invading armies had no supplies and were finally destroyed. The demonic leaders made only rare appearances on the battlefield, probably summoned by their minions for a while. So contrary to common belief, it seems possible that a large demonic army enters our world if certain conditions are met. It should be our top priority to find out what conditions this may be.",

He had seen the frost coming already from a good distance but he did not flee. Instead he took out his lute and started to play a lovely and solemn tune. The frost, who was quite tired from his long walk, could not resist and fell asleep. Quickly Marl put his hand into the frost's chest and stole his heart. With the heart in his hands, Marl also had the powers of the frost. So he constructed himself a palace completely made of ice and ruled over a land where every day was spring. As the the neighbouring king heard about this, he got envious and decided to invade the kingdom of Marl with his army. But Marl's people were peaceful and were not trained in any fighting. So the army reached the castle of Marl almost unchallenged. And Marl came out of the castle, pleading the army to leave. But they laughed at him and demanded his surrender. Then Marl took the frost's heart and threw it to the ground where it shattered. In that very moment everything on both realms was frozen with a thick layer of ice and each and everyone died. And the frost returned to power, but without a heart he was even more merciless than before.",

May all witches burn in the eternal hellfires. Though, there is no time for recreation; this witch was not the one I was looking for. Another disappointment in a long row. But I will stay strong - No, I must be strong! For the king and for the well-being of mankind...\nDay 35: That foul creature! It was not her, she must have bewitched me and my guards. When the one which we mistook for the witch burned at the stake the enchantment fell off. Another innocent, murdered by that evil hag.\nDay 36: Now I am sure, she must be in possession of the unholy formula that allows godless minions of Zathroth to fortify their physical and magical powers by brewing a potion out of God-fearing people. She managed once again to escape. We impaled four members of her circle in Carlin, but she managed to escape from a twofold guarded cell. The queen was very ...displeased about the death of four of her citizens. I doubt she would have said a word if it had been men.\nDay 40: Finally! I found out her name! It is Wyda. I will hunt her down, I swear. And when I caught her I will be the only one in possession of the secret formula...\nDay 45: We followed her to the region of the femur hills. I do not have the impression she is fleeing, she rather seems to hurry to reach some specific place - if I only knew where and why.\nDay 46: I managed to get my best scouts in front of her to set up an ambush. This will be the day of my greatest victory. The fame for the inquisition, the defeat for Zathroth's minions... and the secret formula for ME! I will be the mightiest of all priestlords!",

Unspectacular and not sentient on their own, they are mere tools for powerful magicians. There are rumours, though, of ancient feathers that copied so many arcane texts, that some of the knowledge gradually accumulated in them. Slowly but steadily they grow in power and sentience. Eventually they acquired some sort of self awareness. Becoming less of a tool and more of a being, they grew less useful for their original purpose. At some point they are pulled from their copy duties and act more like librarians. Their main function becomes to contain dangerous knowledge with the use of their acquired skills in glyphs and wards. Still they are obsessed with their original purpose and copy random books in their spare time, accumulating more and more knowledge in the process. They are highly skilled in the use of arcane sigils but in the time of need and urgency they rather employ spontaneous bursts of the magic they acquired. Even when protecting themselves or their libraries, they still act more like emotionless constructs reacting on a more practical base. Their fighting style might also best be described as 'efficient'. It takes an extremely long time for an animated feather to display some kind of personality. Most perish to the teeth of time and accidents. The few that endure can become quite intelligent, even quirky. Rumour has it, that a few feathers authored books on their own, not even just compiled knowledge they acquired but genuinely new and creative works with astounding insights. At least one extremely old animated feather chose to author books of comedic limericks while another specialized on acclaimed love poems.",

        "text": "Energetic books were originally a race of shapechanging demons that planned to infiltrate Zathroth's hidden hoard of knowledge to steal enough of it to topple the demon princes and rule on their own. Cunning and knowledgeable they snuck their way through wards and wardens. With trickery and their shapeshifting powers they wormed their way into the heart of secrets. The knowledge they coveted so much was almost at their grasp. Though Zathroth might have seen the effort as admirable, their plot was revealed by his librarians and ultimately thwarted. Before they could finalise their coup, they were cornered, revealed and overpowered. Desperately they made a plea they were doing only Zathroth's work and therefore were not guilty but only zealous, for all they wished for was power through secret knowledge. It is said that the god himself spoke the final verdict on the fiends and forced them into the form of the books they tried to steal. He also bound them to the service of his librarians and to aid them through all eternity. The demons not only retained their original power but indeed were somewhat alleviated by the transformation. So in some way the dark god might have granted them a part of their wish. In the eons since then some aspiring spellwielders managed to summon and bind a few of the energetic books to their will. Most of them are said to be still bound to the holy places of Zathroth, serving as guardians, messengers and even power sources for certain twisted experiments. Little of their ambitious egos remained after all the centuries of servitude. All that's left of them is eagerness to see others suffer too. Their numbers might have declined over the centuries but still there are many of the once proud race around, disgraced, enslaved and with the hatred of centuries to be unleashed on any foolhardy creature they might be sent after.",

        "text": "The brain squids are one of the upper castes of the squid race. Since they are also the most often encountered outside of their home territory, the whole telepathic race has often mistakenly been coined as brain squids. Their purpose is to form a telepathic network that processes information and commands for others of their race. The exchange between individuals intensifies due to proximity and if enough brain squids are close enough to each other, they become a collective entity that overrides each individual. The thoughts of other, 'lesser' members of their species in the vicinity are shut down and they only function as mere extensions and tools of the collective. With the help of the luminous squid cast, they are even able to control the minds of weak willed individuals of other species and make them do their bidding. Like others of their race, they follow the teaching of Zathroth in their own, twisted ways and can sometimes be found amongst other followers of their god. Whether they serve as spies, watchmen or advisors is hard to tell. It is them who create the extreme breeding programmes of their species. If the need arises they come up with a new caste to fit into any new position and initiate the breeding processes that might require much time and many generations to come to pass. This makes the race as a whole somewhat inflexible and dependent on allies. Their inbreed disdain for other races that follow no breeding procedures at all makes it hard for them to find any allies. This lead to their sorcerer class to form pacts with demons and heavy reliance on the assistance by the cult of Zathroth. In turn they provide the cult with capable overseers and fighters, when the need arises and it is said that if that is the case, there is secret breed at their disposal which could prove devastating to their opponents or enemies of Zathroth.",

Seekers and preservers of knowledge to the core of their very essence is bound to the principles of Uman-Zathroth. The energuardians are extremely intelligent, with several independent brain spheres that by choice can work separately or in unison. They are constantly occupied with several projects at once and only a few spheres of them sleep at the same time. Even in face of mortal threat they are usually distracted by 'more urgent' matters. Still dangerous and powerful, it's hard to tell what potential an energuardian could unleash, if he'd ever focussed on a single issue like a fight.\nThough in general very reasonable, the energuardians are also devout followers of Zathroth and very strict in heeding their obligations. They are aware of their status, power and knowledge and behave extremely arrogant and dismissive towards other races and underlings.\nEach of them possesses a unique personal book that is no book at all but rather a scrying device which can display the contents of any other book it memorised and access books stored in the personal book of another energuardian within a certain radius. Each of those books is connected to the books of each other guardian and through willpower they can send written messages to the books of other energuardians. This form of communication has become so popular to their kind, that it completely replaced spoken language within their whole race. Only reluctantly they use their underdeveloped speech organs to communicate with lesser creatures.",

        "text": "Most icecold books are creations of a long gone race of cryomancers. This race casted their spells always with the books as conduit and amplifier. Therefore they bound powerful spirits of frost and ice into their tomes. The levitating books accompanied them as companions and tools at once. With the vanishing of their creator race, the icecold books became inert. Hungry for the knowledge contained in them, they were stolen and experimented upon. The only way found to unleash their considerable power, was to empower them with a will of their own and bind certain arcane crystals attuned to icemagic into them as an energy source. Thus the books became self-sustained entities that had access to at least some of the ancient spells bound to them. They follow an icecold, yet somewhat malignant logic and can be reasoned with to some degree. Since their creators seemed to have had some deeper connection to Zathroth, they easily ally with his forces. Still they act on their own and might behave strongly unpredictable. Almost indistinguishable from them are newer creations that were attempts to recreate them with modern magic. Though less powerful and less intelligent, these copies are highly obedient to their creators but contain no bound knowledge on their own. Instead they use an array of frost abilities that work more with a brute force method than artfully woven magic like the originals. They are used to provide a reliable source of ice magic, that doesn't drain the mana reserves of its owner. Both versions can be found as status symbols of powerful casters. It is said that a high number of originals was collected and stored away by followers of Zathroth but even they were unable to unlock the final secret knowledge contained in them.",

This lead to an extreme specialised cast-like system in which the squid warden served as a kind of police force. Favouring secret knowledge as source of power, they follow a complex set of rules and laws that are not commonly known. They are often found patrolling extremely important and holy places dedicated to Zathroth and his principles. Bread as enforcers they have a formidable array of offensive powers, can not be bribed and hardly reasoned with. They seamlessly blend magic and their natural telepathy with frightening efficiency and seem impervious to pain thanks to their willpower. Due to their for outsiders incomprehensible behavior patters that follow their own secret rules, they are not well-liked by other Zathroth worshipers.\nThe higher ranks in the cult, however, employ them nonetheless and willingly accept a few casualties in the own ranks when someone breaks the unspoken rules of the wardens. Though able to communicate with others than their own race, they almost never lower themselves to argue with or explain themselves to other creatures, which they see only with contempt. Way more than others of their kind, they see other races not following purposeful breeding cycles, as random abominations that should be eradicated. They have an unexplainable weakness for music though and sometimes can be soothed by it. The kind of music the squid warden fancies however, would be considered cacophonic by other beings, so finding the 'right tune' to please them is rather impossible.",

Some works become like entities on their own and begin to feed on the energy of their creator.\nSometimes they consume even more energy than a mere arcane book can contain. Such overloaded books begin to 'bleed' out some of the lifeblood and essence they contain in the form of magic ink. While a single book can merely produce some inconsequential droplets of soul-ink, a large number of books that provide such ink might pool into a greater blob.This combined essence quickly gains a form of sentience of their own and feeds on lesser pools to grow in size and power.\nSince they become very protective towards the books that spawned them and they still feel some kind of mystical connection to. they are usually rather seen as useful than just a mere nuisance, though they are always quite hostile towards strangers.\nSince in theory they can absorb unlimited amounts of essence pools and grow to abominably sizes, they are commonly culled by the keepers of the libraries that spawn them and split into lesser, better manageable blobs of smaller size. The refreshment of fading inks in old books, destruction of vermin as well as mold and keeping the pages at the ideal state of dryness counts to their more usual functions. They tend scare away some nosy intruders and keep visitors out of areas they are unwanted in. While relatively 'newborn' ink blobs are timid and react to strangers with scary faces and bubbly noises older, more experienced blobs, become considerably more aware of their own capabilities and grow more and more aggressive and malignant.",

Most such misfortunes lead to the untimely death of the vain caster in spectacular fashion, sometimes, however, it happens that some lesser demon is partly summoned and melts into the book containing the spell by absorbing the life force of the unfortunate reader. Such demon-book conglomerates can become enormously powerful by harnessing the knowledge contained in the book, demonic forces and whatever might be left of the casters memories and fractured soul. For their raw power and potential but also for their contained knowledge, such cursed books are hunted down by Zathroths librarians and bookkeepers and dragged away to some sinister place of forbidden knowledge. There they are trained, their skills honed and they become part of Zathroth's collection and serve as his guardian dogs to protect other secrets. Perhaps because of the way of their unwilling creation, cursed books feel nothing but spite, contempt and hatred against living beings. Sometimes they even plot to incite mortals to follow their own foolishness and use spells beyond their power. Whether they do so to create more of their kind or just to enjoy the misery of others can't be told for sure. Most of them just skip such subtlety and attack anything not allied to them or their masters with all of the raw power available to them.",

My beloved leather boots were missing and the biting cold of the black marble floor crawled up my legs, which gave me back some lucidity.\nFirmly, I held sword and shield in my calloused hands and wandered as if carried by an omnipotent force or instinct. The legs took my body by themselves seeking the unknown reason of my discomfort. Went north until I saw a strangely familiar dungeon. Torch ignited, carefully entered the hostile cave. Putrid air filled my lums. Howls, grunts and screams echoed through the cold, damp stone walls. I've walked those paths for hours finding nothing and the torch, slowly, fading.\nAround a corner, I witness a grotesque scene whose invoked my most primordial fears. My head boiled again and in an involuntary reflex I gritted my teeth. The beast that was feeding on the deceased man noticed and attacked me. \"KAPLAR!\" shout the half-human, half-bovine. A nature's nefarious breed. Fear, disgust and anger fulfilled my mind. A bullseyed stomp cracked the shield and made me hit backwards against a wall. He thumped his hooves on the ground and rushed to the final blow. Instinctively, I moved a few inches causing him to thrust his sharp horns into the stone walls. My sword found a space between two of his ribs and I felt it vibrating at the touch of the heart that still beated few times before no more.\nRelieved, I looted the monster and went to the deceased man. \"He's dead anyway\", I though and turned his body towards me.\nMy head exploded in excruciating pain. I closed my eyes and screamed loudly and kneeling on agony! Eyelids opened, I saw myself still screaming, but through the dead's eyes! He was me!\nThe desperate cry echoed through the walls. Suddenly, I felt a small tremor. A horde approached! Back to myself, I was ready to protect my remains and old boots at all costs. Torches appeared on the corner. In front of the pack, a similar creature, but wearing a purple robe, a wand and followed by hyenas. White flash.\nOnce comforting words of Cipfried had little impact on my mind this time. Briefly a strong headache blurred my sight. Confused, I looked around. Now, completely naked.",

        "text": "Roshamuul Exploring\nI was an Elite Knight, promoted by King Tibianus himself, and I was given the task to explore the new island called Roshamuul and report my findings. I was the leader of a group known to always prevail and never surrender, so we were the obvious choice for the job.\nAfter months of hard work and lots of lives lost, my team was able to build the Roshamuul bridge. Little did we know what dangers were expecting us ahead. We were afraid, but our will to uncover the secrets of this new and dangerous place prevailed and in no time a group of the best warriors discovered a seemingly impenetrable wall, deep inside the valley.\nI was leading that group, and with the healing power of two of the finest druids in the realm, I was able to advance to the east, arriving in a gruesome cemetery with Guzzlemaws hiding behind every corner. We discovered piles of bones containing some special horns, which had magical properties - blowing on them started weakening the great Roshamuul wall. We left the valley that day feeling that real progress was being made, and back on the main camp we told everyone about our discoveries.\nThe next day, I sent some powerful man to protect the wall surroundings, and went straight to the eastern part of the valley - but I felt something was wrong right away. I didn't know what it was, but I felt a shiver down my spine the moment I entered the cemetery. There weren't many creatures there, only a few hiding in the bone piles. There was an unnatural silence, like even the dreadful creatures there were afraid of something.\nThat is when I heard a scream: a mage in the back was lying dead on the ground, crushed by a stone. Behind him was an enormous creature, heavily armored and with a single huge eye. I told my party members to stand ground, but more of the creatures started showing from every direction, until we were overwhelmed. I was able to block four of them, but everyone panicked and just fled - they finally surrendered. As I was dying, the only thing I could think of was my failure and how reckless I was.\nAs the time passed by, my name was forgotten, but the creature's name was immortalized as the Sight of Surrender.",

The walls made from pure iron ore, here I was in the middle of the dwarf mines.\nThe ground shook from up above, I had to move fast to remain unseen. I had one mission and one mission only, to find a dwarven pick axe. Ive been searching for this pickaxe for months so I could finally join the ranks of the explorerer society.\nThe deeper I went into the mines, the more I was less certain I would ever make it back to see the light of day.\nI dropped down a hole, there it was, a dwarven pickaxe. It was all to easy, as I held it within my grip, I have finally recovered it.\nVictory....... I thought.\nThen from behind me, a blunt object resembling the shape of a hammer struck me in the back. I fell to my knees.\nThey must have seen me coming. This is an ambush.\nI managed to get to my feet, as well as get a firm grip on my fire sword, I pierced through the dwarfs armor and struck him through the heart, killing him instantly.\nThe battle was not done yet. I used my dusty rope and climbed out of this hole, only to find a small army of dwarves who were waiting for me. I begged them to let me pass, but they would not agree.\nGripping my Sword I struck them down one by one. Until there were no more. To this day, that has been the hardest battle I have ever encountered. I did it.\nI survived.\nI could barely walk. with my fire sword sheathed I picked up my prize. The pickaxe.\nWalking out of there, the minutes felt like days. Blood and sweat dripped onto my brow from underneath my helmet.\nThere it was. The light. I made it.\nFrom out of nowhere, a crossbow bolt come whistling out of the air and pierces me through the torso. I fall to my knees. This is the end.\nAll I can do now is thank the gods for bringing me back. One day I will return, and reclaim what is mine.",

        "text": "The Inexperienced Human\nby Cipfried\nThe behaviour of the inexperienced human truly is a marvel to behold. It is only moments after being welcomed into this exciting world of ours that the inexperienced human deems himself ready to hunt his first prey. Anxious to shed blood, the inexperienced human completely abandons all semblance of common sense and immediately goes rushing towards the sewers below our little village, intending to slay some of the rodents residing there. \"Those puny rats... ha!\" the inexperienced human scoffs. \"What chance could such tiny creatures possibly stand against a handsome and able-bodied fellow such as myself?\" Little does the inexperienced human know what awaits him on the other side of that sewer grate, however, and it is not long before it becomes abundantly clear that the first of his many follies was that of not bringing a torch to illuminate the path before him. Lacking the intelligence to understand when to retreat, the inexperienced human instead starts feeling his way deeper and deeper into the pitch-black cave until eventually stumbling upon a crossroads of sorts. \"In which direction shall I head now?\" the inexperienced human asks himself indecisively, but oh no, what's that? Have the rats which the inexperienced human was so eager to find cruelly taken advantage of his minor act of hesitation by cornering him? It would appear so, dear readers, and now consider closely the inexperienced human's reaction. Trapped and struggling to land satisfactory blows on his hairy enemies, the inexperienced human's first instinct is to accuse his weapon of conspiring against him. His second, after realising that his relentless opponents are inflicting considerable damage on his ankles, is to descend into utter despair. \"Whatever have I done to deserve this grim fate?\" the inexperienced human cries out to our benevolent gods. Wallowing in self-pity and drained of all willpower, the inexperienced human ultimately yields to his adversaries with a broken spirit. Death being inevitable by this point, I am never surprised to see members of this foolish species appear beside me once again.",

YOU CANNOT BREAK ME. I AM PERPETUAL.\nI wanted to prove them wrong. I WAS going to break them, take their destiny and make it mine. How ambitious I was.\nI found myself near a well, hands bloodied, stamina drained, the need for rest took over my thought process and I made the trip down. As my muscles grew relaxed, and eyelids started to close, I felt a small sting on my abdomen, causing me to quickly turn around.\nA lowly, single, scorpion.

I could've not be perceived as weak. I'd rather let it all end. Prideful as ever, I was.\nMy voice was the first to give in.\nMy Vision followed suit, not shortly after.\nAnd as my lounges stopped working, I clenched the letter in my hand as my life fade from me.

        "text": "The Tricked Trickster\nOnce upon a time, in the long-forgotten lands of Nova, there was a young and promising sorceress. While very cunning, her yearning for riches often got her in trouble. She got expelled from the Ivory Towers of Edron following the disappearance of several wondrous artifacts. Penniless, the teen rascal got to Thais as a stowaway. She devised a series of swindles that allowed her to hold up, although it was never enough. She was infatuated with legendary treasures brought to Thais by merchants, recovered from the deepest dungeons of Tibia.\nNecessity is often the mother of invention, and so she brought forth her master heist. All it took was a wealthy adventurer, a dark alley, and her vile wits. The sorceress would boost the unwary hero's ego with flattery. Then she would ask the adventurer to show his belongings, ideally the most prodigal item of his arsenal. Next, she would summon mystical fires to engulf the treasures. The heroes would be startled, unable to reach their belongings, now buried by flames. Killing her was often discarded by the victims, doing so in the middle of the city was often a bad idea. Removing the flames required a specific rune spell, one that most did not carry with them. She was obviously in possession of the rune, so the witty thief only had to hide, wait for the victims to run for help and collect the treasures. Dozens fell for the trick and soon enough she got quite rich.\nThis success got the attention of other thieves, as well as praise amongst her fellow bandits. One of them, nicknamed \"Thunderfingers\", dared the now prideful sorceress to bet on her most valuable possession in a contest for speed. She accepted right away. The most infamous thieves of Thais met in a dark street as witnesses. Both contestants betted on a demon helmet, a rarity stolen from the depths of Hell. The idea was to place it in a pedestal between the challengers. The quickest to retrieve it would be the winner.\nThe sorceress was ready, confident, and placed the helmet on the pillar with ceremony. Immediately after, a torrent of dark magic struck her. The last thing she saw before the gods claimed her wicked soul was \"Thunderfingers\" grinning at his accomplices. As she passed, she understood that he never intended to play fair. Just like she ever did.",

        "text": "A page of Goshnars manifest: \nAs shown, in theory there are many ways to imbue a dead creature with immense power (see chapters 22 to 24). When one combines sorcerous and spiritual means the result should be extraordinary. The idea here is, that you can use sorcery to turn a suitable being into a lich-like being under your control (see lich-thralls, chapter 15). If such a creature is already imbued with some kind of spirituality (that is: in the process of ascending, as shown in chapter 7) both powers would add up. While this is a neat little parlour trick, it's more for prestige then for power, since the subject, though formidable, won't be able to access its spiritual potential at all. Here is the catch, however. Due to the law of transcended identity, several such creatures could be used to focus their powers into a higher, slightly more spiritually potent being of the same kind. In layman's terms you could say, you bundle their power into one recipient. If this bundled power reaches a certain threshold, the metaphysical adaption actually burns a new spiritual power level into the recipient. We have seen such acts in which mass sacrifices of fanatic cult followers helped certain leaders to ascend to some degree. For the purposes of necromancy it means we could easily bundle the power of several lesser undead into one of greater power. Now this comes with several problems though. Raw power isn't transferred well. It simply overrides former power levels. So while you could create one decent zombie by sacrificing a hoard of zombies, it would still be a zombie, fragile and weak. The sorcerous levels at least somewhat add up. So if you create several lich-thralls (see chapter 15) you can combine them into one with more sorcerous power than the individuals have. Now the spirituality comes into play. The spiritual level is in reality a level of ascension (see chapter 7). The problem is, normal ascension is bound to the soul rather than to the body. Since we have created lich-thralls, we have no real souls at our disposal but are dealing with false-souls (see chapter 13). They lack any level of spirituality at all. Yet there is a way the ascension is residual in a dead body, when said person was immensely revered or feared in life. This non-native ascension isn't inherent to the soul but to the person of the recipient, in this case the bodily remains. So a person that was revered in life has some remainder of ascension left in the body. If it was famous and well-remembered the energy lingers on for longer. This leads to the possibility of creating lich-thralls based on heroes of legend. While a single one would have only the powers as to be expected from such a creature, you can now combine them into another, greater hero (a transfer to a lesser level of ascension would simply not work). With the fusion of spirituality in this creature, a new level of ascension would be created. Mind you, it's not a true ascension and although there is an immense increase in personal power, it's actually just tricking some laws of nature. A true and ultimate ascension is not possible by such means. But for the purpose of a potentially immensely powerful thrall, this is ideal of course. However you will need quite a lot of such semi ascended heroes. Experiments showed that the critical mass for the ascension fusion is rather high. Too many sources, however, create an incompatibility loop, that usually destroys all subjects involved. So you have to aim at a decent number of properly powerfully imbued individuals. Even with great heroes you need at least four sources and things start to go awry at about 12 individual sources. The sweet spot seems to be using 7 subjects. That lowers the possibility of the fusion and introduces negative effects due to incompatilities.",

Our real names long forgotten, we hide more often than we show ourselves.\nOf course this does not apply to the initiates. Oh how I wish I could live that life again - or better, not to make that choice from the beginning. We all had a choice, yes. The scriptorum does not ask certain questions lightly. Yet, you want to know - strife... to know. We all did. All of us who wanted to know the truth - and don't they all.\nYou're not at all ready for this as an initiate, true. You could go all the way, ask them for a hint - beg them even. They know what happens to you if you're not prepared. The Scriptorum knows. I do, too.\nNow I am part of it. Trying to get to the bottom of it, unraveling secret after secret. Solving puzzles piece by piece. And then you see that you never wanted to. You can't apprehend or comprehend, you struggle. You want to scrape certain thoughts out of your head. There is no way. Not like that. It is not that simple. Then you clinging on to the idea to protect others from this truth, this twisted epiphany. It becomes your motto, your mantra. You suppress the thoughts, put all your energy in the veil, the Planegazers. Covering everything. Your every step and your very existence.\nYet our ranks grow, more and more become aware that there is something else, something behind certain things. I know that feeling. Like someone is watching, controlling you. An urge to find what's behind this or that, you see signs, omens - you just want to know. There is no way but to let certain individuals join - to channel their curiosity and to stay in control. To ultimately protect them as well.\n'Veil the truth' they say 'canvas your knowledge'. And do you know why, do you... want to know why? They are afraid! We all are! Anxiety is driving us, trying to take control and plunge us into madness.\nSo we conceived ourselves. We 'became' wisdom the very same moment we became shadows. And for what! To hide it from others. From the world, everything.\nUndoubtedly you, who reads this is seeking knowledge as well. Wisdom. Enlightenment from old words and dusty tomes in dark corners. I see myself, reading this right now. If I could go back in time I would use this chance to tell my younger eager self just one simple truth:\nUncovering something is only one side of the coin, dealing with this knowledge can be a whole other dimension.",

One passage reads:\n\"...what seems to be the very first of many mysterious chests. We tried everything to open it. But it refuses to spill its secrets. My assistants suggested to request advice from the council. Secretive and hesitant as they are, they suggested not to proceed until we know more about what we're dealing with.\"\nAnother illegible passage is followed by:\n\"...we shall never find him if we continue hiding in the shadows, prying old rubble and dusty tomes. My own plan was deemed too radical an approach. Instead, the council recommended to erect a chamber of knowledge around this recent discovery. My group was commanded to guard the chest and to\nhide its existence like we did with all our recent findings. Me? A mere custodian of what might have been the missing part to a puzzle I spent a lifetime of research on? obey. We will guard it and keep it secret. But know that the creature never sleeps, never rests and never falters. Ever walking the planes he is bound to arrive here sooner or later. What the council fails to understand is that this is not and has never been a chase, it's an assault on our very existence.\"",

And now I am here! Here to dig up my first real treasure, maybe even more! My very own discovery of a tomb or even a lost palace! No - an archeological breakthrough (let's just say that not all of the gold and riches could be recovered), I will document everything I find in this diary!\n\nDay 237\n\nWell, I started digging. It's a tedious task, not to speak of the dirt, dust, mud and all kinds of roots in your face while you barely scrape the surface on what feels like granite. Nothing interesting so far, but such a discovery is not to be made in a day's work.\n\nDay 238\n\nStill digging. It, well, still looks like a huge wall. I actually uncovered a lot of it but there seems to be no entrance. Anyway, I got to continue.\n\nDay 239\n\nDigging. Not a single trace of any door or even a window. Maybe home of some obscure cult of darkness? Maybe creatures of the night? A hideout for ghouls? Maybe I am working not hard enough. Hm, there seems to be a strange spot there at the wall, I can see it clearly from here. I shall try to push or pull it right away! Fame and riches, here I come!\n\nDay 241, 242?\n\nTurns out I was hit by some stone while pulling a brick out of the wall that was in fact not even part of the wall. Seems I was out for a day... or two? I'm actually quite hungry and there is still no sign of any entrance. Maybe one more day of work, I am sure I can dig up... SOMETHING.\n\nDay 243 (probably)\n\nThere is a small drift coming out of the wall, around the middle section of the large chunk I uncovered. Maybe someone actually bricked the whole entrance up to hinder something from entering - or getting out? I am exhausted and hungry and I have no interest in that whole treasure hunting archeology business. I can't even concentrate anymore. Where did I put my pick again? I hope I don't forget to take my diary with me. Anyway, I'm out of here.",

The council has sealed off most of the sites by now. We are trying to gather enough information from this one to be able to move on. Unfortunately, most of the useful equipment has already been withdrawn, right after decoding (the following paragraph looks as if it has been hastily effaced). We are basically working with sticks and stones here.\nI will file a report concerning recent regulation changes and the conditions under which we have to operate. My complaints will be sent to the council as soon as we leave this post. Our mission is indeed clear, secrecy is highly advised. However, right now all this does is to hinder our progress. I am beginning to think there is something more at work here. Why are so many sites closed in a hurry, why does it seem the council nowaddays confuses giving advice with issuing orders, and caution with secret-mongering? I shall keep these thoughts to myself. All those doubts may unsettle my colleagues and that would be nothing but counterproductive.\nOur detailed findings have been recorded (note: Compendium Site XIV). The state of the forge is operational. On a more personal note I want to express my concerns concerning our current situation. We all know the directive in case of an 'Erasure', which will undoubtedly be upon us in a matter of days. However, our time window is far too narrow. While most of the equipment is already off site (compare with my notes from the first paragraph), I highly doubt we will be able to move the forge itself in time. We have gathered all remaining devices from this site and can only hope that all other teams have followed the directive to the letter. Should an outsider come into the possession of a leftover device, with the forge still active I cannot guarantee that this individual can be kept from deciphering what we found. Mechanical contraptions will advance over time and nothing will be safe. We shall heed our principle for we are without guide if we do not.

While many nagas can only perform yukti with two arms at the same time, some are able to form these gestures with three or even all four hands simultaneously. They are more powerful because they can combine more yukti at the same time to cast more powerful spells.\n\nThe solid water is a secret only known to the naga. It has roundish, organic shapes, like waves that have solidified in motion. It can also take the appearance of large drops or water bubbles. The solid water is very receptive to magical energy and therefore often enchanted. In the past, at the beginning of the Rising, these elements were mainly used to push back the water by casting repulsion spells on them. For now, they are used for a wide variety of purposes, partly to direct and guide water and to collect it in certain places, but also for entirely different purposes. And sometimes the solid water is only used for aesthetic decoration.",

She always stood high in the sky, looking down on us benevolently and lighting up the nights. Although we love the warmth of the sun, it is the moon that moves the sea, creating the tides. It is the moon that can charge solid water with energy. That strengthens our magical powers. We think of the moon as a queen and the stars as her many maids. But once, in her wanderings across the night sky, Amati took a misstep and fell. She plummeted down, right above Marapur and landed in the Stardance Mountains. Hurt and alone, she didn't know how to get back up into the sky. And the stars missed her bitterly. Moon and stars shed many tears and mourned many nights - dark nights, without Amati's light in the sky. But then the stars decided to do something they had never done before: they descended from the sky and surrounded the fallen moon. They began a magical dance. And lo and behold, Amati was healed and, with the help of the stars, she was able to rise into the sky again. This is why the mountains in the center of Marapur are called the Stardance Mountains and our city here Moonfall. For it was at this very spot that Amati had fallen.",

They know everything about the tidal currents and can reliably predict when it is safe to navigate the sea with the small naga boats. They know when schools of fish come close to the coasts, making it a good time for fish. And they can estimate which islands will be affected by the Rising soon. The wave shapers are a kind of water-magicians who can create solid water, charge it with magic and also transform it into other forms. They have a sort of water-empathy that allows them to solidify the water and then shape it as if it were soft wax. Another profession is that of beaver whisperers. The nagas use the island's giant beavers as beasts of burden to transport timbers, star leaf and other material. These beavers are taken care of by the beaver whisperers, who build a trusting relationship with the animals and thus get them to work for the nagas.",

        "text": "About naga families, a treatise by Ziyad\n\nNagas do not know family in the sense how humans and many other peoples define it. Female naga lay eggs, but they do not take care of them themselves. Instead, they give them to larger nests for breeding. There, brood helpers take care of the eggs and also of the small nagas when they hatch. Nagas become independent quite quickly and reach the stage of a somewhat six-year-old human child after only one year. Then they are sent back to their parents, who take care of their education - or to one of the parents in case they are no longer in a relationship. Which happens quite often, because nagas rarely form longer, monogamous relationships. Hence, I assume, the displeasure about the intended marriage of Candra and Nihaka, which by many is dismissed as the crazy idea of two teenagers - and with someone from the \"other\" culture at that.\nAnother interesting fact about nagas is, that they sleep either in large, padded round baskets or by curling their snake bodies around thick branches. These very different ways of sleeping can be a source of discussion among naga couples when \"branch sleepers\" meet \"basket sleepers\".",

        "text": "Creatures of Marapur\n\nParder\n\nThe parder is a wild cat inhabiting the jungle-covered isles of Marapur. Its fur is of a dark ochreous ground-color, obliterated by a dark-brown blotted pattern on legs and flanks. A dark stripe also runs from the head across the neck and back. Parders are good climbers, but due to the omnipresence of water they have also developed into good swimmers and like to catch fish. For the nagas, the medium-sized predatory cats hardly pose a threat. They do, however, prey on humanoid bipeds.\n\nMoa\n\nMoas are large birds with striking, colorful plumage that live on the jungle-covered island of Marapur. Because of their strong legs, with which they can move quickly on land, one might think that moas are incapable of flight. In fact, however, they are good flyers and prefer to build their nests in the high mountainous areas of the island. Moas are herbivores and feed mainly on buds, leaves and the fruits of jungle plants. Unusual for birds of this size, many moas have a preference for shiny or glittering objects. If they spot these and can snatch them without major risk, the birds will often steal such items and hide them in their nests. Moa eggs are of an intense red colour, which is why the shells are popularly used by the nagas of Marapur for jewelery and decorations. Both, grind eggs and meat.\n\nTwo-Headed Turtle\n\nThe two-headed turtle has its name for a rather obvious reason: it has two heads. As unusual as this is, the animal is otherwise a common, albeit very large, reptile. It is aquatic and lives mainly in the large reefs around and beneath Marapur. Although it feeds mainly on plants and fish, it can become aggressive and dangerous if you intrude on its territory. The territorial animals do not appreciate visitors. Naga mythology tells, why these turtles have two heads: In the conflict between asuri and naga, they would not choose one side. While the nagas offered wisdom to the turtles, the asuri offered them food. Indecisive and hesitant, the animals turned their heads back and forth between the two parties so often that they ended up with two heads - and neither food nor wisdom.\n\nMakara\n\nMakara are quite unusual amphibious creatures native to the waters of Marapur. They look like a cross between a hippopotamus and a seahorse, but are clearly comparable to the former in size. In earlier times, the makara were often domesticated by the nagas to serve as pack and working animals. However, when the nagas discovered that the giant beavers native to Marapur were easier to tame and less costly to care for and feed, they turned away from domesticating makara. So nowadays, most makara can be found living in the wild. However, they rarely come to the surface, mostly they stay under water, often in already sunken naga ruins.\n\nFoam Stalker\n\nFoam stalkers are elemental water creatures. On Marapur they emerge from the spray of waterfalls cascading down from the mountains. Since they cannot survive on land for long, they quickly retreat below sea level after their emergence and thus populate the reef caves beneath and around Marapur. Because of their elemental bodies, it is often difficult to distinguish them from the water around them. As they roam the reefs, they often  coral branches, flotsam, pearls or small fish with their swirling bodies. These objects can then be seen swirling around in their watery shapes.",

        "text": "My travels in the service of the Tibian Explorer Society have led me here, to this island called Oskayaat, south of Chor and Ankrahmun. It is geographically split into two quite different regions. In the west it is covered with jungle, while a steppe extends in the east. A mountain reach in the centre divides the island into the dry east and the humid, overgrown west. Built into those mountains is the beautiful city Oska. In the south-east, on a smaller island, there is a still sometimes active volcano.\nThe people of Oskayaat are quite highly developed. Their civilization is one of art and beauty, well known for its rich culture and history. The Oskayaans are educated and sophisticated and have a strong appreciation for the arts. They have a deep understanding of history, mythology and philosophy, and they respect and value ancient knowledge and traditions. The culture is rich with religious and spiritual beliefs and the people are very religious and pious as well as peaceful and respectful of others.\nOnce the Oskayaans worshipped Suon, the sun god, and Amati, the moon goddess in equal measure. It appears that Amati is a manifestation of Uaris, which is worshipped as a divine aspect of the moon in some areas of the Darama. As their understanding of the world increased, the Oskayaans started to realize that the suns were the source of all life and the moon only reflects their light. Suon became associated with creation, while Amati was associated with the cycle of life. Eventually, the sun became more worshipped than the moon, as it was seen as the more powerful and important force.\nBut then something happened: A curse reached the island, that transformed people into were creatures. Because the animals are were not wolves or bears but tigers, panthers and crocodiles, the people transformed into weretigers, werepanthers and werecrocodiles. The moon kind of took over. Maybe the curse was brought about by some evil force or deity that wanted to cause chaos and destruction on the otherwise peaceful island. Or perhaps it was just bad luck. But the curse spread rapidly, causing madness and mayhem among the people. I myself have been lucky enough to be spared from the curse so far. I have left the town of Oska in panic to escape the wild beasts that the once so civilised and educated people here have become. I must hurry and reach Port Hope before they pick up my scent and tear me to pieces ...",

        "text": "The special flora of Oskayaat, which is shimmering blue in the moonlight, is a recent phenomenon on the island. There are various theories about its origin. Some think it is related to the moon goddess. Amati is a gentle and benevolent deity who brings joy and peace to the world. She created the dewberry palm and the foxmouse, her holy plant and animal.\nRecently, Amati was in pain because she had witnessed a volcanic eruption destroying and killing many of her beloved creations. She mourned for the loss of so much life and beauty and her tears fell to the earth. Where they did, the plants changed and became bluish in the moonlight. This signifies that the plants are connected to Amati and her tears and that they can draw power from her presence. It is a sign that Amati is watching over her faithful followers.\nOthers are convinced that the reasons are more sinister. They think the plants are affected by something that is already known in other parts of Tibia as the Curse of the Full Moon. Actually, this phenomenon has so far only affected animals. Humans, when bitten by such cursed animals, turn into ravenous beasts themselves: wolves, bears, foxes, hyaenas ... But on Oskayaat, for the first time, plants also seem to be affected. Some palms, ferns or cacti turn into bluish specimens during the full moon. Worse still, it didn't stop with the plants changing only during the full moon. Recently, they seem to change their appearance every night. Our scholars suspect that, at some point, the consumption of dewberries from affected palms could trigger such a transformation in humans as well. It is therefore to be strongly recommended to all inhabitants of Oskayaat to refrain from eating such blue dewberries.",

        "text": "About Foxmice\nThe foxmouse is a mammal species that looks like a combination of a fox and a mouse, yet big enough to serve as a mount for humans. Foxmice typically have red-orange fur, large ears and a shaggy tail. Nocturnal animals, they are most active in the evening and night hours. They are social creatures and are usually found in groups of up to ten, but their subterranean caves are very hidden and hard to find.\nFoxmice have the ability to sense magnetic fields and use them to navigate. Their senses are highly developed and they use them to find food, detect potential predators and communicate with other foxmice. They have sharp eyesight, hearing and smell. Although living in underground burrows, they are excellent climbers and can even scale trees and cliffs with their strong claws.\nFoxmice are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. They will eat berries, fruits, nuts and seeds as well as insects, fish and small creatures.",

        "text": "On Magic Paraphernalia (Donated to the royal library of Bounac by the venerable knight and scholar Galthen)\n\nPreamble\n\nTo raise a question of this magnitude, in times like these and with my record of catastrophic events related to magical items, is problematic at best. Yet, I have to ask: is malice at the core of all magic?\nAnd it will remain a question, open to academic dispute. The implications and consequences to be pondered by those that come long after me - at least from my current point of view. As I have dedicated my life to an oath which I once gave, I spent most of my years on this world's soil discovering and destroying artefacts of old, magical contraptions and mystic relics. Never once did I find goodness at the root of such devices, never once was the outcome of dealings with the arcane a boon to any of those involved. I made this decision a long time ago and even before, in times I was but a child, the mere thought of a talisman or charm would make my guts rebel and darken my mind.\nMy life and my travels, the struggles and deprivations led me to a singular conclusion and clear answer to the question I raised. Yet the author of this disquisition will abide and refrain from speculation. I hereby present but the facts and evidence of the effects of magic upon this world and its creatures. According to my studies and personal research and the kind help of the most helpful individuals Spectulus and Sinclair in the Edron academy. My thorough research was also possible thanks to the flourishing enclave of Bounac. Which I was humbled to be invited to stay at by behest of king Kesar himself. A safe haven during several of my expeditions.\n\nContents\nI Magical Weapons - The Ends Justify the Needs\nII Magical Potions - In Wine there is Truth, in Water there is Health\nIII Magical Contraptions - The Biter will be Bitten\nIV Spells - As the Question, so the Answer\nV Artefacts - Classifaction and Organization\nVI Relics - Seek and you shall find\nVII Curses (abridged)\nVIII Appendices\n\nI Magical Weapons (The Ends Justify the Needs)\nBefore we delve into the muck of current state affairs, the politics of war and the valid but ultimately one-dimensional point of it all, we need to look at the basics of magical enchantment and the creation of mighty armament.\n(The book goes on about the various topics, the writing seems driven and determined but neutral and fair for the majority of content.)",

A new species I first described and classified as \"carnisylvan\", an organic mammal, sentient and intelligent but belonging to the realm of beasts. However, as a catastrophic result to arcane influence, Carnisylvans should rather be described as humans, who have undergone a severe but incomplete metamorphosis.\nThey are inherently human and are probably conscious. What little I could gather from the condition, my specimen was in, There was also human tissue and it had distinctive human features such as teeth, fingers and a familiar, if drastically twisted, bone structure.\nAs I continue my studies on what caused this weird condition, I will take the remains to the academy in Edron for further examination.",

        "text": "Personal diary of Galthen, The Found Man (Maintained by the royal library of Bounac in gratefulness and kind remembrance of the benevolent knight and scholar Galthen)\n\nI met the most peculiar person on my travels. Visiting Carlin for a bit of rest and recreation during a time of peace, still weary from my travels and a recent quarrel with a broken mage, I found this strange fellow half dead in a shed amidst a few unnerved horses. Completely disturbed, mad from hunger and thirst and with no recollection of his recent past. There was, however, a glint in his eyes. Not from the fires of madness but from hope. The maddening search for something, fueling your anger with raw power to go forward and thrive towards uncertain goals. A state of mind I understand only too well.\nSo I picked the poor fellow up and, with the help of a local healer and simply taking some time to listen, I gave him the opportunity to rest for a bit. Turns out my initial impression was quite accurate, he was indeed looking for something. Or rather... someone. It wasn't clear to me at that time what the definition of the thing was, but I now have to assume he was part of a larger organisation. A secret society, formed for the sole purpose of answering a simple question: what is behind \"everything\".\nHe never spoke about his peers, had no family and absolutely no memory of what happened to him or along his way for at least weeks, monthis even. At night he would suddenly wake up, screaming. Putting everyone else in the resting chambers around him, terrifying them by his calls for mercy, not for him but for lost friends and mentors. I got the feeling he was left completely alone and had to endure a most horrible and unfortunate chain of events that led to his ultimate demise. He then screamed relentlessly for half an hour only to fall asleep again out of pure exhaustion. The whole procedure often repeated itself several times until the morning. After a few days he managed to sleep through. Getting ever more tranquil in the process. When conscious he never answered any questions clearly or even directly. His mind is constantly drifting away, there was not much sense in what he said. Yet some of his ramblings showed a certain method behind his thoughts. He actually tried to keep his mind occupied, distracted from... something. As if the mere thought was more horrifying than everything else. While his subconsciousness could barely keep his mind in check during his sleep, he finally managed to compose himself during the day. This gave evidence not only of a significant intelligence but also a great mind. In a week's time, he gained a state of calm serenity neither me nor a healer could get him out of. He refrained from speaking but a word after that. As if the mere thought was more horrifying than everything else. While his subconsciousness could barely keep his mind in check during his sleep, he finally managed to compose himself during the day. This gave evidence not only of a significant intelligence but also a great mind. In a week's time, he gained a state of calm serenity neither me nor a healer could get him out of.

This gave evidence not only of a significant intelligence but also a great mind. In a week's time, he gained a state of calm serenity neither me nor a healer could get him out of. He refrained from speaking but a word after that.\nAs to why I am mentioning this absurd chance-meeting in these notes I would like to state that this driven individual was far from being a madman. My own research and knowledge in this matter have lead to the conclusion that he is indeed one of the Planegazers. A mere myth, a rumor until now. I came across their legend quite some time ago but it was all speculation and tall tales about hidden riddles of our time. Now I look at them with slightly different eyes for even I cast their ambition away as either completely fictitious or downright insane.",

She will not find a trace of Galthen during this time. Scarlett and her remaining knights decide to occupy an abandoned bastion at the eastern shores of the Darama desert. They operate solely from the shadows from that time on. With the power of the amulet, Scarlett can now see all attacks through obstacles and in any cranny. Her body is now immune against every kind of poison, sickness or decay. Her unnaturally long life makes the cobra order grow constantly. Recruits are found in the underground. Where they whisper of Scarlett and the Cobras in the south. Which plunders and hoards, promising riches and power beyond all imagination. These promises and the legendary power of the Cobra, which is carried on in the murky, sordid Taverns and dark corners of Tibia, provides never ending supplies and new blood.\nIn her desperation, Scarett will never interpret the warning of the cursed amulet.

Yet what firmly has its place in the heart of its wearer, the cobra will conceal.\" Taking the amulett, Scarlett is instantly overwhelmed by its grasp and the power it holds within. At this point she is already too weak to destroy it according to her own codex. The dodgy bunch of bandits and assassins she now calls her allies is far from a sworn fellowship. Most of them of dubious morals, full of fear and acting more on their own behalf than that of the group. Thus, noone can muster enough courage to challenge her as she puts on the amulet.

        "text": "\"The Order of the Cobra\" Compendium (by an unknown chronicler)\n\nII - Downfall\n\nAncient guardians of long forgotten cults, powerful secret societies and remnants of lost civilisations crossed their path on the quest to track down cursed relics. When they reached such an artefact, it was destroyed without hesitation. Their resources were always scarce, support from the king was not to be expected anymore. Aquired treasure and burial objects were traded for food and equipment. Two failures in short sequence forced them to pause and stop the undertaking. Resulting disputes between Galthen and Scarlett ended in night long fights without a conclusion. Moral within the whole group rapidly declined. Galthen demanded a departure onto the defensive, remain hidden and focussing on the enemy's weaknesses. Choose only the battles the group can actually handle and let others take care of the rest. Galthen's views were nothing short of treason to Scarlett's ears but she saw wisdom in them. She would never have the heart to banish him from the order and why should she. In the course of a remarkably cold night and after a hefty debate, Galthen disappears without a trace. The order's morals have already sunken so low, that the remaining knights assumed Galthen had resignated in consequence of the ongoing discords. The long, stale period of stagnation lead to resentment and boredom among the nights. Eventually a small group of renegade knights forms to confront Scarlett. When the debate fatally escalates, only a hand full of loyal knights is left to challenge the renegades. One of them loses his life in the process, the others were expelled from the order. Scarlett thanked the loyal men but when she saw their empty eyes, tired and walking outside her tent almost emotionless, she felt more lonely than ever before.\nIn hope of Galthen's return and to boost morale, Scarlett decided to change tactics. The fellowship splits up, goes into hiding. Scarlett now not only looks for artefacts but first of all her supreme commander. The search remains fruitless, however. Years of wasted efforts make her better and reckless. Instead of abandoning this goal, she starts recruiting new and more 'suited' members for her order. A dangerous mix of ragtag bandits, hedge knightsm mercenaries and assassins. Principles and good resolutions start to blur, clear black and white becomes murky grey. Asymmetric partisan tactics and dirty tricks now enter the arsenal of the once righteous order.",

        "text": "\"The Order of the Cobra\" Compendium (by an unknown chronicler)\n\nI - Exile\n\nThe later Cobra order was one of three knightly successor orders, founded by the Etzels under King Xenom. After the falling out with the King, the members of Scarlett Etzel's order left their home town Edron to travel south. They went out to look for artefacts in Darama on a quest to destroy evil in all its forms. Searching and destroying black magic and curses flowed into all kinds of relics aeons ago. Under Xenom, Scarlett was known as unrelenting but righteous as well. She helped the order gain recognition and reputation, even in exile. She enjoyed utmost respect and had a good standing among all members of the order. First of all, Galthen, her biggest critic and best tactician all the same. Scarlett's signature tactics of classic warfare, honorable battles and campaigns with flying colors shaped the order in the first time. On her quest, the knights confronted evil ambitiously and virtuously cared for everyone in need. All at the group's expense, however. Scarce rations where shared with the hungry, leaving the fellowship unfit at times. Selfless and heroic actions took a toll on the now dwindling numbers of the order. Scarlett's campaign was also a thankful target for highwaymen, murderers and wild creatures. Galthen was the only one able to challenge Scarlett and often criticized her ways as too dangerous and brash. More often than once she listened to him, but not in this matter. She was determined to lead her group to the great goals she set way back in Edron. After years of campaigns, battles and shared aspiration, Galthen and Scarlett where bonded by more than hirarchy and their functions within the order. Yet neither Galthen nor Scarlett ever confessed their love to each other. Too important the cause, always too short of time. And so he stood up to her for more than half a decade. Despite her hefty attacks against her strategy, she could always rely on him and count on her spirit and expertise.",

Anyway, it was basically just an empty chest. Came in from the last expedition. I am sure there was nothing in it when I first laid eyes on it. However, when I later checked it in the vault, it had a few coins in it. When I returned with other things, the chest had been removed. Placed right outside the vault. Just to see if everything was alright, I checked the chest. And the coins were gone! I brought it back, together with other valuable stuff. It appeared to me that it would probably be a good idea to just place some of the stuff in the empty chest. But when I opened it, the coins were back, and it seems the thief added even more coins to make up for his mistake,\n(A hastily scribbled note right below that says:) After leaving, I found the chest right outside the vault and it was empty once again! When I put it back, the coins had been replaced and once again additional coins had been put into the chest! Under my watch!! Who does something like that. I will position myself next to the chest and remain in the vault to find the culprit if it's the last thing I do. Furthermore, I swear I saw something a few moments ago. Like a shadow, a shape more than anything.

Not only against the bite of the glorious cobra, but all kinds of poisons. The potency of this poison is so high, that it can paralyze a grown man within the first 10 seconds of it entering the body. Death will follow in under two minutes, so you will probably kick the proverbial bucket before even regaining the ability to move. Just a hint of the poison in a <this part has been completely redacted> will be enough for <again a redacted part> for a whole garrison of warriors. Even an already sensitized organism will not be able to process more than <again a redacted part> which will result in severe stomach aches and... well, if a whole crew of assassins has to deal with the runs at the same time, you will probably wish yourself away to a different place.

Oberon was a collector of arcane devices and magic of all sorts. Yet he wanted to study it only for the purpose of protecting himself from the magic arts. He knew much about magic and always showed great restrain against the seductive aura of power even the most ancient spells emit. He studied the single page for months and deemed the ritual on its pages as the simple teleportation magic we were already used to. A select council consisting of the Grand Master, the Grand Chaplain and the Preceptor were the first to say the incantations and conduct the ritual. We were assured that the ritual was safe and could serve our purpose most definitely. And indeed we found a portal, an opening to a new continent and a clear sign of the path our honourable order should walk.\nSince we first set foot on these new lands, we felt a sensation of dread. Something out of the order, a tingling on the skin. Like a wind that blows right through you and chills your bones. We explored this island thoroughly to build our fortress on stable ground and in good faith. As our fortifications grew, so did our urge to explore the new continent. Several expeditions were made, one edeavour led to the death of two brothers who died after the bite of strange beasts that roam the barren steppes. When we managed to venture further into the north, we encountered a strange plague, befalling these lands: Ravus, the Grey Plague, as our druid calls it. It affects not only beasts but plants and the very soil.\n\nSoon rumors arose that using the spell to get here was an ill procedure and that we should have omitted the ritual altogether. Some did not see how the page or the book we seek help our cause and that we betrayed chivalric code by conducting a dark rite. This left the Grand Master very furious. There was no further debate ever since. The Grand Chaplain banned any talk about what led us here and Preceptor Lazare stated that he would not have any such nonsense anymore or he calls latrine duty for at least a month.\nThe great quest was proclaimed by Grand Chaplain Gaunder under edict of the Grand Master. We were to find and retrieve the Grimoire Impluviatus, the origin of the single page in our possession. The proclamation included an oath to keep the book safe for no man should use its magic to do evil. As only the Grand Master was deemed able to withstand the power of the book, he was chosen as the Keeper of Grimoire Impluviatus.\nThe plague obviously spread but at an unknown rate. We could immediately sense danger from the plants and animals affected by this disease and stayed away from it as best we could. Eventually our expedition led us to a small temple to the north-east of the continent. The room was decorated with two lizard-like statues in the middle, gazing at each other. Next to a small artificial pond we found the grimoire, Impluviatus. When we returned home, celebrations were in order. The task of the Keeper was assigned to Grand Master Oberon with Grand Canon Dominus as his second.\nYet the feeling of dread that loomed so heavily over the island and the continent did not leave us. What we brought with us was a beacon of evil which we would soon find out. Ravus, the Grey Plague, spread among us. It was first discovered on the graves of the brothers we lost in the steppes. Their resting places were desecrated by a vile dark substance, the stench was almost unbearable. The Grand Canon kept most of us away from the unsightly scene and tried to contain it. None of us knows how many times he shoveled up the graves but it could not be stopped.\nOur druid and the Preceptor are working on a solution to the plague. Our quest is far from over, we pray that there is still hope.",

        "text": "Day 1\nIt was a great feast! We were the first guests of the Honorable Falcon Order to arrive. The first time, they invite any delegation to their new outpost. Strangers in a strange new land, it is all so very exciting! We arrived via some form of teleportation, the honorable knights prepared to allow safe passage. The fortress itself is very impressive, more of a bastion really. The great hall filled quickly with countless high-ranking dignitaries from all parts of Tibia. In my role as ambassador and consultant I would never have thought to be invited personally. We stay here for at least another week. Looking forward to meeting the late arrivals before tomorrow's ceremony! When I left our Venore estate, I was sure I'd meet a lot of people - but this is almost overwhelming, really.\n\nDay 2\nThere was some kind of ruckus during ceremony today: someone spilled wine, suddenly everyone started murmuring and then we heard a scream. We immediately got up from the table and I was escorted away. I'm in some kind of tower right now. It looks like they locked me up - for safety they said. Well, if there's anyone I can trust than it's the dignitaries of the Falcon Order. I can't hear a lot of noises out here but when we hastily walked up to this room I heard screams and the sounds of skirmishing. I hope this will be settled soon enough - what is going on?\n\nDay 3\nAt least I have food and drink. I won't get far with this wine and the morsels they seemed to have stored in here but surely someone will come pick me up soon. The loud noises and the skirmishes have stopped several hours ago but nothing else happened. Did they forget about me up here?\n\nDay 4\nNot a single guard. Not a single dignitary, not a soul. They just left me here. When will they ever return? How many days will it take? I doubt the food I found in this chamber will last more than a few weeks. There's only a single window and it's quite small. If I could only find a rope to get out of here. \"Girl, always bring a rope when you leave the house.\", my father said. Every single time I wandered off or strolled outside the estate. See? I listened! But never took it to heart it seems.\n\nDay 5\nFound a nest outside the window, had some eggs in it. I ate one and saved the others for later. How can I get out of here?\n\n(many of the following entries are dealing with killing time and waiting for rescue, some pages have been torn out)\nDay 8\nSomeone walked by outside, no voices. I could only hear footsteps and it was still too early in the morning to see properly. The dense mist you get here in the early hours didn't help as well. Still didn't find a way to fit through the window. It can be opened easily but it's far too narrow for me to fit through. Well give or take another 10 days and I just might...\n\nDay 9\nI threw a bottle with a message out of the window today. Had to sacrifice some of this diary for some quality paper. I still have some wine bottles around here but this was the only bottle I could put a cork in to get it tight enough for a journey over sea. But, alas, somehow it got caught in sea weed or something. I can still see the damn thing right now... I firmly believe my fate is sealed, one way or another.\n\nDay 10 (?)\nWell, I emptied the last bottle of the... red ones. I'm not sure what it was, but I sure can't remember what day it is. At least I got another flask with a cork. Maybe this message will reach someone, it's probably my last chance. No food left for... how long now?\n\nDay 11\nDon't know if I can still see straight, I can't quite make out the second bottle down there so it may have worked... I'm feeling really weak now. For how long...\n\nDay (illegible)\nDefinitely can't see or write properly anymore. Everything feels distant and I can't seem to hear anything from the outside anymore. There's a body here, lying on the ground. I'm not sure if it was there all the time. I couldn't get it... out of the window... I...",

        "text": "The different Orders of the Dark Summoners: Necromancers, Blood Priests and Shadow Masters.\n\nAs it became apparent that the sands of Drefia were an ideal summoning spot and aggregation of Dark Powers, more and more of the brethren of the Dark Cults came and worshiped their Masters. In time, the different beliefs turned out distinct schools of followers, each with their own rituals that specialized and idolized separate aspects of the Dark Powers. The Necromancers were perhaps the earliest of all, soon followed by Priestesses of the Dark Lord, stealthily establishing their rights, rites and temples underneath the sands of Drefia; and in time, quarrels led rival necromancers to found their own groups in which to follow their secret purposes the way they saw fit, and feed - as well as feed on - the dark powers inherent to this place. The Blood Priests worship the fluids of life and death, and above all, blood of course, which they amass in horrendous quantities, as they attribute the most stupefying qualities to this fluid, and experiment extensively with it. This requires a constant supply of fresh bodies, and thus, Blood Priests are avoided even by their fellow Dark Summoners for fear of their life. The Shadow Masters in turn worship the more ephemeral aspect of the Dark Powers, and are extremely secretive to the point of never being seen. Only the Shadow Pupils, their apprentices, mingle with other students of the Dark Arts, and it is rumored by the other schools that they use the shadows of things and beings as a means of travel and transport, and can summon lesser spirits and demons forth from any shadow. This may or may not be exaggerated, but the Shadow School is unmistakeably a very mysterious order with secrets they never share outside their own ranks, and the little we know can only be gathered from their altars at the Dark Sites, where the Shadow Pupils seem to study the aspects of light and shadow , and are often seen pouring over strange inscriptions, and gathering ashes. As far as the author of this book is aware, Necromancers study the flow of life and undeath in all its forms, trying to control life in death and death in life, and ever finding new means of prolonging or shortening one or the other, without being squeamish about their means to do so. In their eyes, life and death are not necessarily mutually exclusive ways of existing - at least as far as concerns their study subjects. The Dark Priestesses seem to have a working relationship with the traditional school of necromancy, if indeed there is one, and specialize in mystic dances and chants that imbue objects and beings with the might of the Dark Powers, channeling the dark magical energies of this place . It is whispered they can hypnotise, drug and control other beings; but it is certain they make splendid salves, ointments, powders and concoctions, and on their wisdom of herbs the other schools draw upon. However, the Dark Priestesses charge heavy fees for their services, and not to pay them to their fullest satisfaction is said to be a sure way of incurring their wrath - which means a slow, painful death. channeling the dark magical energies of this place.

The Shaper records were partly written in the same astral patterns like the Miunir's texts. The Miunir were the once who copied and 'translated' many of the Shapers' texts and stored them in their vast libraries. Since the Miunir treasured knowledge above everything else, they refused to share their knowledge even with their closest friends. When the orcs overrun the Miunir enclaves, most of the knowledge was destroyed and lost forever. Luckily, some of the Miunir's works about the Shapers survived. However, the forbidden treasures of knowledge the Miunir had collected was met with much more interest than the remaining Shapers knowledge. Only recently interest in the Astral Shapers knowledge was revived. Even though the works of the Miunir are often seen as part of the so-called Shaper records, the records themselves are much more important and full of vital information. After being translated, copied and rewritten numerous times, some of these texts, however, are now nearly worthless. The most adequate texts are those written in ancient Miunir. However, since many self-absorbed scientists found it fancy to show off by writing their own works in Miunir, texts written in this ancient language are no longer a guarantee for quality.",

        "text": "Telia and Tigo I\n\n(This book is written in elven language. Contrary to the old elven legends, this seems to have been written less than a decade ago. It contains a tragic tale of two individuals who rejected their heritage and disappeared from the world. Surprisingly, almost all the pages contain a handwritten translation as if to make readers ignore the elven roots of the tale.)\n\nrejection\n\nTigo was always an industrious elf. He helped his kin where ever he could, started his day early and ended it late. Despite his efforts to help his community, he was not a person you'd actually notice much or sometimes at all. He preferred to stay in the background, kept to himself most of the time. Yet this was not to escape the other but to shield himself. Rejection was his one true fear of him, a nemesis that plagued him since he remembered. And his father of him, before him. His time as a happy child within the confines of a loving family was short lived. When his father lost his wife, he spent the following years concentrated on his only son. There were times when Tigo felt the warmth of his father's loving care for him but there were far more occasions where he experienced the meaning of being left alone. He saw the decline of the only parent he directly knew, felt the heat of his rage in times of dispair and the grief in times of solitude. He never wanted to end like this. The decision to stay away from others, to eliminate social interaction as much as possible was quickly made. Even as a youth, he was an outsider of some proportion-but he still wanted to be a valuable member of his community. Unlike his father, who as Tigo reached adulthood, he ultimately left, not to be seen ever again.\n\nsolitude\n\nTigo would not draw attention to him, work for himself most of the time but help the others and provide support any time he could. As long as they left him alone afterwards, leave him to enjoy the peace and quiet of his life as a loner.\n\nshelter\n\nIt didn't help when a villager from a far away town, an outsider himself, came to him. He simply appeared at his doorstep, in the middle of the night. A human, incapable of speech, wounded and alone. Desperate. Desperation was something Tigo was used to since he could count. He took the poor soul in, despite his aversion to having another person so close to him. Especially here, in his own habitat. But what harm could he do, he was in no condition to get on his nerves and didn't say a word. Just a few days passed, the man got better, started eating more, looked outside the windows, started walking around. Indeed his interest towards what happened outside grew with every day, yet he did not make any move to just get up and leave. He just stayed, cowering in one corner of Tigo's house, always focused on the windows. Tigo used a system of gestures to find out if he needed anything or to give him basic directions. It worked somehow and after a few more days, it was good to go. Tigo was not very versed in contact with others, let alone humans. But he saw that his proteg\u00e9 from him got increasingly tense. With every day he grew more nervous, clutching to the windowsill, even checking under his bed.\n\nExit civilization\n\nThe smash. Broken glass and howling wind. He woke up to a room full of people. At least six persons stood around his bed, watching. He jumped up in his sheets and looked at the gathering wide-eyed and in cold sweat. This was something he simply wasn't prepared for. Nor could he ever have. He was not used to that many people and now half a dozen are standing in his very own bedchamber. He got a bit angry and threw the most threatening stare he could manage to form in the general direction of one of the intruders. Then he saw their weapons.",

        "text": "Telia and Tigo II\n\nexile\n\nAfter some time he pieced it all together, at least as best he could without any actual confirmation. While he isolated himself, ignoring most of the talk of the others, even everyday life with all the ups and downs he did not hear from the sinister individual who entered one of their peaceful homes for him one night. The man who simply came and murdered one of their own. The man who took a precious life from this community. The man he gave shelter to. When he realized that he fostered and nurtured what the others perceived as a monster, it was already too late. He never found out if the human he took in was confused or deranged - it's clear that he didn't intend to do what he did - or was it? If the others could only see, understand that he was trying to help... no, the odds where clearly against him. It was him, lonely and secluded, a mystery himself - against all the others, together. With their normal lives, their homes, their families. Now he was truly alone. The guards who arrested him took good care, they didn't even throw him in a cell but him in the guard house. They let him live, choose. For all the good he did to the community, for all the help he provided. If not for that unforgivable last time. He knew what he had to do and would not hesitate to make it so. Maybe he already made this decision a long time ago. As his father did. He chose to forget all this, to leave. He chose exile, the very definition of rejection. They let him live, choose. For all the good he did to the community, for all the help he provided. If not for that unforgivable last time. He knew what he had to do and he would not hesitate to make it so. Maybe he already made this decision a long time ago. As his father did. He chose to forget all this, to leave.

He knew what he had to do and he would not hesitate to make it so. Maybe he already made this decision a long time ago. As his father did. He chose to forget all this, to leave. He chose exile, the very definition of rejection.\n\nRefuge\n\nWhen he first encountered the Barkless, it was their leader himself, Leiden, who took him in. A strong, firm and glorious leader with a vision. He was promised a life of peace, recreation, even appreciation. It would not have been this life, it was already too late for that, but another, a better one. He willingly absorbed all he could from this wondrous leader. An elf himself, outcast and broken but determined to change his fate. Tigo liked that. Very much. And he showed it by helping this small community in all the ways he could. As he always did. Even back when... but that life was over now. He gladly accepted this life of hardship, pain and suffering. He was Barkless, one of them. He would be true in the end, he would get his redemption from him if he only worked for it.\n\nTelia\n\nA new member was introduced, that probably marked the first and only time another person deeply piqued his interest. Telia was a strong woman, she chose this life among the Barkless by herself, her reasons forever a secret. Time passed and she endured the pain and deprivations like no other. At least in his eyes her. She must have traveled far to reach the Barkless, she looked different from other elves. Even exotic in a way but an elf nonetheless. But what would he know, the few woman he laid eyes upon during his life where she either already taken or would not be interested in someone like him. And how would this even work? This life he once led, his life him ... with a woman? But this, new life - this could be different. She would understand. And somehow she did. However, the reader must understand that a real relationship is strictly forbidden amongst the Barkless. A problem in the truest sense of the word. They had to get creative. A look here, a gesture there, a kiss. Just quickly, quietly. No one other shall know...",

        "text": "Telia and Tigo III\n\nInfluence\n\nLeiden changed. Their illusive leader, once a beacon of hope and guidance, mostly tended to himself these days. He locked himself up in his chambers most of the time and did not let anyone near him. When Tigo became a Beacon of the Barkless, the \"Trial\" was already established. A new rule and sacrifice every Barkless now must bring upon him or herself. Some didn't make it, even went insane as they did not bring themselves to finish it. That would not happen to Tigo... and most importantly, not to Telia.\n\nThe Trial and Leiden's Recommendation\n\nWhen the trial came, Tigo was ready but alas, he would be the first not to undertake it. Leiden called him his \"first\" Beacon and that he already proved true. He would not attend nor should he ever. Now it was Telia who needed to conduct the rite. A recommendation from Leiden himself favored her explicitly. She should be next, circumventing the rules of regular ascension. Tigo did not wonder then, he rarely did. Wasn't it great that she was favored? And he would stand watch while she did and both would fulfill their duties as best they could. As she went in, she showed no fear.\n\nRetaliation and the death of Telia\n\nTelia did not return. The chamber of purification, highest honor and apex of the trials proved to be her grave. At first Tigo did not understand. But then he saw that they hadn't been true anymore. Their love and time of happiness, as short and full of deprivation as it was, was not theirs to have. As the Barkless suffer in this life, they rejoice in the next. But Leiden knew, he wanted them to see, to feel this. He must have known that the purification would not work as long as our bond existed. The Leiden he once knew, however, would have guided them. He would have told them. He saved them. But he chose to deepen the suffering. This is not what this should be about. Whatever influence corrupted Leiden, Tigo swore to bring an end to it.\n\nAnd there he stood, waiting. Beacon of the Barkless, as was his duty to this community. And he helped his community all he could.",

        "text": "It is now my fourth day in captivity of the orcs. I have made peace with my life since I'm sure I will not survive much longer. From what I could make out, I'm to be sacrificed to some kind of god that the orcs are worshiping. I learned little about that god but it seems to be an incredibly bloodthirsty one, even by orcish standards. I've seen the orcs driving themselves into some berserk frenzy with singing, dancing and drinking a strange brew that their shaman is giving them. This shaman is the driving force behind this tribe. He is the voice of their god and promised them blood and plunder beyond compare. From what I could find out, he promised his followers a new age of blood in which they would flourish and rule due to the blood of the god. I'm sure he is referring to the brew that he makes them drink regularly. Whatever it is, it actually changes these orcs. In the few days I've been held captive, I've seen several individual orcs growing visibly in size and strength. I've also witnessed fits of rage. On several occasions, an orc killed one of his peers in an uncontrollable outburst. I've also noticed the arrival of a sizeable shipment of quality weapons and armor. It seems they have a supplier and ally with remarkable resources. He is probably linked to the shady figure that arrived here, a stormy night two days ago. He was wearing a dark hooded cloak, but had humanoid features at least. He was too slender to be an orc, almost as slim as an elf. He conversed with the shaman in private. Even with my inevitable death at hand, I can't help to wonder what they are up to. For sure, some well-equipped berserker orcs are a threat to the area but I doubt I will be able to share this information with my superiors in the TBI What I know is, that I don't plan to die as a sacrifice to their god. I will try to escape my prison even if there is little chance I will make it out of the camp. I will hide these notes in the feint hope that someone might find them someday, though it's obvious this would probably mean he had become a prisoner, too.",

A leader who deserves this title and who is ready to restore our greatness once again. Wisdom, determination and new, powerful weapons are his tools to shape the fate of the minotaur race. A new order will arise and the old one will be cast down. The rigid structures that have prevented the young and talented from rising will be destroyed. A new system rewarding skill but also loyalty will be put in place. The race will be united under a new ruler and use all its strength and power towards one goal only: the restoration of minotaur power. But we won't stop there, brothers and sisters. We will forge a new empire of minotaurhood, the likes of which the world has never seen. We will subjugate the other races and put them into the place they belong to. Those who oppose us, though, will be vanquished. A true minotaur will join us in our just cause. Coward traitors, though, who cling to the old ways that led to our downfall, will be crushed underneath the heels of our marching legions. The world will be fully ours. We are destined to rule. The lesser races will bow down or be obliterated. No longer will we hide beneath the surface but rather walk upon it as rightful rulers. We will walk the green pastures once again and our herds will flourish and multiply. Our rule will be absolute and those who have joined our cause will be rewarded accordingly. Those who cowardly hide and wait for the inevitable new order might be allowed to live after we have passed judgment on them. Yet, those who join early and further our goals will become the new lords in the world that we are about to create. Our leader will rule supreme with the godlike powers he acquired and he will grant a fraction of them to those who are worthy. Don't hold back. This is the time to act. Be brave and earn your place in the new order now. Hesitate, and you will doom yourself and your descendants to unimportance for eternity. We are about to bring much needed order and dignity to our realm. You are either with us or against us. Don't be blind to the change that is to come.

Just take a look around if nobody answers. Because I may just as well be dead already. I do not know why Marv has left me a piece of paper and a quill, that bastard. When we landed on this island, there were barely 20 of us. Marv as our captain ordered us to scout the place. It didn't go well. Not far from our landing point we spotted creatures with bigger teeth than our heads and large feet. Without any eyes they just smelled us. They attacked as soon as we laid eyes on them. A dozen other sailors died on the first day, like flies. We were about to retreat, go back home, get backup - but Marv kept on pushing. He ordered us... <illegible part> commanded us to breach that large wall. That wretched wall. He wanted to get deeper into the island. He wanted us to make it fall.\nI always suspected he found something, he knew something. He was hiding something from us and now I know. He showed me, and then he left me here to rot. Never to spill his secret from him. There's just enough ink left to... <the next part is unreadable> So I will just write about what may be most important to you. There are creatures on this island which are so wretched and evil that they carry death themselves. And somehow he managed to hunt one down or maybe it has surrendered to him willingly. Whatever the case, he got his hands on something nobody should ever have.\nBut I need to tell the whole story to make whoever reads this understand. In some gods-forsaken harbor, Marv came by a broken ring. He won a gamble and the other guy didn't want to pay. He talked about how he found this in another dimension or something. About how it was an extremely mighty ring but that broke and that a creature was carrying it. Whatever fantasies that man had, Marv killed him and all he got was that stupid piece of metal. This tainted place was a perfect match for our captain, I can tell.\n\n<there seems to be another page which continues the scribblings>",

        "text": "<page 2 of some scribblings>\n\nOn this dark corner of the world, Marv found a way to actually mend the ring. Whatever Marv did to wrestle this... thing from the abominations on this island, he would never be the same again. It was a simple string of a dark shade, not very large and unnaturally smooth. It looked like it was a shiny piece of metal, yet did not seem to reflect a thing, not even Fafna and Suon's healing gauze. When he pick up that piece of rope it suddenly got a life of its own. It wrapped itself around his arm, while he was still wearing that cursed ring. At first he was shocked but that feeling lifted soon, as he began to fantasize about strength, speed and power. He babbled about seeing things and hearing unspeakable sounds. I do not know if it was still our captain or just something else. Then he seemed to struggle in pain, he screamed and winded himself. We did not dare approach him. After some time he seemed to stop doing anything at all, no more moving, no more talking, not even a single breath. And then he just got up. He removed some dust from his coat and walked away, with a laugh on his lips and a pat on my shoulder.\n\nI am sure it is connected to the ring as he showed me the piece of string briefly afterwards. It did nothing at all to me and I was quick to return it, not wanting to have anything to do with that for it surely meant bad fortune for us all. And it did. Maybe even touching it was my demise. I do not know, nor do I care anymore. All I have to do now is to warn anyone else walks the blood-soaked soils of this isle. The ring turned him into something far more treacherous than what we saw up until this point it seems. When we found out he does not intend to leave this island, the others raised a mutiny. I remained petrified by fear of his reaction from him, as I was one of the few who witnessed first hand what that ring had done to him. And I knew that no good would come of it anyway.\n\nIn the end he killed every soul opposing him. Except for me.\n\nNow here I lie. For he did only destroy my body and chained me to the very walls of this cave. He gave me quill and paper. Why? Maybe to write all of this down.\n\nHan, former First Mate of the SS Primordia\n\nPS.: I have some ink left and I have to say I am unsure of why he wants me to write this.

The mind becomes focused on but one single thing, a stage of all the workings of a desperate soul, until it is worn out by the course of the dead ends, blunted by the rusty blades of inadequate means, chokes on loneliness, and finally dies on the dreary shores of hopelessness.\nThat is why, once despair has taken hold in a soul, it will feed on itself; denying help and drawing other souls to its pitchblack abyss of a mind. There despair may take hold of the other souls, too, for the Lord of Despair is ever hungry, and no one can withstand him for long. Hail Pumin!",

We, that is all of your children: Ra'Clette, Sniff, Queso and me. Found it on a small island. We had to be careful, because some suspicious raccoon captain also roamed the sea around this island. But we found beautiful treasure first! But couldn't decide yet, who will take what. So Ra'Clette had a great idea: We sealed treasure away! How? Listen: Treasure Chest is behind spooky gate. Looks like big skull with maw wide open. Ra'Clette powerful witch, she knew that skull gate is a magical portal. And she knew how to seal it with a spell. So we did this: We all thought of nice little rhyme and used it as secret password for portal. But to make sure that none of us goes there alone and gets treasure, Ra'Clette had genius plan: Rhyme has four lines, and each one of us noted one. Then Ra'Clette cast spell that makes us forget rhyme completely. So each of us has left only line on our piece of paper. Now, each of us only knows one line, so we must return all to open skull gate. One day we will and get treasure, as soon as we know how to share. Only problem is, I don't want to keep written note. Not safe, someone could steal. But I don't have such a great memory, I'm afraid I will forget my line. Perhaps I will teach it to my parrot Larry, who knows. This is it for now, dear parents. I'm now at corym black market underneath Liberty Bay. But will be off to the sea soon and join the pirates! and each one of us noted one.

It said that the old red master himself has trained him. There is no doubt that I am no match for him in a fight. I can only hope he will lose my track somewhere in Thais or Carlin. I will head to the nearby mountains to look for a hiding place there.\nThe gods are with me! Not only did I find some sort of cave, but also a fourth raid covered my disappearance from the town. Now I have to manage to live here for a few years in a hideout, then I might return to the town. I have yet to explore the caves fully. They seem quite huge and I can only hope that I am not running out of luck. I do not want to imagine what would happen to me if I run into some hostile inhabitants here. Still I think my skills are sufficient to handle some cave bears or even some tarantulas. If I run into a giant spider, I might have a problem though. My supply of runes is not large enough that I could spend them needlessly.",

The Ruthless Seven have deployed some of their most powerful lieutenants to ensure the success of their mission. Strangely, the things we read in the minds of these lieutenants did not point to the Plains of Havoc as expected but to the remote isle of Edron. We are aware that there are some ancient ruins north of Edron. Orshabaal, who is a powerful servant of the Ruthless Seven, might appear in this area to scare people away and to distract any attention.

        "text": "The first dragon which reappeared in the awakening world settled down quite close to the human city Thais. The formidable beast knew no fear of mankind and justifiably so. The first humans who encountered the dragon most likely were devoured. It took some time until the word about the dragon was spread by those who eventually managed to escape. Soon heroes flocked to the cave to challenge and slay the beast. The heroes from the morning of the awakening world were only accustomed to monsters like orcs and the occasional cyclopes. For this reason, they considered themselves as invincible. Little did they know about the power of a dragon.\n\nWhen the first of the greatest heroes perished, the world held its breath in shock. More heroes were sent, this times in groups. This time they used the fledgling art of magic, but to no avail. One by one and group by group, the heroes fell. The hoard and the fame of the dragon grew. Then by chance a cunning hero learned that the dragon was allergic to certain flowers. Strategies were devised to use this weakness against it. However, this weakness only ensured that some of the would-be-dragonslayers managed to escape. And although the rediscovered knowledge about magic increased and was successfully used against dragons that appeared elsewhere, the first dragon managed to elude this fate. One day the king decided that action had to be taken against the vile beast in the vicinity of his beloved city. So he gathered an army of heroes from all over the realm to confront and finally slay the dragon. A formidable army was established that marched towards the dragon's lair. Armed to the teeth with weapons, ammunition and runes and their hearts filled with dedication and bravery, they stormed the lair at noon. But the first dragon was gone! All they found was a common dragon, no stronger than the ones they had slain before. In their fury the dragon hunters killed the beast. However, neither fame nor fortune could be gained on that fateful day. All they found was a common dragon, no stronger than the ones they had slain before.

All they found was a common dragon, no stronger than the ones they had slain before. In their fury the dragon hunters killed the beast. However, neither fame nor fortune could be gained on that fateful day.\n\nSince this day, people wonder what has happened to the first dragon. Some believe that this is just a myth or an allegory, however, those who already lived back then attested that the tales were true. Optimistic voices claim that the dragon knew about the approaching heroes and fled the realm of men for good. Others suggest that the first dragon just grew old and flew to the dragon cemetery to die there. Others again fear that the dragon retreated into some remote corner of the world. There it is growing and gaining strength in order to return one day. Then it will challenge all humans and force them to their knees once more.",

If not, ask the subject if he had any TROUBLE lately.\n\nII\n\nNext, ask him if he thinks that the AUTHORITIES will handle the subject that troubles him. If he states that the authorities will solve the trouble, ask him if he thinks that they could have AVOIDED the trouble in the first place. If he confirms that the trouble could have been avoided, he is to be observed for heretical tendencies. If the suspect has not yet shown any heretic opinion, ask him why he thinks that the GODS would ALLOW that such things are happening. If he claims that he doesn't know, it is implied that he doubts this godly decision and is to be observed for heretical tendencies. If he comes up with an explanation that suggests that the gods lack the power to prevent that such a thing happens, than he is to be observed for heretical tendencies as well.\n\nIII\n\nIf the suspect claims that he has no trouble at all, ask him if he thinks that the lack of trouble is explained by the FORESIGHT of the AUTHORITIES.

If he disagrees, he is to be observed for heretical tendencies. If the subject does not show any suspicious behavior at this point, ask him if he thinks that any TROUBLE will arise in the near FUTURE. If he denies it, he obviously will become lax in the line of his duty and he is to be observed for heretical tendencies.

In the light of warnings about some shadow organisation that is known as \"army of the grave\" and other similar names, it has to be assumed said person might have been one of their agents. Even more so, since all of a sudden this person, using the name Luthgar Decars, switched subjects of his research. His new agenda seemed to be to learn about famous knights of the past and lore about their time. Since it seems unlikely, that all of those knights were cursed with vampirism, the sudden change of fields of interest seems odd. Even more since this person used forged documents to access restricted information. It seems likely that this person had malevolent intentions.",

        "text": "The captured vampires were quite young, only a few nights old. They were of no value concerning information about their secret society.\nNonetheless two of them were given to the torturers.\nAs expected nothing useful could be learned, even though the vampiric regeneration could once again be observed.\nGiven the need for information on how to torture the creatures effectively, should a more valuable specimen fall into our hands, several new techniques were tried out. Most proved to be unsuccessful. Eventually both probands died at intended points of the experiment.\nThe other four were subjected to a series of experiments in order to learn more about the nature of the beasts.\nAs expected sunlight had an effect on the creatures though not as severe and effective as one might wish.\nThe vampires showed an incredible fear and aversion to it. Sure enough the tested specimens began to show an actual reaction to the sunlight. Sadly the reaction started off quite slow and later than expected. It took about half a minute before the vampires' skin turned reddish and began to peal off. Another half a minute later their bodies began to smoke, parts of the skin turning to ash. The process continued for another minute before they completely turned to dust.\nOne specimen was lost in that experiment. The others were salvaged in different states of sunburn and began to regenerate.\nAs with other tests it could be observed that the vampires have the ability of regeneration but not of regrowth.\nThe regeneration of those worst wounded took significantly longer than that of the lesser wounded. Adding blood improves the regeneration process considerably.\nIt is to be assumed that human blood would have had additional effects.\nThe worst burnt vampire took two weeks to regenerate, needing a considerable amount of blood.\nThe vampiric body proved highly resistant to cuts and slashes inflicted by magic weapons. Silver lowered that resistance considerably.\nFire and acid proved to be quite effective, contrary to this all administered poisons did not have any discernible effect.\nStakes made of various materials were tested. While some merely immobilized the creatures, blessed stakes eventually turned them into dust.\nTheir strengths and senses were also evaluated. Even the young vampires were extremely strong, matching the strength of three or four grown men.\nThey were all able to see in the dark. At least half of them seemed to have increased hearing capabilities. None of them, neither well fed nor under the threat of death could turn into a bat or a wolf.\nIn conclusion we can assume that the traditional means at our disposal are sufficient to eliminate any vampires we might encounter. To ensure that they will not rise again, the use of a blessed stake is mandatory.\nWe have to assume that the abilities and reactions of older vampires differ, either being increased or reduced.",

        "text": "We have recently unearthed a cult of people who were seemingly demon worshipers. After chasing leads from the local underworld, we managed to follow certain individuals to a secret meeting spot. Since we could not successfully infiltrate the secret society and lost two good men in the process, we decided to solve the matter with brute force. We stocked up the ranks of the city guard with several soldiers. We were confident not to meet any significant resistance due to our authority and sheer numbers. That proved to be fatally wrong for several of our men, though. Through investigation, we had deduced a good time for a decisive strike that would catch the cult in the midst of one of its meetings. Shortly before midnight, we breached the doors of their hideout in the wilds. Two armed guardians in robes fell swiftly. We immediately proceeded deeper into the lair, following the sounds of chanted incantations. That was when things began to go wrong. Some of the men in the vanguard began to stumble and became slower. We still pressed forward eagerly, discounting the irritation to the thick, aromatic fumes that ascended the tunnel from the gathering hall. When we reached the main room, our eyes were full of tears from the heavy smoke. The cultists seemed unaffected. When I loudly announced to them who we were and that they were under arrest, silence dropped. I was sure they would surrender now but suddenly, there was this scream. I don't know who screamed first but a heartbeat later others joined. The whole cavern vibrated from the insane screaming and I saw some of my men dropping their weapons to cover their ears. Then the cultists threw themselves against us in a single screaming mass of hands and daggers. They disregarded sanity and safety; the first wave impaled themselves on the weapons of the soldiers. But that did not even stop them. In hindsight, I'd say they weren't undead or something like that. They just seemed to refuse to die. Driven by insanity and rage, soldiers who knew their trade were killed with bare hands in horrific manners. Some lost their nerves and fled. Yet, others seemed to succumb to a madness that rivaled that of the cultists and started stabbing friend and enemy alike. As I managed to re-establish formation, things got gradually better and in the end, we gained the upper hand. Yet, all cultists lay dead and many of my men had been killed and not even one was without an injury. Later, we examined the corpses and several cultists were identified as local traders and craftsmen. None of them had been suspicious or had any criminal background. After searching their lair, we found evidence that it had been a rather newly established cult. How they had managed to induce so much fanaticism is a riddle to me. Disturbingly, some of the rooms had been built to house something HUGE. It was clear that those were rather living rooms or cells than storage rooms. What all this means, I only can wonder. some of the rooms had been built to house something HUGE. It was clear that those were rather living rooms or cells than storage rooms.

It seems proven, however, that 'someone' had been acquiring assets that formerly belonged to the fallen demons.

        "text": "Ilos was a dashing hero and a ladies man. His exploits and adventures inspired many bards even during his lifetime. No beast was too fierce, no demon too intimidating for Ilos to avoid them. He became a living legend and paragon of all that was considered knightly. In one of his adventures he and his friends cleansed a crypt of a long extinct race from its evil. The deeper they went, the more unnatural and twisted their enemies became. Level after level was cleansed by the fighters and priests yet the catacombs seemed to stretch on an on into the darkest depths of the world. The deeper they went, the more the rune-engraved walls began to shift and whisper as if they had a live on their own. One by one, the party became separated and lost. Only for Ilos the way seemed to open as if something or someone was guiding him to a special place deep within. Determined but confused by constant whispers in unknown languages Ilos continued. It did not even occur to him that he was all on his own by that point. So strong was his urge to move on, to face and overcome the darkness that had taken refuge there. After a journey that might have lasted hours or days he arrived at a huge chamber whose geometry mocked the laws of nature. It was barren but for a single colossal throne in its centre. On this throne of greyish stone sat a regal but horrible figure of nonhuman origin. The mummified thing had multiple arms and an elongated skull with shark-like teeth. When Ilos approached it, he felt that this had to be the source of the catacomb's evil. His sword drawn he stepped closer. And the thing arose. Then it was all dust and blades. A fight of epic proportions erupted. The unnatural entities seemed to have all advantages on its side yet Ilos was determined and had faced other evils before. In the end the exhausted Ilos stood over the broken body of his enemy. In the heap of dust and bones Ilos spotted an amulet that he hadn't noticed before. The gleaming jewel emanated power and as the victor, Ilos claimed it for his own. The catacombs seemingly had lost their magic and though he was unable to find any of his lost companions, Ilos returned to the light of the suns. From this day on Ilos and the amulet became inseparable. He never ever parted with it, even when sorcerers in his circle of friends requested to examine it. He still travelled the land and fought in many valiant quests. But less and less he consorted with other people and he became a loner. With worry his distanced friends saw Ilos staring at the jewel or even sometimes whispering to it. At some point a couple of his friends decided they had to get rid of the amulet to free their friend from its seeming influence. When Ilos was asleep three former companions snuck into his dark room and with the help of some sorcery managed to take the amulet from him. In that moment the amulet bursted into a glowing light and burned the hand of its thief to ashes. Ilos now wide awake swiftly slew the intruders, not even bothering who they were. In a hurry and convinced that he had to protect his amulet he fled the castle where they resided. In the years to come Ilos no longer went on quests. When he was sighted it usually lead to bloodshed by his hand for he had become a bitter and easy to anger man that seemingly was looking for trouble. Eventually he gathered a band of bandits and outcasts from various races and begun plundering the lands. always on the move as if looking for something. The cruelty of his campaign mocked all that was once dear and valuable to him. Eventually his horde was cornered by a superior force and utterly crushed. In the aftermath of the battle Ilos' body was recovered. The mysterious amulet though, was nowhere to be found.",

        "text": "The family line of the Antarel family was tainted with orcish blood since generations. A shameful secret hidden from the public. Though thought to have thinned out enough to no longer pose a threat, this assumption was disproven by the birth of Marik. Born with obviously orcish features he was hidden away and declared a miscarriage. While he was raised by an elderly couple in service of the baron as their own, three years later a brother, Gisbar, was born by the barons wife, who was declared the official heir. The baron, perhaps out of a feeling of guilt, chose young Marik to be raised as one of his squires. Marik proved extremely skilled in the art of battle. Growing almost disturbingly fast in size and strength, with 14 years he could go toe to toe with the best of the barons knights. Yet due to his heritage knighthood remained beyond his grasp. After the baron died by a riding accident when Marik was 17 years old, he became the squire of his younger brother, without either of them knowing about their relationship. Albeit Marik was known for his fits of rage and shunned by others for his brutish looks, the two became good friends and were nigh inseparable. While Marik fell in love to the fair maid Marisha it was his brother who would court and marry her in the end. When Gisbar officially became the baron, he ignored the traditions and knighted his friend and squire. This didn't suit the other knights and nobles well and what has been hidden mockery in the past became open provocation of Marik. The hot headed Marik duelled three of the nobles, maiming them badly, until baron Gisbar had to order him to stop this behaviour. Not much later though, the anger over insults overwhelmed Marik again, and this time he slew his opponent without any declaration of a duel. Gisbar had to judge over this case and in an effort to save his friend and former squire, he settled to banish Marik from the realm. Marik lived a while as a mercenary in foreign lands, always longing for the place he once called home. When he learned that his 'father' was in his death bed and Gisbar and Marisha were expecting their first child, he decided to return home in disguise. His dying father confessed to Marik the circumstances of his birth and heritage. Marik was devastated on many levels. Without any idea how to react or what to do, he attended the feast for the barons new-born in disguise. Wine and beer were served freely and like everyone else in the feast ccc became drunk. When the jesters and musicians entertained the crowd, one particular ugly and disfigured jester caught the attention of the equally drunk Marisha. She pointed at the poor creature and yelled that he almost looked as ugly as that oaf Marik. The whole drunken crowd joined her in laughter. This was when Marik drew his weapon. With fury and madness he slaughtered not only his brother and his wife but the whole entourage. With the help of his mercenary comrades he held the barony for a few months, even petitioning the king with his plight. In the end though an army was sent to bring him to justice. Before they arrived, ccc took his own life and the mercenaries took him with them to give him a proper burial.",

        "text": "Sir Necaran was a scientist first and a knight only second. He has always been fascinated by animals like snakes, spiders and even the fabled basilisks. So over the course of his studies he became a master of poisons. He developed the philosophy that only the weak would succumb to the power of the poison while the strong would not only survive but eventually become stronger by the ordeal. To overcome weakness one had to overcome the various poisons. Therefore he applied all kinds of poisons to himself, to become immune to them over the cause of time. Several of the poisons though induced hallucinations and emotional instabilities. Some of the poisons even had an addictive potential. Oblivious to such dangers Sir Necaran continued his Quest. He acquired the poisons of some of the most deadly beasts of the known world and despite setbacks he seemingly overcame them all. He even begun to see the hallucinations as divine signs that he tried to interpret in his feverish mind. More and more he turned to the poisons that granted him the most intense vision. In one of these poison induced trips, however, he went on a rampage. Seeing demonic monsters everywhere, he slew several of his unsuspecting friends on a minor slight. After the poisons effect waned away he recognized in horror what he had done. He fled civilisation to live in the remote wilderness. But the longing for more visions and stronger poisons endured. With a makeshift laboratory he begun to extract poisons again. Ultimately little of the man that he once had been remained and he completely succumbed to his addiction. The forest that he lived in became feared for the mad man that haunted it. No sane person travelled there anymore without dire need and in the villages around the forest wanderers were warned and children were scared with the man of the forest. Now and then a lost wanderer made his way into the forest. It's said that it was as likely to be met with hospitality and aid as to meet ones end at the hands of a ravening berserker. Over time the person of Sir Necaran slipped into obscurity and only the legend remained. After several years though members of Necarans former order searched the woods, not even sure what they were expecting to find or certain how to handle this situation. They only to find his corpse in a cave that he seemingly had called home for the last years. It is said the body was in a bad shape and the knights were unable or unwilling to learn the cause of his death. It was brought home for a proper funeral.",

        "text": "The red knight was born into the ancient noble house of Gorlar. Though never numerous, the Gorlar were always in a position of privilege and power. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world though, house Gorlar was still ruled by its founder Count Boras Gorlar, who was a powerful vampire. Under his iron rule the mortal Gorlars made their political moves and decisions. The mortals of the family were his mere puppets, allowed to live and serve as he deemed it fit. Now and then he would 'cull' the herd of his family by claiming the life and blood of a descendant he was as unfit or just useless for his plans. He kept the number of the family members small to better keep them in check. Generations of Gorlars provided him with victims amongst their serfs. Although Boras sometimes promised to raise a worthy descendant as a vampire, he never felt like allowing anyone else this amount of power. The red knight was like other of his family shrewd and ambitious. But his skill and cunning impressed even the old Boras. The red knight not only fulfilled the requests of his ancestor, he often improved the plans on his own and met even more spectacular success than expected. Though Boras tried to tempt the red knight with promises of immortality the latter was well aware that this would never come to pass. So he secretly sent his spies to find him another vampire, to acquire the vampire power on his own. What he found, however, was an old alchemist who was well versed in the lore of vampires. With his potions, ointments and toxins he planned a coup to overthrow and  his ancestor. On the longest day of the year, when vampires are at their weakest, he and his men overpowered the vampire and bound him in chains. With exotic ingredients, the blood of the ancient vampire and the blood of many innocent victims they distilled an elixir that would grant them longlivety. Over the decades the need for more and more frequent applications of the elixir became necessary and more and more people lost their lives over this unholy quest. In the end the alchemist succumbed to old age and the red knight became more desperate. In a finally gambit he drained Boras of all of his blood and tried to become a vampire on his own by dark and unholy rites. The rites failed him though and with the last source of the elixir gone he shrivelled and aged within an hour after the new dawn.",

They consist of people who feared for their influence and wealth they had accumulated in the past by exploiting their power and the flawed regency system. Some of them were philosophers with wild ideas about gods and the like. Madmen who feared that the wisdom of the dragon kings would pierce the webs of deceit they had woven over the minds of their lizard brethren over centuries. Others were part of the military - mainly those fat and lazy leaders who were responsible for the defeats in the wars against the orcs and who made thousands of our soldiers victims of their incompetence. They feared for their positions and wealth. Still, they were only a few and their desperate lies melted away in the light of the dragon kings' glory. They gained little support at all, and so they tried the unthinkable, to poison and to assassinate the dragon kings in one single night. But the dragon kings in their wisdom were well prepared and the assassins were met with solid resistance and soundly defeated. Of course those responsible for the cowardly attack did not participate in the fight. They hid in remote fortresses while their misguided tools died. But the imperial armies under the leadership of the dragon kings rooted them out and punished them with death.

        "text": "So it came to pass that the elder gods created Banor the Divine Warrior. He was the very first human, and though his creators gave him powers no other member of his race would ever be able to match, he already displayed many characteristics clearly which proved him to be human. To this very day he is especially revered as an ideal of chivalry and bravery by those who dedicate themselves to the art of hand-to-hand combat, for he was just and brave in battle, and his prowess of him with the blade is legendary to this very day. Legend has it that the gods were also planning to create a twin brother for Banor, and that this twin was to wield incredible magical powers. However, it is said that Zathroth stole this prototype to create from it the very first demon overlord. Whatever the truth, the fact that the humans had entered the world of Tibia could no longer be overlooked. For despite their many weaknesses they were a brave and clever race, and they adapted surprisingly well to the grim world into which the gods had cast them. They took up the fight against the undead and the various others despicable creatures that roamed the lands, and soon the hordes realized that a new, powerful enemy had arisen.Many a fierce and bloody battle was fought, but Banor, a brave and shrewd leader , led his people from victory to victory. Still, those triumphs were often paid for with heavy sacrifices, and the sheer numbers of enemies the humans had to face was overwhelming. The gods did all they could to assist their new champion race in its struggle. Uman introduced the race into the arcane art of magic, and many a human followed his vocation to become a powerful sorcerer. Others were instructed by Crunor the Lord of the Trees to learn about the secrets of life, and they became druids and learned how to heal those of their brethren who were wounded in the war against the relentless enemy. Of all humans it was them who learned most about the secrets of life, and in fact some of them assisted Crunor in creating many creatures that populate Tibia today. But many of their creations were soon enough wiped out in the course of the cruel struggle. And the war went on and on. Banor had established a strong foothold in the land, and he consolidated his rule of his by founding a dynasty. He married Kirana, the noblest of all women, and she bore him Elane, who eventually came to master both the arts of distance fighting and the arcane art of magic, thus becoming the very first of the noble paladins. To this day the position of the leader of all paladins must only be filled with a woman, and those who do so invariably adopt the honorary name of Elane. Later on Elane fought side by side with her father, because Banor, who was in fact a demigod, was to live for many centuries. But even this did not help to turn the tide. The human warriors triumphed whenever Banor led them, but then the mighty human champion could not be everywhere, and those human armies that went into battle without him were vanquished by the dark hordes all too often. who was in fact a demigod, was to live for many centuries.

        "text": "Finally, Banor again turned to the gods to help him, and they answered his prayers. Again it was the ever-resourceful Uman who had found a solution, a solution that was possible because he had made the most amazing discovery: He had found that beyond the very fabric of existence there were other dimensions, far-away planes in which even the elder gods held no power. However, Uman had found a way to establish a connection to these alternative planes of existence, and after much experimentation he had learned that it was possible to conjure souls of living creatures from these planes. When brought to Tibia these souls could be turned into human shape, forming the champions the human race desperately needed. This, then, was the answer to the human's problems, and it was swiftly put into practice. The gods planted a number of magical gates on Tibia, gates that were soon referred to as Portals of Souls. Through these gates a steady flow of heroes came into the world, human warriors that were both cunning and brave, and with the aid of these champions the abominable hordes were slowly but surely pushed back. At the long last it looked as though the order would be restored. Things looked brighter for the human race than they had done in a long time. The allied powers of heroes and humans advanced further and further into the enemy's territory, and the dark hordes seemed to stand on the verge of utter defeat. But alas! Those who believed that the old races would now be wiped from the face of Tibia for good were a little hasty, because something unexpected happened. Faced with the seemingly overwhelming might of the human armies the old races did what for aeons had been unthinkable: They signed a truce. Dragons, orcs, undead and all those other races that had fought amongst themselves for so long suddenly stopped attacking each other and concentrated on their war against the human race. And so it came to pass that again things took a turn for the worse. Even though their enemies did not trust each other enough to form any alliance worth mentioning, the sheer fact that they stopped fighting amongst each other brought the human race into a very precarious position. Soon their advance was brought to halt, and once more they were forced onto the defensive. The human armies decided to withdraw to their fortified cities to resume the war there, but again they made a surprising discovery. For this time, the very first time in recorded history, the enemies of the humans did not rush after them to take up the fight. Many were puzzled by this, as it was not readily apparent why the hordes acted this way. A common theory was the tensions and the mutual distrust between the old races was too strong for them to combine their forces in a sustained campaign, and some even claimed that they had started waging war against each other once more. Others suggested that the old races had exhausted themselves in the course of the many wars, while still others hinted that perhaps an equilibrium had been reached, a status quo which all sides felt they could live with. Whatever the reason, a period of restless but fundamentally stable peace ensued, and it lasts to this day. For the very first time the troubled world has a reprieve from the ceaseless slaughter which troubled it for aeons.

But it's more about creating the perfect servants what he really is doing. He might have had more noble goals in mind when he started out but in the course of his experiments he got further and further away from the ethics that might have once guided him.\nIt began with the vivisection of creatures like minotaurs and after that his own creations. Later I learned of the test subjects he acquired. First we were told they were criminals and crazy people. But I learned that most of the poor souls have been abducted. Homeless, poor, villagers and the like.\nHe not only tempered with their body but also their brains to make them see some mixture of pack leader and god in him. And indeed playing god seemed to become his favourite pastime more and more. The unscrupulous experiments, his disregard for his test subjects and even the creatures he eventually created were just disgusting.\nI will try to flee this island and expose him to the public.",

They got hold of a big fish-a Venorean trader which was packed with gold, gems, finest cloth and the finest weapons and armor you can get in the whole lands of Tibia.\nPirates as they were everyone wanted the lion's share of the treasure and there was a mutiny. Klaus wrote in his diary about an unspeakable slaughtering which ended when only four of the whole crew were left. They knew they wouldn't be able to navigate the ship with less then 4 people so they made an agreement. They hid the treasure at a safe spot, made a map which was cut into four pieces. Everyone of them got one piece of the map and was told to secure the treasure with a trap...a riddle...that only he knows. The names of the surviving pirates were: Nutty Jack, Rapp Scallion, Captain Nathaniel and of course, Klaus.",

        "text": "We, the werelions, are the golden children and the chosen among all were creatures. We are fundamentally different from all other known were beasts: We have learned to control the Curse! In our were form, we don't turn into wild beasts that mindlessly attack anyone who comes close. Rather, we have the same control over ourselves in this form as we have as humans. We can consciously turn into our werelion form or back into human shape. Originally, we were some city guards of Darashia, who were bitten by a werelion during an expedition outside the city. The guards retired into the desert, but one of them, a man named Kalim, was so strong-willed that he managed to control the Curse. He taught the other guards to achieve this control as well. Thus, they were able to return to Darashia undetected and continued to protect the city in human form. They also set forth to find and kill all of the wild and uncontrolled werelions - with success. Gradually, they got so used to the Curse that they saw it as a gift rather than a burden. They therefore began to deliberately pass the curse on to others whom they considered worthy - and from then on no longer called it \"the Curse\" but \"the Gift\".\n\nOver time, we, the werelions, developed our own secret subculture within Darashia. At that time, we also began to fight the werehyaenas, who kept getting too close to the city. This caused the old hostility between us and them. We mostly prevailed and were able to protect Darashia. However, as our number increased, we withdrew from the city, knowing that people's fear of us would be too great to accept us as part of Darashia. We trained some human guards as a special unit of hyaena hunters to continue our task, then left the city forever. We retreated to the Lion's Rock on the northern coast of the Darama Desert. Deep beneath this rock we created the so-called Sanctum, an extensive complex that resembles a mixture of palace and temple. For a long time already, we had been not just warriors, but also scholars, artists, craftsmen and architects. A wereliness named Timandra drafted the plans for the Sanctum, and we built it under the Darama Desert over the course of many years. We created our own unique architectural style, which is of course characterized by motifs and depictions of lions, but is otherwise more reminiscent of Ankrahmun than Darashia. Another recurring motif is the connection of sun and moon: We, the werelions, see ourselves as children of the sun Suon, but are also aware of our connection to the moon, which we call Uaris. Until today, our powers are strongest at the time of the full moon. Therefore, we created mosaics in the Sanctum that show a connection between Suon and Uaris, our father and mother.

They acquired all parts of the godbreaker and risked their miserable lives willingly. If they could only appreciate our higher course in the name of Variphor! I'm glad to hear your manipulation of Ferumbras was quite a success, too. His vanity and lust for power made him the ideal candidate. All the years of work finally pay off. It must have been Variphor's might that allowed us to put all the pieces together just in time. Not only will we be able to use Ferumbras' ascension energy to open a breach for our master, we will also have just the weapon he needs, to destroy all the gods once and for all! Soon, his rule will begin! When this letter reaches you, your part of our plan will most likely also be fulfilled, and the magical energies which Ferumbras stole, gathered and accumulated all these years will be used to our ends. I would just love to see his face when he realises what is happening! I will use the coordinates you sent to open a portal to his hideout. This will force our stupid heroes to confront him in his ascension. The beauty of the plan is that they will have to engage him to prevent him from becoming a god. Regardless of their success, the energies will be used to strengthen the rift and hopefully allow the master to fully enter. If they fail, his ascension will open the breach for Variphor - if they succeed, the rogue energies will tear a breach of their own! The sudden flux of energy will leave Ferumbras more vulnerable, and so the pathetic heroes might even stand a chance. Should they fail though, Ferumbras will certainly go on a rampage, using his godly powers to cause chaos and destruction, furthering the master's hold on reality as a whole. Variphor's arrival is inevitable. I will just have to make sure to teleport away in time, before the fools arrive, and hand my servant this letter. I don't think they will ar...",

        "text": "Not by choice but the twisted laws of nature of this plane the unthings slowly became things. Though they manifested in different forms, some rough types were the most common. Probably guided by the nature of that weird place. And there, in the deep below, they became aware of each other. And they looked upon their own kind with the only feeling that they knew. The great hunger. A terrible war of extinction began beneath the surface of what would become known as the caverns of Zarganash. A fierce war that knew no mercy or remorse. And yet there was no one that could have noticed it. When the war ebbed, most of the large number of entities had dwindled significantly, but the successful competitors had become huge and bloated. The most successful of their kind had taken the shape of what mortals would call worms. They dwelt in the depths of the plane, never traveling too close to the surface, constantly looking for souls whose burden let them sink into the embrace of the depths. This was the way for many aeons. The caverns of Zarganash became a vast plane, filled with all the lost or those in denial. Occasional travelers would pass by and leave their mark, some of the souls that were bound to the plane even retained or regained their consciousness. Most of the latter would pass into the afterlife but others took it upon them to stay. Some of them with good, others with more evil purposes. Occasionally a mighty necromancer would rip a rift into the realm, in their attempts to enslave the lost souls for their own sinister purposes but for a long time the caverns were quiet and solemn as it was fit for a sub-plane of death. I was one of the souls lost in their own suffering. Once a great scientist, there was so much left to do at the time of my untimely death. Remorse and self-loathing would have torn me apart eventually, a feast for the worms. But I met my master and teacher, or better, he found me. He managed to break the cycles of thoughts that entrapped me and made me aware of my state. Over time he even taught me how to let go and free myself from the burden I thought to carry. He taught me about the caverns of Zarganash, what he and his predecessors had learned and schooled me in the various philosophies he studied under his own mentors. When he finally decided to move on, I stayed to carry on his work and do my best to help others who are lost. Time means little here so I can't tell how long I hardened but recently things started to change. Something weakened the barriers between worlds and planes. Our plane fared no better. More and more of the lost souls pour out into the world of mortals. Some of the lost seemingly even stumbled into the afterlife by chance and I dread what fate might await those unprepared or what havoc they might cause at places they were never meant to be. However, bigger threats are arising. Even in our planes the barriers are falling and the hungry worms are on the move, all too eager to devour. That would be alarming enough but things recently got much, much worse.

        "text": "The pale worm was thought by most of us to be a mere legend, an allegory, and for all I know it might have been that way for a long time. He is the embodiment of the hunger and the feeling of unfulfillment that is present in this plane. I can't tell what this thing truly is. It might very well just be the biggest and most powerful incarnation of the hungry worms, the one that has devoured so many souls and others of its kind so huge, bloated and powerful that it is on the verge of becoming a demigod of this plane. Or if it is the avatar of the hunger that is inherited to this plane. A spiritual creation of all the ambitions and scorn that became some kind of god of the lost dead without their conscious participation. Perhaps though, the pale worm is something entirely different and foreign. Be it as it may, what at some time has been some allegorical threat has certainly become a real one. Even worse, he is worshiped by some of the most deprived souls that this plane harbors. Twisted by their inner darkness, those souls found even more power in their service of the worm. I dare not to meddle with such tainted beings nor would they be eager to tell me about their affairs so I can only make assumptions, based on hearsay and the weak evidence I could gather. It hints that with the appearance of the pale worm some of the most corrupted begun to worship and serve the worm. It seemingly had enough sentience by then, to spare them. In turn the worm received more sentience and even intelligence from the reverence they bestowed him with. Even more so the worm now feeds not only on the souls that were already in the phase of dissipating but on fresh and just arrived souls his cultists feed him. All of this gave the worm not only a twisted form of sentience but also a purpose, though what this ultimately may be I can not tell. For now it seems he is in the process of devouring each and everything on the plane and will eventually BECOME the plane, immediately feeding on the souls that arrive here, even only in passing. But the hunger can't be ended or even blunted. It will drive the worm to devour more and more, eventually threathen everything with its growing power. I will try to learn more about it's machinations and confront one of his minions from him, perhaps I might learn more. But I fear their power. They were some of the strongest souls here even before they pledged themselves to the worm and I don't know what powers and gifts they acquired from their dread master. In case I don't return, these notes might give some insight and warning to any seeker of such knowlegde.",

        "text": "Zarganash is a word from an ancient language that outlived its creators. It describes a complicated state of a place that wasn't meant to be or does not really exist, yet defies this nonetheless by 'being there in a certain way'. The whole concept is warped in convoluted philosophy and metaphysics modern researches still try to figure out, causing heated debates in informed circles. Marginalised as a fringe philosophy, the concept gained new prominence when necromancers adopted it for their own purposes. In a time when even death was young, the caverns of Zarganash were just a place without much dimension and reality, where some of the souls of the dead rested for the length of an afterthought before they passed into the great beyond and whatever might await them there. In the aeons to come myriads of souls of all kinds passed by and went on. Now and then a soul was not willing to depart the mortal world and tried to anchor them in the Zarganash. Over time the place that wasn't a place also harbored more and more souls that lost their way in despair, neglection or defiance. The formless doorstep to the afterlife gained substance and dimension by the mere presence of the lost souls. If became a bleak reflection of their despair, formed from the residue of undefined desires. The souls would stay there without finding any rest and were slowly torn apart by their own regrets and a hunger for all the things they felt they were denied in life. These feelings weighed heavily and seeped deep into the ground and base of the nascent plane. Deep down where the reality of the plane bordered the void of nothingness these dark hungers, eager to devour themselves, clustered. Over time entities emerged that were born from these hunger clusters. They were unformed, without sentience and without shape or purpose. The one thing they had was their insatiable hunger. So they began to actively devour the souls whose burden let them sink so low, that the hungering unthings could reach them. Following the stream of souls upwards, the devouring menance slowly over the course of centuries, even aeons, ascended. But the plane had changed too. The torn feeling of countless souls had formed a bleak world that had gained some reality on its own. The physicality of the world above kept the undefined hungering entities away, at least for a while. Over time entities emerged that were born from these hunger clusters.

There are few adventurers who do not cherish those moments of silent glory when they have just brought down a whole crowd of enemies with a single Great Fireball.

Only recently, they mastered to control holy powers to their full extent. There are rumours that the elder gods themselves had their hands in the development of the Divine Caldera spell. Whenever this powerful spell is cast, small holy fires appear which rise to powerful ankhs blasting your foe's body and finally burst into little sparkles that quickly fade away. Every paladin that has this spell at his disposal has a great advantage in every fight against the undead.",

If a knight speaks the magic words for this spell, his weapon will be dashed against the floor and let the ground shake. The power of the attack will rise with his skill to handle the weapon he is fighting with. The type of damage a knight is dealing when casting this spell depends on the weapon he is carrying.

For this reason the crafty sorcerers and druids are constantly looking for new ways to assist the Tibian heroes and to guarantee their survival. This spell was one of the more uncommon solutions they have found. Starting from the thought that to survive a battle means to live to fight another day, the researchers developed it to help adventurers to escape from fights they cannot win. Using their excellent medical and anatomical knowledge, the druids found a way to magically generate powerful adrenaline rushes which allow the caster to perform superhuman feats for short periods of time, allowing them to outrun most common creatures. It has to be said that some reckless sorcerers proposed a different approach which was actually based on the manipulation of time itself. This approach, however, was quickly dismissed by the wise council at Edron's magic academy, since it posed imponderable risks. Unfortunately, however, these studies were carried on in secrecy. Later on, they led to the creation of the more powerful, but dangerously unstable Strong Haste spell.",

Ignoring the heated discussion who was first to channel the purest power of their area of expertise, it can be said that all traditions came up with their results almost simultaneously. Probably due to the general knowledge that the other guilds were experimenting on that matter, a competitive race to reach that goal first had started. In the end the result was the creation of an avatar empowerment by each of the guilds.\nThe transformation into an Avatar of Storm is an offshoot of alchemical research to transform lead to gold. While being unsuccessful, the experiments yielded several side results that had little to do with their original intention but have proven worthwhile nonetheless.\nIn this case one of the results was a potion, that in itself seemed of little effect. Yet prolonged exposure makes a body highly reactive to the channelling of elemental powers.\nBy usage of said potions over time and the simple usage of elemental spells, a sorcerer attunes his body more and more to the elements.\nIf the attunement has reached a certain point, it's relatively easy for the disciplined mind of a sorcerer to channel said elements through his living body like using a complicated yet controllable spell from his spell book.\nThe sole problem is the amount of strain such a transformation puts on a caster and maintaining it for too long lead the first users to explode in spectacular manner.\nSince it is sorcery work, in a formulaic way, it was easy to put several restrictions into the formula and create a powerful and manageable spell that puts the caster into minimal danger.",

After many years of research they finally succeeded in altering the cure poison spell so it could be bound to a rune.

Especially creatures with a sensitivity to ice, so to speak all fire dominated beings, will be wounded badly by this reliable spell which can already be learnt by rather young magicians. As the damage caused by this spell is determined by the caster's magical abilities, this spell can be a deadly weapon in the hands of an experienced magician.",

Having extensively researched the arcane art of alchemy, a field of traditional expertise of all druids, Arthiniel found a way to instantly solidify fluids by using magic. Looking for a practical application for his discovery, Arthiniel managed to bind the spell into a rune that could be used against an unsuspecting opponent in combat. The effect of the spell causes the target's blood to thicken, leaving him paralysed and unable to fight or escape unless the effect has worn off.Today, the spell is rarely being used because it has a number of drawbacks. For instance, its effect can easily be broken by any form of healing magic, and quite a number of Tibia's monstrosities are simply immune to it. Worse, Paralyse requires the massive use of mana both during the creation of the rune and during its application, making this an uncommonly expensive spell. However, despite these disadvantages the spell has obvious potential since it is almost sure to buy its user precious time in combat.On optional PvP game worlds, you can only paralyse characters with whom you are at war.",

At first elemental energies that sorcerers are used to wield are broken down into their more basic and unspecific components, which mimics their corruption while bypassing a real tainting effect to the caster. Then it uses this raw negative energy to reduce the damage that a creature is able to deal.

For this reason the Intense Healing Rune was hailed as a big achievement by all Tibian adventurers, and it was soon found in every adventurer's backpack. Today, however, the rune is no longer as popular, since it was replaced by the much more efficient Ultimate Healing Rune. However, it is still commonly used by young adventurers who are not skilled enough yet to use the famous blue runes. Also, since the rune's effectiveness is determined by the user's magic skill it is still popular among experienced spell casters who use it to get effective healing magic at a cheap price.\nPlease note that on optional PvP game worlds, the rune has no effect on wild creatures.",

On casting this spell, a ray of concentrated energy is shot in the direction the caster is facing, electrifying everything in its way.

Only the immunity to earth damage will allow a victim to survive the effects of this powerful attack. All druids who are thinking about using this spell should be careful though, because of its massive range of effect and its substantial mana cost.\nAs the magic potential of a druid is only strong enough to master one such powerful spell, Wrath of Nature and Eternal Winter share the same cooldown, before either of them can be cast again.",

Whereas the knights version of the spell forces the opponent into close combat, the paladin version attacks their senses. It doesn't affect any sensory organs but directly affects the processing of such information in the mind of the targeted creature. The now, so to say, short-sighted creatures have to engage in close combat, to be able to hit their enemy at all. To this end ironically principles are applied that were observed in botched healing spells of novice paladins. Technically holy energy is sent to the enemy and then just released, but in a controlled way. Another irony is, that this faked botch needs a high amount of experience and skill.",

Fast and deadly, the sorcerers' widespread reputation of gruesome efficiency in combat is largely based on this devastating spell. Nearly no other spell can compare to Sudden Death when it comes to sheer damage. For this reason it is immensely popular despite the fact that only a single target is affected. In fact, most sorcerers and druids and quite a number of skilled paladins always have a couple of Sudden Death runes in their backpacks in case of an unexpected ambush. However, a wary adventurer will not blindly rely on his Sudden Death runes to save him in any position. Since the damage caused by the rune is of deadly nature, it is less useful against most undead creatures.\nDue to the enormous power that is bond to this strong rune, it can only be used by players who have experience level 45.",

Furthermore, physical attacks, carried out by its horns, belong to its repertoire as well. So injured monsters suffer deep wounds, bleeding for quite a while. It is said, that the most devout and skilled heroes are able to gain an intrinsic understanding of such summoning spells, that they are able mould and warp it's energies to call forth a wider array of minions, that, though identical in power and abilities better suit their own taste and style.

Vague legends of old told a story of a vanguard dedicated to Banor who ventured forth into the frozen north in a desperate attempt to stop a scheme of the forces of evil to build a powerful weapon. The heroes of Banor succeeded but at the cost of their lives. Honouring their dedication, Banor struck a deal with an elemental entity of the north who owed their existence to Banor and the heroes' sacrifice. They were entombed deep into the ice, save from all temperings of evil. Their noble souls, however, knew no rest and pleaded Banor to help humanity once again. At last the godly warrior agreed and with the help of Fardos he provided his champions a ghostly squire unlike anything seen before. The energetic essence of ice stemming from the surrounding area was conserved within the newly created ethereal creature. Its deadly sight alone makes not only humans but also monsters tremble in fear. The way of movement - just flying around like a ghost - makes it even more frightening. The Skullfrost doesn't have a very strong defence and prefers to attack from a safe distance. More precisely it uses death and ice attacks. Due to these skills the knight does well to pull its adversaries to himself while its summon attacks from afar. A powerful combination!

This spell painfully cauterizes any wound and instantly forces mana to be converted to raw life-force. Therefore the spell is known to leave hideous scars but the knights guild has little concern for vanity and approves only usability. Though druids see this spell more as butchery than healing art, even they can't deny the efficiency of this primal approach. The immense pain that accompanies the usage of the spell is nothing for the squeamish and so the spell is only taught to veterans who have proven to be able to handle pain and injury in countless battles.",

        "text": "The study of magic is a time-consuming activity that requires many years of dedicated research and academic work. For this reason those who have chosen the path of magic usually neglect physical exercise, training their minds rather than their bodies. As a result, spell casters are typically frail and cannot endure injuries the way skilled warriors can. However, sorcerers and druids reacted to this problem in their typical manner, looking for magical means to protect their weak bodies in battle. The Magic Shield spell was the result of this research. By casting this spell it is possible to deflect any physical or magical damage by using sheer will power. Unfortunately, however, the mental strain caused by the spell is tremendous, and any damage that is deflected by the magical shield is directly taken from the caster's mana reserve. For this reason the spell should be used wisely. While there is little point in using it against weak monsters, Magic Shield has saved the life of many a spell caster when battling strong monsters that otherwise would have killed him in a second.",

        "text": "Uman-Zathroth was torn in the decision how to supply the faithful sorcerers with a suitable minion that would stand a chance in the days of war yet to come. Its dual nature made a decision almost impossible. Then his eyes fell upon a seemingly unimportant creature deep in the caverns of the mountain Kha'zeel. A group of stone golems had flourished in the magic that was seeping from the fortresses of the mighty Djinn. Their unaging bodies had assimilated more and more magic in the centuries and Uman-Zathroth sensed something else... unrealised possibilities. The godly entity subtly guided the golems to ascend the mighty mountain. Just when the stars were aligned right and another battle of the Djinn had infused a raging storm that ravaged the mountain. Not really recognizing what was driving them, the golems climbed tirelessly until the most sturdy of them managed to reach the peak. During their dangerous ascend, lots of them had ended up smashed on the steep rock face or burried by avalanches. In the end only a few of the mightiest and most self aware of the golems were left. They bathed in the raging forces, struck by lightning, both physical and magical. Again some of them perished but in the end the Thundergiants were born. Steeled by this exhausting journey to the top of Kha'zeel and imbued by mystical energies, the last creatures were chosen by Uman-Zathroth to become the mighty minions of the sorcerer. And it doesn't surprise that they are really strong and powerful, besides being faithful companions of their masters. In case of hordes of monsters the Thundergiant is a very useful bulwark protecting the sorcerer. It is said, that the most devout and skilled heroes are able to gain an intrinsic understanding of such summoning spells, that they are able mould and warp it's energies to call forth a wider array of minions, that, though identical in power and abilities better suit their own taste and style. Initially it was debated if this might be a blasphemous tinkering with a gift of the gods, a rare consensus was reached, that the ability to summon more uncommon allies is rather a deeper understanding of the will and workings of the gods and in concordance with their divine will.",

Probably due to the general knowledge that the other guilds were experimenting on that matter, a competitive race to reach that goal first had started. In the end the result was the creation of an avatar empowerment by each of the guilds.\nMost druids strife to become one with nature. To most that end is only reached when they finally return to the soil that nourished them in their lifetime. A few powerful individuals though gain the insight, self-control and power to channel nature into themselves. While at first only practicable at certain holy places where the power of nature is strong, the masters of the druidic arts learn to embrace nature so intensely that they can carry it within themselves. Unleashing this primal energy transforms them spiritually and physically.\nWhile originally meant to be a religious experience to reach further enlightenment, the transformation has an undeniable application in battle or other forms of danger.\nThough some more spiritualistic druids shunned such a misuse of nature's gifts, most readily embraced the opportunities it presented.",

Yet the powerful construct needed a soul. So the gods reached out and found a breed of firebirds that were trapped in the Pits of Inferno since aeons for the amusement of the demons. Their pligth and agony might have never ended if the divine forces had not torn down their prison and imbued their souls into their construct, merging it into a creature of overwhelming power, creating the Emberwing in the process. Due to its very long captivity it vowed vengeance to all forces of destruction. These circumstances also explain the passion and dedication with which Emberwing is protecting its master. Its goal is to raze all evil from the lands of Tibia alongside its noble master. The Emberwing is quite an elevated appearance. On first sight one might not think, that this creature is really protective, but indeed it is. The divine fire burning within the creature causes terrible damage to all its offenders. Guarding its master carefully, the summon is a faithful companion in dangerous situations. It is said, that the most devout and skilled heroes are able to gain an intrinsic understanding of such summoning spells, that they are able mould and warp it's energies to call forth a wider array of minions, that, though identical in power and abilities better suit their own taste and style. Initially it was debated if this might be a blasphemous tinkering with a gift of the gods, a rare consensus was reached, that the ability to summon more uncommon allies is rather a deeper understanding of the will and workings of the gods and in concordance with their divine will.",

While this proved to be good luck for Ferdo, it clearly showed the spell's limitations. Very few creatures and only the most distracted of intelligent beings are fooled by Chameleon, so there is no practical use for it, making this largely a fun spell.

Deep probes of the gnomes proved that there are countless lava pools, virtually brimming with lavaworms of all sizes. Though probably a very distant cousin of the rotworm, the lavaworm has little in common with its supposed relative. The lavaworm comes in several sizes but the smaller, juvenile speciems can't survive outside of their lava pools for long and the larger versions seem to loose heath too fast and are prone to become immobile stone structures until they gain enough internal heat and shed their outer stone-shell. Only the adolescent lavaworms leave their pools regularly and are herded into the armies of Those Below. They are as aggressive as many minions of Those Below, but lose interest in a fight easily and sometimes even seem to forget what they are doing. They make only weak additions to the troops as they often wander off, are easily distracted and too dumb to understand the concept of an enemy. They become somewhat more effective when they are settled to a specific area where they might serve as a kind of guard dogs or just bolster occupation forces. Gnomish intelligence suggest that lavaworms often serve as emergency rations for other minions of Those Below and that pools of lavaworms are often raided for food and resources by them. An often overlooked threat is that wandering minion armies of Those Below often leave behind straggling lavaworms in certain areas, where they sometimes settle and reproduce. So in the wake of the underground wars several new pockets of lavaworm colonies were created, that are not periodically grazed by other creatures. While gnomish and dwarfish forces exterminate any nests they stumble upon, countless hidden lava areas are already inhabited by huge numbers of displaced lava worms.",

They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve.Ogres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Although the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity. Most male ogres come in two varieties, brutes and savages. Their main task is to fight for the clan or to scout the steppe for something edible. Ogre savages favour fang-like weapons, like short swords made of stone, axes of crude iron or clubs carved out of animal horn. No less dangerous than the brutes, most ogre savages prefer weapons with an edge or blade over a club - the better to slice their enemy's belly or to bleed and weaken their fleeing prey. They love to mince their food, and taunt enemies with war cries that hint at the meashed meal the foe will be turned into.",

And some are good while others are utterly evil. The Humongous Fungus belongs to the latter category. Each of them is driven by sinister impulses of malignant evil. Even a Humongous Fungus starts out small, though. Far too small for the evil they contain, they are mischievous creatures that enjoy harassing and tormenting other creatures. They often lay simple traps for the unwary, steal things or destroy food. While a nuisance as long as they are small, the true threat arises when they grow in size and strength. If that happens, the former loners band together in groups and become a destructive force to be reckoned with. There seems little that hey fear in numbers, although they seem to not care much about a fallen comrade. With no regard for their own safety, they attack everything that promises a good deal of destruction and pain. Through their raw powers they would be a formidable threat already, additionally they also have several disturbing mushroom powers at their disposal that are usually used more instinctively then planned. It actually seems unlikely that they can control their abilities at all. Though they enjoy killing and slaughtering, they sometimes take prisoners and torture them in their lairs that they often create in some remote caves. Only there they seem to pursue their only non-evil pastime: singing. With their lovely baritone voices they are able to produce melodies of astonishing beauty. Their lead singers are usually the most humongous of the bunch. Since they are highly territorial it has become common for underground explorers to mark caves in which fungi singing was heard as a warning to other travellers.",

The Wyvern we know nowadays are the result of constant breeding of some significantly smaller, only mildly poisonous flying lizards. Over several generations, orc shamans had selected the biggest and meanest of those little beasts for breeding. Subjecting those lizards to poison and alchemistic brewages as well as constant fighting, the orcs captured and killed thousands of them. Long before the breeding cycles came to an end, the original lizard race became extinct. Originally intended to be used as weapons in wars, Wyverns proved to be too uncontrollable and impulsive to be of any real use. Finally they were used for sports events in which the orcs forced them to battle each other and other creatures. So the breeding continued for a while until the orcish society was shattered by wars and many Wyverns escaped into freedom. These new and powerful predators had no problems to survive in freedom and only their natural aggressiveness, even among each other, prevented that they became a widespread plague.Nowadays, the most aggressive Wyverns became extinct. The new breed is somewhat more sociable. Wyverns often form small packs, but since they are still quite aggressive, lethal power struggles are common, especially when it comes to leadership. Given their aggressive disposition, several Wyverns still end up in solitary.",

Like badgers, Werebadgers favour caverns as homesteads.The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

This might hint at a shift of leadership or strategy.The afflicted striders behave even more violently und unforeseeable under the influence of the parasites, yet they seem strangely more prone to acts of violence aimed purposely to be discarded as the effect of raised aggression. The suggestion that the tiny parasites are raising the striders intelligence or are intelligent themselves and acting on purpose seems a bit farfetched though. A more recent theory suggests that the parasites make the striders more susceptible to the influence of creatures such as the feared brainstealer. This would explain their existence in certain battle forces while they are lacking in others. A further, more daring theory even suggests that the small parasites are part of a hive mind and that there is one or more master parasites hidden in the depths of Those Below territory that mastermind their control. This would still leave unexplained why they are spread amongst forces in such unequal manner and the efficiency of said method would be questionable at best. Even the inflicted striders are obviously only beasts that primarily follow their basic impulses and don't express any higher strategy of some kind. Still they are a dangerous foe and even disjointed from any army are a threat to any area that they are encountered in.Though the parasites seem only to infest striders, everyone who loots items from such a creature should clean them thoroughly.",

The odd design patterns were secreted away and studied for years by the best of Rathleton's scientists. Not fully understanding the concepts they adapted the few ideas they were able to grasp and integrated them into Rathleton's machinery. Only with the discovery of glooth and glooth-based material and power the adaptation of the strange designs advanced dramatically. Still most designs still were rather crude and huge but some daring inventors dared to dream the impossible. Not truly knowing what principles they were applying they begun to rebuild some mechanisms on the excavated designs. This lead to the creation of the first machine men. These machines were first only mocked designs that had to be operated and powered remotely but again it was the glooth that proved to be the saviour. It provided not only a means to supply the automatons with power but also enabled the scientists to give them a fixed set of orders and behaviour patterns. Though not able to handle more complex situations the glooth powered golems provided significant help in hazardous areas and were suitable for heavy work. Problems arouse from the not fully understood principles that made the golem move at all though. Sometimes the golems would no longer follow their simple programs and begun to wander seeming aimlessly. All attempts of repair failed on those golems that had gone astray. Even more disturbingly, those golems begun after a while to display strange behaviour patterns as if they had some kind of will of their own or even rudimentary intelligence. Alarmed scientists dismantled the malfunctioning golems only to face increased malfunctioning in active golems. After a while the failed golems were left alone and the situation somewhat stabilized. The malfunctioning golems seemed to avoid humans anyway and even the risen aggressiveness of golems that were malfunctioning and autonomous for significant time was discarded as a necessary evil. Some inventors were inspired by the displayed aggressiveness of the free roaming golems and added defensive patterns to their order designs so that even common glooth golems are able to fend off intruders into certain territories.",

Before they join a fight, they lead the ravagers from behind, usually using a unique weapon called doomcrusher to weaken the foe from afar.Orclops Doomhaulers choose one of their own as leader. The orclops ravagers accept the elected doomhauler's rules without complaint. There is not much to decide in the simple lives of orclopses. For this reason, the main duty of such a leader is to put hunting parties together and to assign them to specific areas. It is also a leader's decision in which direction the tribe will move next. Orclops Doomhaulers inherited some of the smithing skills of the cyclopes. This makes them the primary craftsmen of their tribes. They are particularly proud of their personal doomcrushers and they spend a significant amount of time to construct and maintain them. Apart from that they create the few weapons and tools needed by their tribe. However, since orclopses prefer to live a simple life, the doomhaulers' cunning is often seen as a burden rather than a gift.Occasionally a doomhauler tries to initiate a trade with local cyclopes, but the latter usually consider orclopses as abominations and react hostilely towards them. Only very rarely, a leader of the doomhaulers manages to form an alliance with cyclopes. Such alliances are shaky at best since even the cyclopes with the best intentions find it hard to ignore the 'orcish degeneration'. Moreover, orclopses have little to offer that the cyclopes could use.It is much more common that an orc tribe is willing to ally with the orclopses. However, the orclopses usually react reservedly to such offers because of their shared past. The orcs, on the other hand, eye the doomhaulers suspiciously. They consider them as a threat to their leadership which is often based on brutality and strength - disciplines in which the Orclops Doomhaulers easily surpass even the strongest orc. Even though Orclops Doomhaulers have led orc tribes, it is a relatively uncommon scenario. Still, the rumours about it and the mere possibility prevent alliances between the two on a larger scale. The more powerful an orc warlord, the more he perceives such an alliance as a threat. Like most orclopses, also the majority of the Orclops Doomhaulers actually does not aspire more from their lives than a full stomach. Some of them participate in fierce eating contests with other orclopses but particularly with ogres.Some of the Orclops Doomhaulers began to dabble with shamanistic magic. After many years of trial and error, they have turned into the dreaded rage priests of Blog.",

Couple this with a love for fire and explosions and you get the dangerous mixture of which the pirat bombardiers consist. Whenever there is any task that involves fire, destruction and chaos, the bombardiers are the rats to be sent. And they are not shy to volunteer, as after a string of deadly mishaps before the heydays of pirat-dom, they are not allowed to handle their explosives without permission. So whenever they are ordered to employ their deadly weapons, their whole destructive potential is unleashed with glee. It is said that their favourite diet is the very cheese the green powder mold is growing on and over time the oldest bombardiers become explosive on their own. This myth is yet to be verified since the usual bombardiers behaviour isn't suited for a long live and old age. In fact the life of a bombardier is usually short and fiery. Even without bombs the bombardiers are discernable by burn marks, ashed fur and smouldered whiskers. Even without explosives at hand this pirats have a penchant for everything that burns. The most sane and stable bombardiers are employed as cannoneers and enjoy a certain amount of status amongst the crews. Other bombardiers though look upon them with disdain and have only contempt for this 'tamed fire'. In their spare time many bombardiers become cooks, although the only dish they serve is commonly coal. To some of them it's the epitome of their destructive existence, to cause as much destruction as possible in their final act and leave the mortal world in a blaze of glory. In the end they really love the smell of green powder in the morning.",

They are often seen to act as one, effortlessly moving in patterns that often mirror those of the other Swarmers.

When in a food frenzy, they are often compared to the feared piranhas.Swarmers seem always eager to collect biomass for the hive one way or the other. This often means the devouring of living matter, be it plants, garbage or living creatures. Brought back to the hive, it is stored as a putrid, half-digested mass. It is assumed that Swarmers also feed other Hive Born, particularly the kollos. Swarmers are assumed to be the most numerous of the Hive Born although not necessarily the ones most often encountered. Daring adventurers that have torn down hive constructs claimed to have found Swarmers in hollow areas and tunnels under the layers of the walls or the floors. What they have done there, remains a mystery.This is just one, even though the main strain of Swarmers that can be encountered. It seems the hive can breed another strain for defensive purposes in great numbers in a short time. Those Swarmers have an extremely short lifespan, however, often only measured in hours. In the war over the isle, the Swarmers are the foremost shock troops. They are used in great numbers to wear down opponents and to distract them from more valuable warriors. They suffer enormous casualties, although, it seems the hive's supply of them is limitless. Most casualties arise in the easy replaceable short-living strain, though, and so the losses for the hive are probably marginal.",

They are lethal predators which have a preference for human flesh. Manticores devour their victims with triple rows of teeth, leaving behind not even the bones. Therefore, the human population of Kilmaresh also calls them \"man-eaters\" - albeit on the quiet.Other than most Anuma, manticores are ferocious and savage, more wild beasts than noble magical beings. Nonetheless they are intelligent, if not as much as their benign sphinx sisters or gracious lamassu brothers. They have an ancient and lasting rivalry with the gryphons for reasons that are unknown to most mortals. Sages of Kilmaresh are researching this question for centuries but by now every story is just mere speculation. The best theory is that the manticores, favourite Anuma of the sun goddess Fafnar, hate the gryphons as they are Suon's favourite children. When Suon cast his wild sister out, the manticores accepted his sentence as all Anuma did, but bear a grudge against the gryphons ever since. Manticores roam the vast steppes of Kilmaresh, hunting for prey and defending their territories. Interestingly, they are able to interbreed with common lions. The progeny of such a mating is a special kind of very strong lions with poisonous fangs but they are rarely encountered.",

This majestic and powerful animal is a special type of lion that prefers to dwell in caves and ruins rather than in the desert. Not only are they bigger and stronger than ordinary lions, they also vary in appearance and behavior. Their fur has a golden shimmer and their eyes remind of shiny jewels. Also they act in a more intelligent way when preying and therefore are more dangerous than the customary lion. Some sages think the Roaring Lions are a sort of mystical beings from olden times because they are so often found in the ruins of ancient sanctuaries or buried temples. Whether they are the wardens of these sacred sites or were themselves a subject of worship is a secret that has still to be revealed.",

They even change their given role so quickly sometimes that an observer might come to the conclusion that Crawlers could make decisions consciously. Still, this is disputed and it seems more likely that they are only extremely sensitive to the commands or needs of the hive. Be it as it may, the Crawler can be encountered in each part of the hive and on the battlefield. They fight less aggressive and more coordinated than their brethren, though, they lack somewhat the strength of the others. They are even known for their retreats in a battle, just to regroup and attack again. Crawlers are swift and seem never to get tired. Even in futile tasks, they will not give up. Their tireless persistence is one of their most notable traits. They seem to be able to exist for an incredible long time without any form of nourishment and are one of the few Hive Born that can operate a significant amount of time underwater. As allrounder, they often aid their brethren in battles and seem to be capable fighters on their own.Speed and effectiveness are the hallmarks of the Crawlers. Their true status in the hive, however, is somewhat enigmatic. Their use for the war against the Deeplings is somewhat limited. Although some of them accompany the marching armies of the hive, most of them stay back as rear guards and to expand hive structures in gained territory. However, groups of them also accompany greater armies to harass their opponents and particularly to single out weakened targets.",

Some magicians are pursuers of the dark arts of sorcery right from the beginning of their career, others became Dark Magicians by looking for revenge or sometimes only survival after being cast out by the magic orders. Still, knowing that they are magically gifted and thus feeling superior to humanity and ordinary mortals, the Dark Magicians carve their own niches in existence. They can be found in hidden caves as well as in ruins or remote hideouts. Although usually loners, they sometimes have minions to help them with their evil schemes or serve themselves under the rule of a more powerful being. In the service of some scrupulous leader or for their own good, they pursue sinister researches and projects. In their aspiration for power, they often meet their death by the hands of more skilled adventurers.

They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve.Ogres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Although the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity. Wandering ogre shamans summon the power of the Great Hunger in self-defense or to catch prey for their rituals. Though still enormous in size, ogre shamans are no fighters as such and prefer to keep at a distance, sending out their minions to fend off unwanted acquaintances while they slink away.",

And so they prospered and became a plague for the depths of the earth, mainly invading gnomish holdings for their abundance of what the armadile consider food. As omnivores the armadile are a nuisance when encountered alone, but a threat when run into in greater numbers. Not only do they attack other creatures to devour them or destroy their food sources, their aimless digging and mineral eating often completely destroys the stability of caves and tunnels. Since there are no means to drive the Armadile out, the only solution is to exterminate them or to abandon areas with severe Armadile infestation. The main approach to identify natural competitors or threats to the Armadile have yet to meet with success. It is likely that whatever scares the Armadile off will probably be even worse itself.",

        "text": "The Dragonling is a remote cousin of the known dragons. Though sharing many traits with the dragons and sometimes seemingly getting along with each other, the Dragonling has many biological distinctions which imply that any relations to dragons are remote indeed. Above all, they share a number of traits and organs with mammals, which has led many researchers to believe that the Dragonling might rather be an artificial chimera or construct instead. Extinct creator races as well as the ancient Yalahari are named as possible origins of the Dragonlings. Whatever the real origins of the Dragonling, it is evident that today it reproduces on its own and has preferred habitats. After mating, a Dragonling lays a dozen eggs in a hidden nest at some warm or preferably hot place. It leaves the nest alone for about a year, only to return when the eggs are ready to hatch. Often it finds its nest destroyed or the eggs gone due to the actions of other creatures. If there are eggs left, they will hatch as soon as the mother is there, seemingly recognising her proximity. The young will then follow their mother who will feed and protect them for several years until they are roughly the same size as their mother. Only a fifth of the Dragonling population is male. The males will leave the clan and only seek out other Dragonlings in mating season. The females and young form wandering clans, sometimes blending with others. Membership of a clan seems more a matter of choice rather than of birth. Unlike true dragons the Dragonlings will not hoard gold, even though they are obviously fascinated by its glittering. For that reason valuable items and coins end up being devoured by the Dragonling. The Dragonlings display snakelike abilities when swallowing objects greater than their mouth would usually allow. It is known that a slain Dragonling which was sliced open was found with a complete, mostly undamaged candelabrum in its belly.",

        "text": "Some of the most ancient bonelords have gained so much power over undeath that they cross the margin between life and death. What might be considered the transformation of a living being into one of the dreaded liches, turns into something very sinister. Neither alive nor truly dead, they dwell on the border of two realms. Having mastered unspeakable techniques and twisted their own minds in ways unfathomable for other beings, they 'broke' something in their minds or rather in their souls. The part that connects each and everything to the living world is not working right in these creatures. At this step other creatures would just turn mad or wither, but some of the ancient bonelords face another fate. Through sheer will and unthinkable understanding of the thin lines between life and death, they grasp to the concept of existence. Just like they once animated their undead minions, they now keep their decaying but not really dead bodies in motion. Parts of their twisted minds are forever trapped in the realm of the dead though, captured in a constant nightmare that slowly tries to erode their sanity. To prevent the drifting off in this dream of death, they have removed parts of their skull. This way they are able to constantly stimulate their own brains with jolts of energy from their eye stalks. In a magical surgery, they have added an eye-stalklike appendage and attached a stinger to their body. It is used to leech brain fluids from helpless victims to sustain their own existence. Their central eye is sealed shut to prevent any unnecessary distraction from their inward struggle. As the central eye is normally used for bonelord communication, the Braindeath has no way to communicate with other bonelords. It relies on verbal communication which makes it disgusting even for its own kind.Their mastery of death makes them formidable opponents. Luckily, they do not often meddle with the affairs of the living. Those who for some reason cross the path of a Braindeath should be prepared for a tough fight. With little regard for its own life or that of any other being, the Braindeath will attack with an array of devastating powers that outshines every other bonelord. Commanding powerful minions from beyond the grave and possessing the resilience of undeath, a Braindeath is a nearly unstoppable force if not countered with the correct tactics.",

Spirits, soaked with decay and putrefaction, the mould phantoms are the heralds of rot. Wither is what they breathe, decay what accompanies them. They lack any true sentience, though their processing of captured souls through a disgusting version of composting, they sometimes appear to interact with their environment on purpose. This is yet only a random illusion though. The true self of the mould phantom is of a wandering zone of decay. More a natural disaster than an entity. There is some interaction between mould phantoms but this seems to follow more natural laws, shared amongst their kind and not by sentient decisions. Other such interactions are their attraction to living things. Their nature draws them to the living to spread their decay to them and share their rot. Even here they don't hurt the living on some kind of purpose but by inherent attributes of their rotten existence. They are drawn to certain places in Zarganash and though the unschooled eye see little difference in this places to other, they can be considered as Zarganash centres of decay. As such they seem to change over time, which leads to hordes of mould phantoms that migrate to new centres that they seem to sense over great distances. Such tides of mould phantoms are usually avoided by other denizens of Zarganash. Even more so, since the wandering phantoms display an otherwise unseen amount of unity in these times. If one is attacked, the attacker is quickly swarmed and usually overwhelmed by the horde, that stops its voyage until the enemy is utterly annihilated. When they reach their destination the horde quickly disperses. When a mould phantom has settled it's usually extremely territorial and does not wander off too much. That is until a new horde is formed.",

Kept in line by the promise to gain forbidden knowledge and parts of their master's power, they are just as scrupulous as their masters. Sometimes a dark magician has several apprentices and enjoys their rivalry for his attention. This way, the Dark Apprentices usually focus their scheming minds on other apprentices instead on their master. Being constantly treated badly by their masters, they use every opportunity to demonstrate their own malice over other beings. Usually more ambitious than competent, they are minor threats only. However, several apprentices that are trying to support and impress their master can still be fatal for badly prepared adventurers though.",

For the hive their purpose is probably only one - to get rid of unwanted stuff. They fulfil all their tasks with frightening precision and diligence. Their endless assaults wear down any resistance and their senses are even more keen than those of other hive creatures. They are perfect war machines that know no fear or mercy, yet, they display some cunning traits to retreat or to lure an opponent into ambushes when outnumbered or hard-pressed. The enigmatic appearance of the Spidris touches something subconsciously in the human mind and strikes fear into the hearts of those who encounter them on the battlefield. The fighting style of the Spidris is considered exceedingly cruel and unnecessarily destructive. They are known to waste a considerable amount of time to mutilate the bodies of slain enemies before continuing the fight.In the fight against the Deeplings, the Spidris are often used in the later phases. When the enemy is weakened and tired, the arrival of the Spidris on the battlefield alone may turn the tides of battle. With quick strikes and fast advances, the Spidris are most effective when fighting smaller groups of opponents whose formation has been shattered. The main body of the Spidris is usually hold back until the battle turns either in favour or against the Hive Born. Then the Spidris rush in to either achieve victory in a most gruesome and bloody manner, or they are sent to throw back the probably overconfident enemy.",

A common theory states that the Nightmare Scions are the prototype of the actual nightmare. Just like this theory, also another one assumes that nightmares do not breed, but that all nightmares come into existence through the same process. Those creatures that do not possess the full amount of power turn into Nightmare Scions. It is not known, yet if Nightmare Scions can become true nightmares by ageing or maybe by accumulating power in some way. They are usually found in the company of nightmares and seem to get along with each other quite well for demonic races.What a Nightmare Scion lacks in raw power, it tries to make up with wickedness. They are exceptionally cruel and love to prey on weaker foes. In general, they occur in great numbers to be safe. This seems not only to combine their power but also their wickedness. Nightmare Scions love to stalk their victims in the shadow for hours. Making sure they get noticed by their prey, they seem to feed on the fear they arouse. After some while, the Nightmare Scions will begin to slowly attack their victims until the whole force will swarm around the prey.

Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. The rearguard of the summer court were obviously formidable archers. Driven insane by what others of their kind call 'nightmares', these archers often forget to keep their distance, running screaming towards their targets while constantly shooting at them. Even with such erratical behaviour they should not be underestimated at all. Their arrows usually find their mark, even when not aimed at vital body parts and their disdain for accurate aiming leads to a greater frequency of shots in general. As much as they are driven by hate and anger, they seem to enjoy the blood and pain caused by their attacks. Sometimes when they kill a target they can be observed to be fascinated by the death they caused, pausing a moment in combat just to return to battle with renewed fervor.",

When being in our world, they swallow everything that is in some way edible, or can at least be crushed with their teeth. They usually start with grain and livestock or occasionally some peasant who did not get away fast enough. Then they proceed with all other kinds of animals, insects and finally plants. Finally, they stuff themselves with dead wood and other materials. Considering their incredible greed, they rarely appear in bigger packs. If anything, they form small groups.These demons are also quite knowledgeable in the arcane arts, even though they hardly use spells on their own. They are often summoned by aspiring wizards to learn from the Gozzlers. Since the little demons are not overly pleased to be forced into our world, they have to be bribed to share their knowledge. For huge amounts of food, the demons reveal little pieces of their knowledge. Many knowledge seekers have been close to the verge of ruin due to the appetite of their demonic teachers.",

This is only one of the reasons why most encountered Ice Golems are hostile. Another less known fact is that the structure of the Ice Golem's feeble mind makes it easy for all kinds of spirits to possess these creatures and to take over control. Thus the Ice Golems are easy to be 'ridden' by such entities and especially malignant spirits have little qualms to do so.The strength and resilience of Ice Golems is quite similar to other golems. They tend to be a bit faster and more agile compared to stone golems but are not that heavily armoured. They are only able to survive in cold climate as Ice Golems will melt in warmer regions unless some kind of magic is applied to prevent this. In cooler areas it is much easier to raise Ice Golems than their stone cousins. As a rule of thumb, Ice Golems are usually encountered in greater numbers than stone golems.",

Oddly enough, the abilities of the Skirmishers are quite similar to that of others, regardless of whether they serve as justice squeakers, priests of their Snake God of Death, or mushroom-eating diviners of future events. They claim to gain knowledge by consuming books of all kind. Consuming here actually means eating the books. It is deemed a fact that a Skirmisher who has eaten a lot of books is more powerful than his brethren; but whether these two circumstances are truly linked to each other is still unknown. Skirmishers employ a lot of tricks that they claim are magic, together with simple forms of alchemy and medicine, and most notably poisons. It is verified that Skirmishers use a lot of alcohol to 'magically' make Corym warriors fearless and 'mighty'. It is the Skirmishers who create the numerous charms and fetishes that are highly prized by their kin; and given the superstition common throughout the Corym society, the superior status of the Skirmishers is absolutely undisputed. Admittedly only the most cunning of the Corym make up the ranks of the Skirmishers. As their attitude is to 'support their brethren from behind the lines' and to let others finish all dirty and dangerous work, while they have the authority over the best Corym resources, they attain great ages for the usually short-lived Corym and acquire a lot of experience and knowledge. This they only impart to their minion who are trained to become Skirmishers; and it gives them an edge over the other, often somewhat reclusive groups in Corym society and ensures their leadership. Another source of the Skirmisher's influence over other Corym is their secret knowledge of cheese production. Given to them by the gods, this sacred knowledge enables the Skirmishers to work the 'wonder of cheese' and supposedly gives them access to special cheese magic. The ritual of divining the future by the smell of the sacred cheese and the devouring of the cheese by the oracle is a spiritual experience for the Corym community... and a free first-class meal for the oracle.",

The aggressive bird attacks everything that comes in its sight with rage that does indeed inspire fear and dread.

Later it became common to use them in caravans between the settlements. When Drefia was destroyed and Darashia and Ankrahmun ceased most contact due to their philosophical differences, the Dromedary breeding came to a sudden halt. Many Dromedaries were released to freedom, only to perish by the predators of the desert. Some of them survived though and revitalised the free roaming Dromedary population. For a while Dromedaries played almost no role in the settlements of Darashia, until recently, foreign adventurers rediscovered the Dromedary as mount. Dromedaries are somewhat hostile towards mankind though and are not easy captured and tamed. The biting, kicking and spitting involved in the taming makes the process somewhat tedious. Of course, it also does not help that the Dromedary itself does not behave any better than that as well. In the end, you end up with a very stoical mount, although it is rarely frightened at all. This, however, makes it somewhat difficult to induce the Dromedary to a higher speed.",

While none of these stories is actually true, they do reflect the fact that Medusae are not regarded as a natural phenomenon, in fact, that their very existence is the result of a perversion of nature. This aspect of these stories does in fact reflect reality.Recent research conducted with the help of daring adventurers has shed a great deal of light upon the origin of Medusae. It has been discovered that they are in fact elemental creatures of earth. They are, or, more accurately, were spirits of nature and earth, probably closely related to dryads. Such spirits are known to be bound to specific places. Their appearance and nature is a reflection of the place they are bound to. While this is their strength it is also their vulnerability, as, if their home should become corrupted, the nature of the spirits bound to it becomes corrupted also. This is often a traumatic event for the unfortunate spirit, and if it does not result in the spirit's death, it is likely to drive it to madness. In the process of this change, the spirit is torn free of its link to its homeland, and is released to roam the land, spreading chaos and destruction in its wake. A tragic fate with tragic consequences.The myth of the Medusa's hideousness is greatly exaggerated - in fact it is the corruption and madness that ravages the former beauty of these creatures that creates the impression of ugliness. It is certainly not the mere sight of these beings that turns living beings into stone. Medusae are capable of petrifying their victims because they are magical beings, imbued with elemental powers which are a remnant from their previous lives, now sadly corrupted like the rest of their being. Driven by their madness and an unbearable sense of loss, they cannot bear to see beauty and attempt to destroy and corrupt what was once sacred to them to alleviate the pain they are suffering. This mentality makes them the natural consorts of demons and all things evil.Sometimes demons purposely desecrate holy sites of nature to force the creation of Medusae but that process more often then not just leads to the demise of the earth spirits. Medusae themselves are much more proficient in corrupting such places while corrupting the bound spirit as well in the process. So sometimes small covens of Medusae are formed and some of them have even managed to carve themselves a niche in the demonic hierarchy.",

A good part of their enormous brain patterns are dedicated to organizing, comparing, analyzing, evaluating and memorizing new and old knowledge. They could be considered living, mobile libraries on their own. They often work in tandem with animated feathers to create new books or recreate old ones. They serve as the main copyists of Zathroth and are responsible for spreading certain knowledge while withholding other for the worthy. The guardians are zealous followers of Zathroth and as such developed their own, twisted philosophy around their teachings, so it's not uncommon for them to twist and alter texts that they produce to fill them with traps that will spell doom for the unwary and unworthy. One of their most prominent creation is that of a living, sentient runic alphabet. Those runes are able to spread like a disease amongst books and texts, change and subvert their contents and rumor has it, that it might even in some strange way may spread to sentient beings in some way. Though reclusive and more concerned about knowledge and service to Zathroth, when cornered or in service of forbidden knowledge the guardians are more then willing to engage in a fight. They use their knowledge to weave powerful spells and their only true weakness is, that they are way better in the theoretical application of their knowledge then the practical one. This leaves an opening at least for some highly skilled adventurer to weather their waves of attacks and pierce their wards and protections to overpower them. Defeating a guardian of tales though is not an easy task and surely none that pleases the god of forbidden knowledge.",

They are a mixture of plant and animal and are at least partially intelligent. Though it will not react to attempts of communication in any other way than by attacking, it is considered to be an established fact that the Swampling has some ability to react and plan ahead in ways unknown to most animals. Swamplings are known to build simple traps, set ambushes and to make use of the surroundings to kill their prey. Though it seems that Swamplings can live on water and fertile soil for indefinite periods of time, they prefer to spice up their diet with the corpses of once living beings. The Swamplings seem to prefer intelligent beings to mere animals as their prey. It is assumed that the cause for this is not necessity, but rather the Swampling's evil nature.The Swampling population in the known world has survived many attempts to purge them from certain areas or from existence as a whole by the sentient races. Even the most successful attempts have only managed to drive them back for a while though. It has to be assumed that the Swampling seeds take incredibly long to grow and lie dormant for years before they begin to sprout. Some theories assume they might mimic other plants in their growth phase until maturity and then rapidly change into their known and mobile form. There are at least no reports of Swampling saplings ever having been encountered. The Swamplings usually prefer humid areas with fertile soil but sometimes, small colonies can be found in otherwise unsuitable areas where they can prey upon intelligent beings or do them some kind of harm. Ancient reports from Darama tell about remote oases that were plagued by Swamplings who lay in wait for weakened travellers and even poisoned the water supply to ensure the demise of their victims.",

        "text": "The mist covered air over Gnomprona hosts only little diversity in wildlife. The most common occurrence is the common bat, though they tend to stay in the upper layers of the mist for some reason. There they feast on the many flying insects that inhabit the mist but in turn become the major prey to the nighthunters. The name nighthunter seems inappropriate in an area that is shrouded in a constant gloom by blowing mists and clouds. Yet for some odd reason the nighthunters prefer to strike when the local mists occasionally darken, even if only slightly. Then their level of activity rises dramatically. This might hint at a day and night cycle that might have existed in Gnomprona in a distant past, yet that leaves to wonder how and why such a thing should have existed. Another theory suggests, that a lack of light mitigated some of the irritation powers of the mercurial menaces, the nighthunters prime competitors in the skies. Some Gnomish sages theorise that in the distant past a now extinct progenitor race, related to the Naga, at one point fled from the ground, where it was accustomed to day and night cycles, into the bowels of earth where they used their magic to recreate some patterns that resembles those known from their former home. This would put other theories that much of the above ground life originated in Gnomprona upside down of course. Unlike the other airborne threat of Gnomprona, the mercurial menace, they usually prefer to hunt in the upper layers of the mist. Given the sheer number of bats, they find enough prey to rarely leave this habitat. They breed in nests at the mountainous cliffs of the volcano and their sheer numbers are frighteningly high. The nighthunters encountered on ground are only a small fraction of the real population. They are the older nighthunters that became too big and lost much of their original agility. As they became unable to compete with their younger siblings in the skies they had to try their luck in hunts way closer to ground level. There they join the plethora of other predators yet seemingly still have a higher chance of survival. The one thing that improved with their age, however, is the toxify of their spittle. While the younger Nighthunters spit is a mere nuisance lover the years it becomes more and more poisonous and harmful, providing the older nighthunters on the ground leave a formidable weapon to hunt their prey or fed of competitors.",

        "text": "While the Headpecker can survive all over Gnomprona, they seem to shun areas that are susceptible to the relatively common foul smelling sulphur clouds that are common in certain areas of the island. Their preferred habitats are located at places where the relatively constant wind drifts keep most of the sulphur away. As many other predators seem keen on feasting on Headpecker eggs, their nests are well hidden and fiercely protected. Such protection is not limited to the parent creatures but all Headpeckers. It has to be assumed that the birds can somehow sense nearby nests, even of foreign Headpeckers and instinctively act accordingly. The creature is classified as the prime example how gnompronean creatures adapted to the environment over time. By many it is seen as the source of such theories. In fact fossils of the Headpecker and its ancestors were the major starting point for the first serious investigations and excavations to begin with. Through skeleton findings and excavations it could be traced how a relatively harmless, yet enormous bird evolved to such a threatening predator. The bird-creature not only developed a quite lethal weapon in his hardened and pointy beak, it also learned instinctively to use it with utmost precision to aim at the weakest spots of an opponent. This mode of attack is seemingly aided by some strange sense to spot said areas. It's not clear if it is some enhanced form of an ordinary sense or an additional sensorial tool at their disposal. Its agility, ferocity and battle skills made the Headpecker a way more dangerous opponent then you'd expect from a mere too huge for its own good bird. The Headpecker also seem to still have taken the niche that is usually occupied by other birds and smaller mammals in other environments. Some of the aforementioned fossils strongly suggest that the Headpecker evolved from a way smaller, airborne ancestor that once roamed the skies, probably long before the rise of other flying and more successful competitors for that niche. There is a string of skeletons and bones from different centuries with whose help the development can be traced with amazing precision. The ancestor birds were not only smaller, but had way bigger wings, more fragile, hollow bones and a smaller, yet even more pointed beak. As one of the prime examples of a creature that over time developed to switch its habitat for survival it holds an important spot in scientific theories and paved the way of further archaeological excursions and theories.",

Sadly, the stone rhino is also highly territorial and easily provoked. The stone rhino sees everything as a threat and doesn't hesitate to attack. In addition to its remarkable size and strength, stone rhino is also armed with a dangerous horn on its nose which makes it a formidable opponent. With this weapon the stone rhino is able to fend off most of its natural enemies with ease. However, some super predators like dragons hunt the stone rhino for the challenge and keep its population low. The stone rhinosv prefer spots of grassland in the wilderness where they can lazily graze the whole day undisturbed. Some individuals and groups have even adapted to a life in the woods, although this only happens rarely. The stone rhino seems rather clumsy and slow when watched from afar. However, more than one explorer has been surprised by the eruption of speed and force a stone rhino can burst into as soon as it gets angry. To anger a stone rhino is not only a particularly stupid thing to do, it is also quite easily accomplished. The stone rhino may watch an approaching foreigner while slowly chewing grass, not showing any sign of unease. In the next moment it will lower its head and attack. It is advisable to give the stone rhino a wide berth. If a stone rhino attacks you, the smartest thing to do is run. Even if the stone rhino is quicker, its manoeuvrability is extremely limited, especially while attacking. For this reason, one might be able to dodge the stone rhino's attack. With some luck, the stone rhino will lose interest and give up the chase.Efforts to domesticate these creatures have not been overly successful yet. Only the ogres have had some isolated successes. These triumphs were mainly based on the ogres' strength with which they are at least partly able to domesticate the stone rhino. There are theories that the stone rhinos were created by some magician or an ancient race and that it might be related to the fabled unicorn or the chimaera. However, these theories are still to be proven. The story that the ugly stone rhino visits a hidden magical pond when it feels its end is imminent can be discounted as myth. The dying stone rhino takes a bath in this pond in the light of the full moon. After that bath the stone rhino exits the waters as a beautiful winged creature which it stays for the rest of the night, only to die in the morning. Recently hunters started to prey upon the stone rhino. There are rumours that part of the stone rhino's horn will keep the sword of an adventurer sharp and rigid. Those unfounded assertions have not only led to a decline of the stone rhino population but also to senseless injuries and the death of several unskilled wannabe hunters who underestimated the stone rhino.",

        "text": "The biting books were literally created out of the stuff of nightmares.When tasked with creating a kind of guardian dog for Zathroth hoard, his librarians came up with several fiendish ideas. Many guardian creatures were prototyped but none could impress the collective of librarians who always favoured only their own creations. Finally one of them tasked nightmares and other demons to search the fringes of the subconsciousnesses of dreaming librarians for what scared them most. The amalgam of their loot was condensed into the form of the biting book. The librarians recognized what has been done there and reluctantly agreed that this creation would suit the role fine. In the centuries since then, many of the biting books were created and trained by their new masters. Indeed they act like some sort of dog and can be sometimes even playful with their owner. Still they are dangerous beasts and excellent companions as well as guardians for the libraries. They are resilient, never sleep and despite their appearance have keen senses. They can feel the slightest vibrations of the floor, their eyes are able to see in the spectrum of magic and their tongue is able to pick up smells from miles away. They are shrewd and aggressive fighters, albeit on a primal level and they are fiercely loyal to their master. Still a few of their kind proved too aggressive for training or went mad by mistreatment. Those were chained to walls to provide a scary obstacle for intruders. The biting books only major flaw is their diet which consists of ill-written stories and poetry.",

        "text": "By far not all renegade knights are truly knights at all. Though several of them were indeed once knights that for one reason or another fell into disgrace, a greater number of them is recruited by henchmen of aforementioned knights who 'knighted' them on the field. Though in no way having a valid claim on that title, they are still called that way even by their enemies. Over time, the number of sellswords and ruffians outgrew that of the original knights, but as the degradation of the latter continued, too, often the differences vanished completely. Renegade knights tend to give their bands flashy titles and keep up the pretension of a knightly order, even though their traditions are rather a cruel mockery of the original concepts of such orders. What all renegade knights have in common is usually a lot of combat experience, regular training and decent weapons and armor. Usually, they behave no better than ordinary bandits if not even worse, depending of the ideals of their chosen 'order' which might involve torture and sacrifice to some dark powers. Though rarely encountered alone, they seldom fight in a battle formation, and prefer to engage enemies aggressively on their own, without much coordination. They usually bolster their ranks with all kinds of cutthroats from whom they pick the most suitable to be trained and equipped in order to be one day 'knighted' by them. Groups of renegade knights are often associated with some of the darker cults that suit their style and provide some amount of mysticism that pleases the vanity of their leaders, who enviously look at the true knightly orders to which in many cases they once belonged. The lower ranks are less concerned with spirituality, and care more for gold and plunder as they did before they acquired their false knighthood. Hunted by the authorities, the renegade knights usually hide in remote areas or are constantly on the move to avoid persecution. When they acquire a steady base, it's mostly done so by forcing the former inhabitants out. Such a base usually houses not only the knights but also their lesser followers and mystics of some kind. Rarely non-human allies are allowed to stay.",

By letting its opisthosoma vibrate, the spider creates a variety of sounds that are used to lure or stun its prey. In addition to other more 'spider-like' abilities, they use this sonic manipulation in a way that reminds frighteningly of intelligence and purpose. Although they can survive in some kind of hibernation for unknown periods of time, they are known to be ravenously hungry whenever the opportunity arises. Such devoured extra food is almost immediately used for reproduction, and when such a population increase used up all food sources, they proceed to cannibalism, which is mirrored in their moniker 'widow'.With the decline of the lizard empire, also the regular extermination campaigns against spider nests were stopped. This and the population growth of their favourite prey, the lancer beetle, let the number of Wailing Widows steadily increase. Strangely enough, accompanied by their growth the once reclusive spiders became more and more bold, raiding settlements and attacking far greater prey than before. It is debated if they are influenced by the land's corruption itself, or by digesting the obviously corrupted lancer beetles. Whatever theory might be correct, in the end both mean that the Wailing Widows have turned into a considerable threat to explorers of unknown areas and also to some remote settlements.",

Even amongst themselves there is a constant aggression and re-establishing of the pecking order. When left alone the diremaws constantly challenge each other to fights, though weaker devourers submit to the threats of the stronger ones and fights are averted. This aggressiveness extends to other minion races of those below and they usually leave the diremaws on their own. In battle the direwmaws are forced to work alongside each other and allies. Even then they can't supress the occasional hissing and threatening of others that come to close or steal their kill. Still they relish in combat and seem to enjoy it. The stronger diremaws are often seen in the front of assaults where they excel in spreading fear and mayhem amongst the ranks of the enemy. Their focus on aggression levels often an opening for a counterattack but the diremaw seems nit to care. Especially they seem to feel no pain at all and even try to fight when cut into pieces. Their constant fighting has honed their reflexes and trained them into fighters that are matched only by a few. The dwarfs tend to face them heavily armoured to be better protected from the loss of fingers and other body parts. Given their seemingly constant state of agitation it's amazing to learn, that they never seem to tire at all. A diremaw can fight for hours if not days and show no sign of tiring. Often small herds of them are employed to constantly scout the are around a base. Then they circle that base tirelessly at their highest speed without ever taking a break. Their whole behaviour is somewhat comparable to rabid animals and some assume that the devourer might have been drugged into this state of frenzy. The rare sightings of roaming devourers that have no connection to the armies of below suggest though, that the high level of aggressiveness is just part of their nature.",

        "text": "The vexclaw belongs to a race that was once prized as personal bodyguards and strike force of many a demon prince. The size of its vexclaw retinue determined a prince's status and rank. It is said that this fact made the Vexclaws proud and lazy. After several vexclaw troops were bribed and switched sides in one of the many inter-demonic wars, the fame of the vexclaws quickly began to dwindle. In many courts, leaders of the vexclaw guard were challenged, defeated and replaced; and the new leaders of the bodyguards sooner or later replaced most of the vexclaw forces with more capable ones. Since the vexclaws no longer were seen as status objects, their princes didn't care to object. So the vexclaws fell into obscurity for a while, shunned by other demons or even hunted for sport. At their lowest point, the vexclaws were expendable mercenaries of hell which were hired and used as it pleased the demonic warlords in their fights. Then something changed. When the demon prince Drazzak was imprisoned, his own dungeons were opened and his former prisoners released. One of them was Turaxor, whom his fellow vexclaws called the Sleeping Lord. This vexclaw was so ancient that he was rumoured to have witnessed the dawn of time. Immensely cruel and powerful, he was the trainer and mentor of all the most famous vexclaws of all times, those that once laid the foundation for the fame of their kind. He was so old that he frequently retreated and went into hibernation for centuries. In one of these hibernation phases, prince Drazzak seized the opportunity to drag the sleeping Turaxor into his dungeons, to use him as a leverage against the vexclaws as well as to stop a possible competitor for power. With the fall of Drazzak though, the still slumbering Turaxor was freed and hidden by loyal followers. When they managed to wake their lord, he was enraged. The downfall of his kind and the treachery of the prince kindled his anger. He decided to rebuild the glory of the vexclaws, beginning with a campaign of extermination of his own kind to cut off anything too weak to survive. He gathered the remaining vexclaws and led them through a series of fights, tests and hazards that only the best survived. Then he began to train and instruct them in the old ways. Step by step, Turaxor rebuilt the vexclaws that once were. Many still have more of a mercenary mentality than pride, but things are changing. No longer are the vexclaws of no consequence, and again the princes begin to look at them with new found admiration. Some princes have already reintegrated some vexclaws into their bodyguard; and the resurgence of the vexclaws has just begun.",

This unassuming creature that can actually be easily mistaken for an ordinary inanimate crystal which ironically made them prey of the Emerald Tortoises and other mineral eating inhabitants of gnomprona. Those creatures are in for a nasty surprise as the Shrieking Cry-stals are driven by a malicious, yet alien intelligence as it seems and are more than able to fight back. The level or alienness of this intelligence is not known and hard to pinpoint. With lacks of means to interact with their environment it's almost impossible to gauge such things. At least it seems highly probable that they have a limited form of communication with each other and can join forces in a common goal. Still not all predators are warded off easily and now and then a Shrieking Cry-stal ends up in the bowels of another subterranean monster. Enthusiastic gnomish crystallomancers were more then eager to study this strange creature. One of their more disturbing findings is, that the Shrieking Cry-stals are not feasting on the corpses of their victims, but a residual energy that lingers on said corpses. Though final proofs are needed it seems that the Cry-stals somehow manage to devour the spirit or even the very soul of such poor creatures. If proven true this would be on one hand a disturbingly frightening and threatening finding, on the other hand it might open up a new field of crystallomancy that allows to interact with the spirit world. For a traveller in Gnomprona though it means he has not only to fear for his life but for his very soul. The Cry-stals seem to prefer areas with occurrences of natural crystals. If it's because such environments are more suitable for crystals or there is some kind of relation to the crystals has yet to be found out. Disturbingly the dangerous Shrieking Cry-stals thrive in any environment and probably only its inability to climb in any form might have prevented their spread into the rest of the world. Therefore extreme caution is advised to move such a Cry-stal from the Gnomprona area. The gnomish science committee has put a ban on exporting the Shrieking Cry-stals and restricted any research on them for anyone but the local challenger operation.",

Sometimes in the ancient past they were found by 'those below' and cruelly enslaved by the masters of the depths. After generations of slavery and breeding, those dwarfs have lost all memory of their ancestry and culture, rendering them hardly more than aggressive animals of war. They lack a complicated language, communicating only with select gnarls and snarls. Their entire bitter lives are centred around battle and carnage. After their masters have completely broken their will, the Lost march in unquestioning obedience into battle whenever their cruel slavers order them to do so. It is hard to tell what motivation drives them. They seem not to revere to their masters in any way and show no joy in battle. The only emotion they are showing is incredible anger that rivals that of a rabid animal.",

Without noticing, their light often lures unsuspecting wanderers into the bog who mistake them for the lights of a nearby village. Wisps are rather timid and try to flee whenever a human is in sight. While trying to escape, they lure those unlucky souls deeper and deeper into the bog. In the treacherous swamps, such encounters can even end deadly.The light of Wisps is blinding and confusing if you look at it directly. They are quite fast, but whoever gets too close will experience that a Wisp's touch drains the life force from all living creatures.

Although the gnomes claim to have no useful knowledge about the ancient Shaper wisdom and technology, they were willing to share a great deal of their information about the Shapers' social structures.The Shaper Matriarch is a creature of vile cunning. They are the last keepers of oral knowledge from a time of fortune long past. They harbour an immense hatred for other creatures because they blame them for the downfall of their race. In their twisted view of the world, everything belonged to their race once. For this reason, it is only logical for them to take back what they believe is rightfully theirs. Mercilessly they punish every other race for their losses. They enjoy trapping and torturing other creatures. Very often they can be seen guiding small herds of Shaper followers to lay ambushes and place traps around their lairs. The Shaper Matriarchs are able to use ancient artefacts and fractures of once complicated and potent spells to harm their opponents. However, they lack true magical abilities, or even a deeper understanding of what they are doing.Their status amongst the Shapers is not only based on their knowledge, but also on the fact that females are a rare sight there. What is more, their ability to 'give birth' is the foundation of their influence over the simple minds of their kin.They are often the initiators and leaders of ancient rituals which are passed from matriarch to matriarch. However, with the passing of ages the original meaning of these rituals has been lost.Even though the Shaper Matriarchs are theoretically intelligent enough to converse with other races, they show no interest in doing so. Their language is unfamiliar to any known species. Although the Shapers used to interact with other races in the past, the Shaper Matriarchs are either unable or unwilling to speak the common tongue.A single Shaper Matriarch usually oversees a 'family' of roughly a dozen male Shapers. The Shaper Matriarchs are responsible for the distribution of work and resources in their groups. All males belong to her, however, the trading of males between matriarchs seems common. In less populated areas, the Shaper Matriarchs occasionally interact with each other. Usually, however, the herds peacefully tend to themselves.In highly populated settlements, the Shaper Matriarchs organise in a coven which is overseen by a grand matriarch. The matriarchs use the coven to share their wisdom and to make decisions concerning the fate of their colony. Since the Shapers hold age in high regard, the grand matriarch is usually the oldest of her kin.While the lifespan of male Shapers is usually shorter than the one of humans, matriarchs can easily reach 100 years of age. They stay fertile until the day they die. There are rumours about a grand matriarch, hidden somewhere in an almost intact Shaper structure, who even oversees the other grand matriarchs. However, as long as this has not been proven, it can only be considered a myth.",

Though in shape of little difference to other phantoms, the vibrant phantom in a spiritual sense is bloated, saturated and fat. It has absorbed many soul fragments and splinters and flourished in an unnatural way that is rare in Zarganash. But in the end the essence they devoured, bears the taint of Zarganash and unknown to themselves the vibrant soul is ultimately feasting on itself. This final atrocity, this ultimate trick, the deepest depth of the nether realm plays on them in the epitome of its perversion. Yet oblivious to their own nature the vibrant phantoms count them self to the winners in Zarganash and are at the top of the food chain. The many voices in their conscience are shoved away like annoying flies and the phantom enjoys its privilege and relative power. They actually interact with other vibrant phantoms and have built some form of community and even hierarchy. It's not uncommon for vibrant phantoms to band together in a common goal. In that way they are the most civilised of the phantoms, yet not less vile and aggressive towards outsiders. In their view Zarganash is their realm to rule and any opposition or intrusion has to be crushed without mercy. There are several 'courts' in which the vibrant phantoms indulge in the idea of hierarchy and greatness. They grant themselves imaginative titles of all sorts and even participate in royal hunts in which they hunt down randomly chosen victims. Sometimes they even take captives and hold mock trials in which they list al sort of transgressions against evenly made up rules. Such trials always end with the execution of the captive in a gruesome way. Still vibrant phantoms have one the highest levels of self-awareness of the damned and at least in theory a slight chance of redemption. Even though in the aeons that Zarganash exists not even a handful individuals are known to have attained such status, there are rumours abound and each vibrant phantom sees itself as the next candidate for greatness. Of the few that acquired that state, some found wisdom, others salvation or at least new power. The Dread Maiden is rumoured to have raised that way, but that's easy to say and next impossible to verify.",

        "text": "From all the knights that have fallen, the grandmaster has fallen the lowest and hardest. Once an epitome of virtues and skill, they have turned away and sought out forbidden wisdom or power that they valued over their former ideals. Seduced by dark secrets and lust for power that no man was meant to wield, they no longer respect what was once dear to them. Still, they value order and hierarchies and gather followers that they can corrupt to their own ways. Formidable combatants and equipped with spoils of their former exploits, they can easily overpower challengers to their leadership; and as long as they can provide their underlings with a twisted purpose and loot, they rule like they used to in their order. Sometimes they bow to a greater power, usually for the promise of even more power and knowledge. All grandmasters were pious and spiritual men in their former lives. This does not change with their fall, though the focus of their devotion is what changes significantly. With fanaticism and zeal they pursue their new dark goals and accept a life that becomes a perversion of all that was once dear to them. The new rites in which they indulge themselves are gruesome and cruel and stress their complete conversion from their past. Driven by new unholy desires, they use their followers to advance their new dark goals without restraint and mercy. Some still hold up some remote ideals of honour, but even that is often twisted and only concerns personal combat. In general, a grandmaster considers everyone as beneath his station, only making an exception for individuals of vast power. Although they are often associated with some kind of cult that promises them their desired secrets, in their hubris they don't get along too well with other cultists. Whenever possible, they try to take over the cult and rule on their own. Vile grandmasters are often bitter rivals of one another, which is especially true for members of different cults. But even when united in a specific cult, they usually get along only grudgingly. Often it takes a powerful cult leader to force different grandmasters to work together. With their skills and weaponry, enhanced through dark powers, the grandmasters are formidable foes indeed. Some of them have been brought back from the gates of death or even beyond so many times that they lost the last remains of their humanity. There is no mercy to be expected from a vile grandmaster, and he will never yield in a fight. Any would-be challenger is advised to be prepared for the worst before engaging this enemy.",

        "text": "Even the mighty Draken are not immune to the taint that spreads through the land of Zao. Some of them succumbed to the harrowing influence of the corruption. They have been disfigured in body and soul and became a disgrace for their own kind. And yet by decree of the emperor, they are still part of the society. That did not save them from the scorn of they brethren, though. Being physically even more powerful than the ordinary Draken but easily influenced by magic, they became slaves and servants of the spellweavers. The remains of their sentience is nearly burnt out by the cruel use of spell power with which they are programmed as loyal and obedient golems without any own ambitions. What is left of their sentience rarely recovers from this process, and so they roam the palaces of the dragon kings and their servants as nearly mindless drones. Their conditioning usually involves to attack anything that does not belong to the place they are bound to. If this command is triggered, the usually slow and passive Draken Abominations display a frightening amount of rage. It is unknown if this berserking is the result of the cruel conditioning process or an inherent state of mind caused by corruption. Either way, the rage amplifies their impressive strength and turns them into raging behemoths of destruction.Only a few Draken Abominations manage to flee into the wilderness, usually due to mistakes in their breaking ceremony which lead to violent escapes. Those individuals are driven by their instincts and hunt in an area until they are brought down by the forces of the local overseer.Draken Abominations that actually possess sentience comparable to that of other lizards are most likely only a product of myths. In those stories they usually serve as physically powerful helpers of those in peril, or are even involved into a tragic love story with an ordinary lizard. Given the persistence of such stories over many decades, it might be possible that there is a grain of truth in them.",

        "text": "The dream-born are a reclusive race of creatures that are shrouded in mystery. Only recent events led to a contact that shed some light on these peculiar beings. There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. The sirens of the summer court are the bloodthirsty elite of those that were overcome by the nightmares. Whatever their combat role might have been in their previous life, after they 'turned' they became a veritable threat that is hellbent on the utter destruction of an enemy. Using all weapons, spells and abilities at their disposal, they show the most tactical abilities of all crazed dream-born. Even amongst the other maddened elves they seem to command a certain amount of respect and authority for all that might be worth. They are often the leaders of onslaughts on intruders but also on attacks on the fortifications of uninfected dream-born. Don't be fooled though, they are not to be reasoned with. Any discussion they seem to engage in only has the ultimate goal to allow reinforcements to arrive or the enemy to be circled.",

        "text": "For a long time, the Broken Shapers were only a rare sight. They had been classified as a subspecies of the troglodytes, which are considered to be extinct nowadays. However, a recent breakthrough links the Broken Shapers with the once proud race of the Astral Shapers. It can only be speculated what this noble race had to endure to end like this.Having lived hidden in underground caves for centuries, they have hardly anything in common with their ancestry anymore. They have turned into physically degenerated scavengers - one could even describe them as feral predators. These wretched creatures are primitive at best, very close to losing their mind completely and turning into mere animals. The hostile environment has turned them in a similarly hostile race. They know no mercy and consider intruders either as threat or prey. With hardly any resources at hand, the looting of slain prospectors or adventurers is very important for their kind.The Broken Shapers seem magically attracted by places at which their power used to be strong many centuries ago. They look at the ruins left by their ancestors almost with religious reverence. Sometimes objects of the past replace idols or shrines in their rituals. Those who are slain and plundered by the Broken Shapers may consider themselves as lucky. Less fortunate ones are dragged screaming into the Broken Shapers' lairs to 'participate' in gruesome rites in order to appease some ancient revered artefact.Even though the Broken Shapers tend to stick to certain territories if possible, they are also a cowardly race that will leave an encampment when threatened. Then they roam the depths of Tibia until they find another hideout. It is quite common that they keep sending back scouts for several generations to find out if their old territory is safe once more.The Broken Shapers use only the most primitive tools and weapons, however, many of them are augmented with pieces of old Shaper equipment. The many centuries of unforgiving selection have turned the Broken Shapers into fierce fighters with lightning reflexes, surprisingly muscular bodies, paired with a desperate ferocity. Their senses have adapted to the subterranean environment which usually gives them an edge against intruders. However, they seem to avoid daylight and they appear to be afraid of fire and light spells.A lonely Broken Shaper will rather flee than fight. Only when they outnumber their opponent, they turn into quite fierce and aggressive fighters. As a whole the race with its few and splintered localised territories poses no big threat. They also seem to lack any ambitions. In these days in which the heritage of the Shapers gains more and more importance though, hostile encounters are increasing rapidly.",

Again others are said to be the creation of necromancers or similar dark creatures.Still they seem more accustomed to killing and fighting than several other undead. Having constantly to fear to lose their lives a whole lifetime long seems to have created some fighting instincts that are still present in their old bones.

Later lower caste lizards captured them and they became widespread pets.The Killer Caiman that is found nowadays in Zao has surpassed its ancestors in all ways.

Harpies were mentioned in some of the earliest records of human myths and sometimes are featured in the myth of other creatures too. So the origin of these creatures is shrouded in the past. Since harpies are aggressive and vile creatures that attack settlements and abduct villagers to their nests, harpies are hunted and several times in history have seemingly been driven to extinction, just to resurface out of seemingly nowhere. Over the course of the centuries there have been several attempts to replicate harpies by using alchemy or magic. The results were of mixed successes but it seems there are a couple of master formulars making the round in certain circles, that allow a reliable creation of harpies. As harpies are aggressive and destructive by nature, such experiments are usually done out of careless curiosity or with destructive intent. Only a few scientists managed to breed harpy strains that were controllable by them to at least some extend. Again Dr. Marrow had outclassed his peers in this regard, which proves that his sophisticated techniques do more than a simple fusing of creatures on his whims. Harpies are intelligent but most never get a grasp at the concept of language or build anything more sophisticated than simple nests. Even the usage of tools is rare yet not unseen amongst harpies. Though there are some loners amongst them, most harpies prefer to band together in flocks that claim wide Swarts of land as their own territory in which they hunt indiscriminately and that they fiercely protect. Their common tactics against significantly smaller enemies is, to lift them into the air and drop them to death from a greater height. They try these tactics even on larger opponents. Though this proves ineffective, their nasty, sharp claws sill are able to cause grievous wounds during such attempts.",

Their twisted vision and mind result from dangerous home-brewed alcohol and make them a threat to everybody, including themselves, when they roam the dark alleys of the cities they live in. They are neither impressive fighters nor do they have good equipment, but their madness gives their gaunt bodies frightening physical power and resilience. They become particularly dangerous to travellers when they appear in a group led by an invisible hand. Even though, an adventurer might rather want to mourn these pitiful beings, he will quickly raise his weapon when he is attacked with sticks, clubs, stones and teeth. Regardless of their own safety and with the fury of a madman, they might not pose a real threat to an experienced fighter, but their attacks can be fatal for an ordinary citizen.In their few sane moments, they travel much, so they can be encountered almost everywhere. Some cultures, which are usually hostile towards humans, praise Crazed Beggars as blessed beings. In rare cases, it has also been reported that one of them started to see his madness as divine providence and start to form small cults of equally mad cultists. Created by a mad mind, such cults can be devoted to almost anything, from mundane objects to completely deranged philosophies that only a madman can understand.Even without a leader or a common goal, Crazed Beggars often team up led by an instinctive need for protection and company. Astonishing enough, they seem to get along with each other quite well, most likely as they are all absorbed in their own mad worlds.",

        "text": "Drillworms are aggressive beasts from the depths of the earth. It is assumed that they are a distant relative of the common rotworm, but no medical examination could prove this. In fact, studies have revealed that the Drillworm is, in fact, quite different from the rotworm regarding its movement, behaviour as well as its organs. It possesses two powerful legs which, in some circumstances, may also serve as arms. The Drillworm's set of teeth is only a secondary tool compared to the highly corrosive acid in its mouth, which serves as both saliva and digestion fluid. While the teeth usually are used to crush or get hold of something, the acid is used for quickly dissolving earth and stone, transforming it to a mud-like mass that can be gobbled up by the Drillworm, thus allowing it to pass through. The body of a Drillworm is quite resilient, despite its colourless, almost translucent skin through which its massive muscles can be seen. Although blind by normal standards, its eye-like organs are highly effective heat sensors, and its antennae, which are usually feeling the stone surfaces, can sense even the most slightest of vibrations. These organs grant the creature extremely sharp senses, giving it an edge in any subterranean environment. What is more, the Drillworm can retract the spikes on its tail and extend them so forcefully as to make a most effective anchor of it. Using this natural anchor, and forcefully twisting its body, the Drillworm sprays the stone in front of it with it corrosive saliva. Releasing the pent-up force of its twisted body in order to rotate forward at high speed, the beast puts itself into an actual drilling motion, enabling it to pass through the most massive barriers at frightening speed. Because of an obvious lack of predators and challenge in its natural habitat, the Drillworm is quite bold and, while not aggressive as such, still sees everything as food. Alarmingly, to the single-minded beast the movement and heat patterns of other living beings apparently indicate a favourite type of food, causing the Drillworm to attack. Only recently, Drillworms have emerged from the depths of the earth and are now to be found in layers that are already inhabited by the known underground-dwelling races. If the migration of the Drillworms continues, they might soon replace the known rotworm populations, as the rotworms pose no threat to the Drillworms and occupy quite a similar niche. Probable reasons for this migration are the rise of the heat and lava levels that can be witnessed all over the world, and which the gnomes refer to as 'global warming'. In light of these facts, not only an increase of Drillworm sightings is to be expected, but also the appearance of other subterranean creatures; and if the drillwom is to be any indicator of their threat level, this is dire news indeed.",

Conditioned Cyclops Drones usually attack on sight. Fortunately, they hardly seem to understand what they are doing and therefore rarely use the full strength of their imposing arms. Still, the sheer force of a thoughtless blow can crush bones and break weapons and armour. Cyclops Drones are not numerous, and as they are also not much valued among the cyclops, they are usually found deep underground working under supervision of other cyclops.",

The Earth Elementals seem mindless, guided only by some mystic field that spans the whole world according to the followers of Crunor. If an Earth Elemental is disconnected from this field, it becomes increasingly violent and destructive. It starts a rampage that eventually will lead to its own destruction. However, even the Earth Elementals that are connected to this field are by no means peaceful creatures. They follow a universal instinct that often leads to conflicts with living beings. The ultimate goal might be to bring some kind of universal balance; but to achieve this goal, much violence is used, relying on the enormous strength and resilience of the Earth Elementals.",

Inspired by the rebellious amazons of Carlin, some young and restless elven maidens founded a sisterhood of their own. The futility of their protest against the rigid elven society and its rules soon drove them to foolhardy dangerous ways of protest that bordered on criminal acts and put them in danger of becoming outcasts. In a desperate attempt to hold her sisterhood together, their leader Emana Greenskull staged the theft of several amphora with the waters of Ashar'tel, branding the sisterhood as outcasts, thus binding her followers to her by denying them the option to peacefully return to society. With little knowledge about the water but convinced it contained power, Emana and her sisters drank from it. At first they truly felt the surge of power they expected. But the water became like a drug to them and slowly changed their very nature, mutating them into something else. Convinced that the voices they heard in their intoxication were revelations from nature itself, the sisters embraced their change and even enforced it. The change however left them mutated not only in body but also in mind, and after the last water was used up, and symptoms of withdrawal began to torture them, the remaining sisters were completely driven into madness. Renaming themselves to forest furies, they see themselves as the chosen of nature, enacting its revenge on the people misusing it - which is, in their twisted thinking, almost everyone but themselves and a few allies. The furies are unpredictable but hateful. They can not be reasoned with, and the best one can hope for is that they are so absorbed in some holy mission that they simply ignore anything else. The most ferocious and strongest of the forest furies bear the honorific 'Elder' and often charge themselves with guarding anything they see as sacred, attacking hapless trespassers. In battle the furies employ not only the physical force of their changed bodies, but also a variety of druidic spells, which are strangely enough often intuitive abilities rather than spells, and are unknown to other users of druidic magic.",

There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. Of all the dream-born who fell prey to the nightmare, the sirens of the winter court retain the most of their original intelligence, abilities and beauty. All the more they are by far the most dangerous of them. Seemingly having accepted their nightmarish visions as reality, they indulge into their madness and become scions of carnage and pain. The only pleasure they know seems to come from the destruction of all that was dear to them in their former lives. Their eerie form of insanity bestows them with a certain aura that even their maddened kin can perceive and that commands their respect. It's a fearsome sight when they command a horde of ravening mad ones with a slight gesture of a finger into a frenzied attack only to join them screaming and slashing within a heartbeat.",

Both, the orcs and the lizard people, consider the Terramites as delicacies.Usually the Terramites are content with the things they find in the underground but if the colony is starving, some scouts are sent out to look for more fertile areas. They consider each and everything they find in the earth as potential food, and the unlucky fellow that curiously explores one of their mounds, learns soon enough about their warlike welcome for any intruder.Unlike other insects, Terramites are generalists and lack the distinction between workers, warriors and queens. This makes it rather difficult to extinguish a colony. It is unknown what - instead of a queen - holds a colony together, but a Terramite colony seems to run effectively even without a leader.",

        "text": "The ruthless individuals known as grave robbers roam abandoned crypts in search of riches. They do not like any form of competition, infights and backstabbing are part of their daily routine. Though these fights are forgotten as soon as another competitor enters. So, often surprised adventurers and explorers end up earning the wrath of the grave robbers. In rarely seen unity they put aside their quarrels and team up to eliminate the unwanted intruders. The grave robbers fight with all the cruelty and spite at their disposal. They are usually not well armed or armored, carrying around an assortment of stolen ragtag equipment. Usually recruited by a twist of fate from the ranks of the poor and hopeless, the common grave robber fears little and has respect for nothing. Though some of them might be tragic individuals, hoping to support their families or having caught some bizarre disease when investigating an ancient tomb, the majority of them are a bunch of thieves and murderers of the worst kind. Most of them have abandoned all initial hope of finding a fortune and settling down long ago. Having not much to loose and having given up all pretence of self respect, they have no honour and know neither remorse nor mercy.",

Huskies are a prized possession and the Husky breeders are eminently respectable. The best of those dogs are nearly invaluable to their masters and even the chance to use a dog sled now and then is seen as great sign of trust and a great honour. Playful and curious, Huskies roam the streets and camps of the northmen, some are even trained as watchdogs. Huskies are almost exclusively encountered in the company of men and it's doubtful if they were able to survive on their own.",

As master of stealth and surprise, it strikes from the shadows, unexpected and deadly. The death of the victims were usually associated with one of the many other dangers of the jungle. Only a daring expedition of the Explorer Society that tried to uncover the myth of the Midnight Panther brought home proof of its existence. Many members of the expedition paid this discovery with their lives. As living myth, the Midnight Panther is attributed with many magic abilities and skills. Given the short and violent confrontation of the expedition with a Midnight Panther, none of those claims could be verified. For this reason, many facts concerning the Midnight Panther are still only speculation. All that can be taken as a fact is that the Midnight Panther is extremely rare, reclusive and dangerous.",

The only thing that can be said with some certainty is that feversleeps are somehow related to the terrorsleeps, in whose company they are often seen.Feversleeps emit a strange, sweaty heat. When victims draw near, feversleeps often cloak themselves in shadow, becoming invisible, detectable only by their foul stench and a strange weakening effect they have on their prey, distorting their prey's sense of time and draining its powers so they can feed on it.Feversleeps love cool water, and are often seen next to pools or rivers, preferably underground in a dark and dank cavern. They have been seen mainly in Upper Roshamuul and are maybe attracted to ruins of ancients settlements, or may have had another purpose when the ruins were still inhabited. However, no one so far ever ventured to investigate closer, as the feversleeps are a promise of a slow, horrible end in the throes of deathly hallucinations, for all that stay too long in their vicinity.",

The Sandcrawler can endure extreme climates and periods of starvation with ease. They are not overly aggressive but they also know no fear. When they focus on one thing, their efforts are relentless and untiring. They usually do not prey on bigger creatures, and there is no aggression in their attacks, just frightening determination. Since they do not build huge colonies but rather live in small groups, it is wise to destroy each nest entirely to prevent further spreading of these creatures. Although they usually live in sandy areas, they often also move to more fertile areas. In their recklessness, they often cause much harm, and only a few Sandcrawlers can destroy a whole field.",

The phantoms that gave in to arbitrariness of almost obscene proportions are known as capricious phantoms. Their very existence is a contradiction and their presence is a pain to reality itself. What might be seen as aimed attacks are just manifestations of their unnatural state. Especially the human mind that tries to make sense of the mockery their presence causes, tend to actually see behaviour patterns and actions of the capricious phantom that are not really happening, just to make some sense of the hurtful confrontation. In reality the capricious phantoms are not existent at all. The concept that is hard to grasp for the mortal mind is, that they are kind of a blind spot in reality. An occurrence probably only possible in the twisted realm of Zarganash. These non-entities and their perceived actions are just a trick the mind plays, to cope with that what can't be understood or observed. Of course the results of their presumed actions are very real, even if caused by something entirely different than observed. In the end it makes little difference for a victim of the capricious phantom. Whatever it is or not has to be dealt with or it will cause damage and destruction. Luckily the occurrence is susceptible to normal weaponry and responsive to spells. So for many travellers the nature of the phantom is a moot point, they handle it like any other hazard, since at long as it can be 'killed', it's good enough for most.",

In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.Werehyaenas are sly and tough, yet not too strong or coordinated. They are predators as well as carrion eaters and their appearance is a mix between a hyaena and a human being. Like hyaenas, Werehyaenas favour warm savannas and deserts as homesteads and are aggressive and cunning.Other than Edron's and Cormaya's werebeasts, the werehyaena packs of the Darama Desert are known for having shamans in their ranks. They use simple bone talismans to cast spells that could somehow be connected to undead powers.The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

It is certain that their behaviour usually does not change much due to the mutation other than becoming more daring. Rumour has it that depending on their sources of food - the disgusting details will be left out here - they might get frightening intelligent and live much longer than usual rats. Mutated Rats always take the leadership over the common rats in their area. Being the leader, the Mutated Rats rarely leave the deepest lairs but are served and fed by their smaller brethren. In combat they are rarely seen without the company of ordinary rats that seem to serve as their soldiers. They are definitely more powerful and even vital than their smaller kin but they are still not much of a threat for an experienced fighter.It is also said that some of them actually become immortal and gain magic knowledge from devouring whole books about magic. Those Mutated Rats are actually able to learn certain rat related spells and become powerful ratomancers.

Being worse than beast or demon, it combines the most fearsome and most dangerous traits of both kinds to an amalgam of fearsome power. Containing the malice and ferocity of three demons, the Hellhound uses the malignant abilities of its three heads to cause as much damage as it can.Said to be three times meaner than the average hellbeast, its three heads are so frightening in their hellish rage that lesser men are said to have died already on sight of this walking menace of ichor and fangs. Sometimes one of these demon beasts is captured and trained by powerful demons to something that could be vaguely called a forced loyalty to their fearsome masters. As long as they respect their masters as the stronger one, they are relatively obedient. Still, nobody can tell when they might turn on their master or when they are driven into a frenzy that let them forget any bonds they might have shared. Hellhounds are known to get in such a rage that they not seldom heavily wound their own heads. Still large numbers of those beasts are bred and captured on order of several demonlords. They are as often employed to frighten an enemy or a rival as they are used as a status symbol to prove their might and disregard of danger ... and the lives of their other minions as well.",

        "text": "The Grimeleech is a strange breed of demon that only recently surfaced. It seems that there was once an ancient demonic progenitor race of lesser demons which infested the demonic realm like vermin and survived on the garbage of higher demons. In the last few decades, this lesser demon vermin seemingly vanished completely and instead, the Grimeleech surfaced. Some self-proclaimed experts on demonology and zoology claim that the Grimeleech is somehow connected to the Hive creatures, but even they heatedly debate whether the Hive in some way infected the demons, or whether the demons absorbed some of the Hive's attributes. It is undeniable though that the Grimeleech breed soon left its mark in the ranks of demonkind. Especially their ability to harmoniously work together is a trait rarely seen in demons. The vast number of Grimeleeches spread out into different swarms led by powerful matriarchs. In something resembling a forced evolution, Grimeleeches grew significantly in power and importance in the demonic ranks. Other demons eye them suspiciously, and while some will not accept them as true demons at all, others are more concerned with where and when the Grimeleeches' increase in power and abilities might end. However, Grimeleeches usually stick to their own and mind their own sinister businesses. They inhabit the more unpleasant, least contested spaces in the demonic realms, and are highly territorial. Only recently some demon lords have recognised their potential and tried to integrate them into their forces; and others soon followed so as not to leave a potential weapon solely at their rivals' disposal. The Grimeleech matriarchs seem unconcerned about sending some of their troops to assist the demonic leaders, if only for the fact that the little time and resource it costs to replace some fallen soldiers is of small consequence to them. The birth rates of the Grimleech can swell to enormous numbers if required by the matriarchs. How the demons really reproduce is shrouded in mystery, though. In combat, they show little regard for their own health and try to cause as much damage as possible. While the ordinary Grimeleeches seems to have little personality, and no ambition beyond serving their matriarchs, it would be wrong to say they enjoy the carnage and bloodshed they are often involved in. Instead, they are just frighteningly unconcerned and highly efficient. These facts make the Grimeleech a force to be reckoned with; and one that might further shake and change demonic society.",

By 'riding' this storm, the elemental becomes more substantial and significantly dangerous.Hurling mighty energy attacks and being almost insubstantial, Energy Elementals are extremely dangerous. They have some intelligence and actually enjoy blasting their enemies with powerful lightnings. Energy Elementals can be encountered almost everywhere, as they can spawn at any place that contains some air. Their main attacks are lightnings and forceful gusts of wind, but they can also cause some form of suffocation. Almost as fast as lightning, it is hardly impossible to escape from an Energy Elemental unless it is temporarily destroyed. It can regenerate itself by drawing air from the surrounding area. Capricious as a storm, it is very unpredictable in combat and even experienced adventurers can hardly foretell how an Energy Elemental will behave.",

Though Goblin Assassins are hardly anything else than 'wannabe assassins', they are indeed the most tricky and cunning of their kind. They use everything at their disposal for fighting including dirty trick. They enjoy stealthy attacks and the use of paralysing poison to eliminate their enemies. Amongst their kind, they are revered as heroes. They often hold high positions, gained by trickery to get rid of other contenders for leadership. Every goblin chieftain has a bunch of assassins as close advisors. Since the king knows that his advisors would gladly stab him in the back to succeed him as chief, he plays a difficult game of playing off the Goblin Assassins against each other and sending them on suicidal missions to get rid of them. So, being a Goblin Assassin is a mixed blessing. It is desirable as it ensures a position of power which all goblins long for. At the same time, it is a threat for a goblin's life.In battles, Goblin Assassins try to be as effective as necessary to keep their position and as inconspicuous as possible to avoid the attention of both, their opponents and their fellow assassins. To some extend, this restricts the assassin's effectiveness, though when under pressure, he usually plays out all of his tricks to either flee or to kill his opponent.",

In the camps, older Goblin Scavengers sort out the loot the raiders and warriors get into their hands. The younger Goblin Scavengers are sent out into the wilderness to loot and plunder everything they can get. Usually they form parties that sneak about the lands of their enemies and try to get as much loot as possible. It is said that the loot bag, still very popular among modern adventurers, was an invention of Goblin Scavengers.When surrounded by enemies, they try to keep a distance and to attack from afar. Since Goblin Scavengers are usually seasoned scouts, they also possess some knowledge about the wilderness and plants. This enables them to poison their weapons with a moderate effect.You never know what kind of loot a Goblin Scavenger might dig up from his pockets. It can be everything from a rune to much more valuable items. Goblin Scavengers occur either alone on a mission as a scout, in small groups of two or three, or as a band consisting of up to two dozens.",

On the other hand, you find demonic entities that want to spread havoc in the world of the living. Both forms are actually spirits that have entered dead or living trees.Haunted treelings attack every living creature on sight, either out of spite or to seek revenge. It is likely that a man and a minotaur look alike for Haunted Treeling and that so one race has to suffer for the mistakes of the other. In rare cases it is possible to calm the nature spirits if showing respect for nature, the demonic form, however, can at best be bribed to stop attacking. Some woodland communities have developed some form of coexistence with both forms. Other villages live in fear of these malicious creatures.Haunted Treelings can easily be mistaken for normal trees which makes it easy for them to ambush their enemies. Slaying their tree form will only result in chasing the spirit out of its wooden host, but actually does not harm it at all. They are exceptionally strong and know neither pain nor fear.",

        "text": "The so called rot elemental is of course out of the scale of normal elemental classification. Though it shares several attributes with other elementals, it lacks other distinctive features and instead has in those areas more in common with spirits or even the undead. As a matter of fact, the existence of rot elementals is another phenomenon, connected to the necromantic smog of the Rathleton area but it could be encountered at other sites that were soaked with necromantic energy at one time. Actually the ghostlands and the plains of havoc are places that have seen at least manifestations of such creatures although up to today none of them endured for a longer time. So there are obviously other facts at work in the creation and stabilization of rot elementals. As far as modern science knows, the elementals are created at sites with a considerably number of waste and carrion. This fact is disputed by the theory that the manifestation just seeks out the greatest concentration of such matter rather than needing a certain amount of it. Be it as it may, some kind of spirit is drawn to such places and makes itself felt by and overwhelming presence of decay. Mould grows extremely fast and matter decomposes in exceedingly fast rates. It's like the spirits presence would dissolve suitable matter to use it for the creation of a host body. Several tests indicate that the spirit does not really inhabit this body but rather 'rides' it, in some way using it like a puppet. The controlling spirit seems quite primordial and not a specific spirit of a person or entity. It is more a certain instinctive consciousness that seems to inhabit certain necromantic fields and that is sometimes bound by necromants to inhabit and animate dead bodies. In the case of the rot elemental this consciousness is acting on its own. This it why it's called a rot elemental at all, it manifests spontaneously, has a certain consciousness on its own and is built of a specific 'element'. As the elemental classification, despite certain efforts, does not count necromancy or rot as elemental power and the purity of rot can't be measured as well as the presence of at least some considerable part of fluid, that would be counted as another element, is present, it seemingly defies too many rules to be scientifically counted as elemental. Of course the provisionally nomenclature as spontaneous necromantic physical manifestation was never popular enough so that the name rot elemental stuck to the creature anyway. As for its behaviour, it's considered as mindlessly malignant as its only driving motive seems to be to spread death and pain without any greater plan. Sometimes rot elementals are controlled via variants of spells that are meant to control the undead, but even such altered spells are of high risk and the elementals are known to break free in a frenzy.",

All of them combined their knowledge to create their own loyal servants. Several prototypes were made. Some constructed of metal, others of gold or even diamond but all of them were based on flesh and bone. The Golden Servant in particular could be considered as the master pattern. Most of the creatures the mages constructed afterwards were based on this specific design. Some of them were faulty from the start.

        "text": "This hunting Spider doesn't build intricate webs but in the past usually dug itself into the ground, to suddenly spring up, when alarmed through ground vibrations and drag their prey into their lairs. For these hunting tactics they earned the moniker 'Undertaker' by the first explorers to encounter them. With the more active volcano and earthquakes their sense for prey has become widely disturbed and they have mostly left their hidden lairs to freely roam the lands in search of prey. It has yet to be seen how this change of behaviour becomes their species as a whole and if its a viable tactic to survive. What can be said already, is that they became aggressive roaming predators that now are an even greater threat to all creatures in Gnomprona than before when their lairs could be spotted and avoided by keen senses. They are quite adapt at fighting which hints that their trap hunting habits were mostly a matter of convenience and less of necessity. Easily able to put up a fight, the Undertaker can compete with the other gnomepronean creatures eye to eye. Their underground lairs are not completely abandoned and they are still maintained. However, they now only serve as refuge, storage for excess prey or hiding spot for their eggs. Like squirrels, the Undertaker sometimes 'forgets' its current lair and builds a new one. Despite its hunting habits the undertaker still utilises some form of webbing which can be used spontaneously as a weapon. As the camouflage of the webbing that makes it look like a mixture of vines and roots has no apparent advantage, it's assumed that the undertaker in some distant past more heavily relied on local webs and its appearance as ordinary plant life, before moving to underground hunting lairs. This suggests that the undertaker is currently adapting for at least a third time to new behaviour patterns. This lets one wonder if this holds true for other gnompornean creatures, too or if such an adaptability is more something closely related to the undertaker per se.",

It is argued whether this bug is the product of corruption or rather drawn to it. As a matter of fact the Brimstone Bug actually feeds on the corrupted essence of the world regardless of its source. They are drawn to places of dark magic or magical devastation. They are also known to devour residues of undead and demonic excrements without hesitation. Like certain flies are drawn to physically rotten things, the Brimstone Bug is attracted by things that are spiritually rotten. Not only does such matter no harm to them, it also seems to fuel several unusual powers of the Brimstone Bug. Only occasionally though, they display their magical powers which are unpredictable but harmful. Even though corruption is their preferred kind of nourishment, the Brimstone Bugs are not above attacking uncorrupted beings. If not starving, the bug will carry its dead or helpless prey to a place of great corruption and wait for the victim to become contaminated by the taint. Then it will finally devour it.Brimstone Bugs live in swarms of different sizes even though they are quite aggressive among each other and fights are common, brutal, and often lethal. The Brimstone Bug is cannibalistic and will devour any fallen swarm member. However, if they can choose, they will devour corrupted prey first, which makes those theories less likely which claim that the Brimstone Bug itself is a result of corruption.Sometimes colonies of Brimstone Bugs form in seemingly uncorrupted areas. The truth is, however, that the bugs only eat the corruption faster than it can grow back. So exterminating a colony might prove even worse than the bugs itself because without the bugs the corruption might spread even further through the land.",

        "text": "It is hard to say when sightings of the Yielothax were first recorded. The creature seemed so bizarre and fantastic that encounters with them probably were dismissed as feverish illusions. That is when such an encounter was survived at all. It is safe to say that the Yielothax are not native to our world. They usually enter our world due to bizarre magical phenomenons, often the result of careless spell casting experiments. Sometimes dimensional travellers encounter them in what was perceived as their home dimension. Newer researches suggest that the Yielothax are an invasive life form that not unlike a swarm of locusts invades and occupies other dimensions or planes of existence while annihilating all native life. Since they change the environment in a certain way, it was often assumed that travellers meeting Yielothax in their 'native' habitat were visiting the same dimension. This was proven wrong by new scientific methods and insights, though. There are heated debates whether the Yielothax is more like carrion eaters, invading dimensions that have become weakened and fading, or if the Yielothax are the reason for the fading of those dimensions. Whatever theory might be true, it is a fact that dimensions in which the Yielothax are encountered in mass become more and more unstable and finally unreachable after a while. It is currently unknown if there is (still) such a thing as the Yielothax' home dimension at all. The Yielothax are very territorial and extremely aggressive to any non-Yielothax life forms. They can reach a surprising speed and attack rapidly, trying to rip their opponent apart. The Yielothax are omnivorous in the truest sense. They eat virtually anything. There are verified reports of Yielothax eating substances like rock, tar and even magic walls. Even if the Yielothax are probably sentient beings, they seem unwilling to communicate with any non-Yielothax life form. Since the rare cases of Yielothax sightings in our dimension are the forerunners of an impending invasion, everyone who encounters Yielothax in our realm is asked to report this to the scientific authorities immediately.",

Though the gnomes claim that no conventional magic is a work, it is hard to believe that only sound resonances and light is involved in controlling and animating the golems.

Especially seismic activity can disrupt their control melodies and might turn them into a threat for gnomekind or anyone they might encounter. Golems are physically strong and durable. They can easily withstand great punishment and stress and will never tire. The gnomes usually use them for peaceful labour and for carrying great loads. The gnomes claim that the golems are only good for battle if there is dire need for reinforcements, since they still lack the correct battle melody that would enable the golems to use their full potential. In spite of this the golems are not to be underestimated. Even when not using their full potential, they are hardy warriors and great combatants. The gnomes have already created some special battle golems with different shapes and armaments. As long as they lack the correct melody however, the project is on hold and the golems are just gathering dust in some remote caves.",

They can also control their transformation and consciously turn into their werelion form or back into human shape. Gradually, the werelions got so used to the curse that they saw it as a gift rather than a burden.

Although they often take on a seductive appearance, they show their true form as soon as there is no need for charade. In this case they appear as tall, beautiful women with four arms, fangs and glowing eyes. These demonesses are driven mainly by greed and envy. They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. There are several kinds of asuri. The dawnfire asuri have tanned skin and black hair, favouring clothes in the colours red, orange and yellow. They are associated with fire and energy and prefer to use magic rather than weapons.",

The Troll Champions receive their title mainly for their slyness and brutality. Raising in status seems great in the beginning but it quickly becomes a matter of survival. Even though cowardly, most trolls are incredibly greedy and envious. As a result, a troll with a special status has to fight for its life and to survive many attempts of backstabbing or arranged accidents by its brethren. Of course, every Troll Champion abuses shamelessly his privileges in his tribe. Therefore, it is only natural that a Troll Champion has to constantly watch his back and stay as fit and well-equipped as he can manage. This again makes him one of the toughest fighters of the tribe that other trolls turn to when in danger. Troll Champions are usually the leaders of small raiding parties or the personal bodyguards of the equally abusive chieftains. They love to bully weaker trolls and are hardly encountered without some henchmen that they can bully around and sacrifice in battles.",

A calculated malice seems to guide them all and their evil intentions are too obvious to be dismissed as random actions. Their malleable forms are elusive and unstable, so guided by their inherent evil, they choose another form to confront their victims. Legends of Zarganash tell about a time when the mirror images walked the realm like gods and took the shape of whatever their intended victims most desired or feared most. At some point in the distant past, however, something happened. Be it a shift in the flows of power, the intervention of one of Zarganash's most powerful denizens or something else completely, no one can tell. Whatever the cause has been, the powers of the mirror images were greatly diminished. Still cruel and dangerous they were only a mere shadow of their glorious past and their shifting powers only included a far lesser array of horrible shapes. Some obscure texts seem to claim that the mirrored images can be summoned through blasphemous rituals, even into the mortal realm. Such rituals should be able to force the image into certain forms of manifestation, chosen by the summoner. Such claims are lacking verification yet and the fact that other denizen of Zarganash are bound to the realm in their core it seems somewhat unlikely that such rituals exist or could be easily and reliably performed at all. In Zarganash itself the mirror image it's power level is nowhere as near to the legends of their past. Still they are dangerous opponents that use their shape changing powers to at least some extent to gain an advantage. It is said that no one ever saw the true form of a mirror image and even that they are somehow locked out of their true form since their downfall. While mirror images have perished their overall number seems not to be affected by this. This leads to the assumption that for all their enigmatic qualities they are somehow also bound to the damning circle of destruction and recreation that has many denizens of Zarganash in its grip.",

The sheer appetite of the devourer seems absurd to a level that borders magical abilities.

This lead to over the top tales of dwarfish explorers that assume that the individual devourers are just remote parts of a bigger organism that is magically connected to them and feeding on all that his remote maws devour. Wherever these stories came from, they have spread through the dwarfen troops and handled as common knowledge. There is yet no scientific evidence of such claims and attempts to capture a devourer only lead to the entrapped devourer turning it inside out, devouring itself, so to say and dying. Devourers diet seems to contain of everything. When left alone they devour minerals, though they don't tend to burrow tunnels while eating and rely instead on loose rocks. Given their appetite, it's remarkable, that they actually can concentrate on battle when needed and put their hunger aside for a while. When the battle is done though they scour the battlefield for corpses and everything that is too wounded to fight back. The dwarfs that fought them the most have another tale about them, claiming the devourers developed a special taste for rust and seem to see it as a delicacy.

One of the lowest casts are used as a kind of dumpster for unwanted and disturbing thoughts and emotions. Those unfortunate squids are forcefully filled with thoughts and emotions that are no their own. Picked from the ranks of the weakest and most instable of the squid race they soon fall victim to madness while their minds are more and more shattered. Even in this state the broken being, no longer comprehending what's happening to them are further used and flooded with foreign brain patterns. A good part of the caste withers away and dies in the process. Some though mysteriously manage to survive. Over time their own frustration and anger adds up with those that are dumped into them and this dangerous mixture is only contained by a more and more fragile mind. Sooner or later those minds just snap. This is usually noticed by their handlers far in advance and the unfortunate creatures are extracted to undergo a gruesome procedure to alter their minds and brain pattern. After all the lobotomys and inductions there is little left over then an animalistic creature that follows predetermined patterns like a golem. These creatures, known as rage squids are highly aggressive and violent and their only use is to employ them as a kind of guard or attack dog. Often accompanied by a handler, they are used in packs for war or hunts. Tempered by violence and aggression their former meager fighting skills become formidable by their training and conditioning. Only recently rumored shifts in the society of squids lead to a dramatic increase of rage squids produced. Because of this rage squids are now sometimes employed for very specific guarding tasks without any handler present.",

        "text": "The discovery of the hulking behemoth sent shockwaves through the entire scientific community. Especially it's unique bone structure turned many things taken for granted upside down. Many of the bones that were found in the deepest caves and the bowels of Tibia, for years have been assumed to be the fossilized remains of the modern behemoths. Yet the recent discoveries in Gnomprona now hint that they rather belonged to the hulking behemoths that once seemed to have roamed the whole depths of Tibia. It now seems likely that the hulking behemoths arose in times when food was abundant in their native underground habitat. Later when such sources of nourishment became scarce, they were slowly replaced by their more specialised mineral-eating children. Unlike his descendant the ordinary behemoth, who adapted mostly to a diet of minerals, the primal ancestor relies on a diet of flesh and bones. Some point out that their digesting of creatures as a whole ultimately enabled their offspring's adaption to a diet of minerals. As such scientits point out the difference of bones and minerals seems minor. In Gomprona the Hulking Behemoth is a comparatively peaceful creature. Though perfectly able to hunt for the bone and marrow it needs, it's relatively docile when well-fed. Yet given their sheer mass and muscle in fact they are rarely if ever well-fed aside from the controlled environment of captured Hulking Behemoth's. All attempts to tame the creatures resulted in utter and sometimes fatal failure so the gnomes gave up on wasting valuable crystals on such endeavours. The area that currently houses operation challenger has been cut off from the main island by a relatively new lava stream. Said area seemingly was the breeding and hatching ground of the local behemoths population and it has yet to be seen how the hulking behemothes adapt to this - or if the lava foreshadowed their inevitable extinction. As for now the Hulking Behemoth population has suffered and competing creatures prospered, but slowly the number of behemoth's seem to be stabilising and reaching a new equilibrium.",

Yet as such creatures, if they even exist, are rarely sighted, there is little chance to proof or disproof such claims so they tend to be pervasive. Even for other ape creatures it's impossible to pinpoint any form of lineage as there are too many of what scientists call 'missing links' to trace down any ascendency. As tempting as it might be to connect the ape civilisations of Tiquanda and Banuta especially to the primal Gorerilla, there is no actual proof to justify this. Despite heated debates, with little evidence, in the end it became a moot point in the end which species of the known bigger ape species are descendants of this vicious species. The Gorerilla itself is a brutal predator that heavily relies on scare tactics to fend of other predators. Posing and yelling akin to that of ordinary gorillas and their relatives might stop only the most impressable predators in Gnomprona. But their threatening behaviour can be backed up by the raw power, steel-like muscles and a set of nightmarish teeth that puts even those of sharks to shame. Their jaws sport not only one row of teeth but two, allowing it to shred flesh like thin paper. The pointy teeth seem to be built to pierce armor, natural or artificial. Their powerful arms can grapple most opponents with ease and their iron grip is hard to escape from. Of course being in the grip of their arms makes one prone to bites of their murderous teeth. They mostly lack any climbing skill that other apes might display and actually seem rather clumsy, probably because of their sheer mass and muscles. The flesh of the Gorerilla is inedible and seems to mostly consist of tough meat due to their muscles, that is impossible to chew. The Gorerilla in turn, though capable of eating plant matter, relies on flesh and blood as sustenance mostly. They are very diligent when it comes to cleaning bones of even the slightest shred to flesh and leave the skeletons of their victims almost impossible clean. Only their offspring has a diet of fruits, roots and insects mostly. They hide in the thickets where they compete with numerous other cubs of local creatures for a limited supply of food.",

Expert trackers and big game hunters they shun other distance weapons then the spear. They are equally skilled in throwing their spears as in wielding them in battle and as they are trained in some minotaur form of paladin knowledge they are able to conjure them on their own in time of need. A hunter's training begins early in life and requires a certain dedication as the tests of skill and endurance are increasingly challenging from year to year. Each year a number of candidates is rejected and sent to other duties often to the army where their skills are welcome. So many minotaur soldiers possess some grade of schooling in outdoorsmanship. Those who pass all tests are welcomed into the local hunters' lodges. As other societies in minotaur civilization, the hunters are rather secretive about the rituals and secret knowledge of their lodges so little is known beyond the obvious. Only fully accepted hunters are taught the last secrets of the lodges, as certainly several spells to hone their skills. They are also schooled in the anatomy of different species to inflict maximum damage by exploiting weak spots. This is especially handy when fighting larger creatures that are usually only engaged by groups of hunters. Such groups are formed permanently and each hunter belongs to one. The number of members usually differs from five to fifteen with a group size of eight being the standard. A group with fewer than five members is disbanded and the remaining hunters are split between other groups. Still hunters are also sent on solo missions, especially when working for the army. They are the scouts, lookouts and responsible for the choice of camp-sites of a marching army. In Battle they are usually hold back as most minotaur generals yet lack to see their usefulness in open battles. Employed as a group in tandem with an army they are used to harass the enemy, spy on it's move and sabotage their resources. The minotaur hunters really shine though, when it comes to hunt great beasts of the deep such as dragons and behemoths. That is where their training kicks in most and provides groups of hunters with the knowledge and momentum to overcome seemingly overpowered foes. Though formerly seen rarely in combat with other the beasts, some smaller and newer minotaur communities rely less and less on a formalized army and according battle tactics. Their troops see a greater number of hunters employed on the battlefield with their combat style working more then well with the skirmish approach that such communities usually employ.",

They usually hunt in packs, mostly at night. They chase their prey until it is exhausted, then the pack sets upon its victim and disembowels it. These noisy animals have several types of cries and bloodcurdling howls. They make a maniacal laughing sound when attacking which turns rapidly into a miserable whimper if they suffered from too many counterattacks and see their lives endangered.",

Only recently have they resurfaced and sadly proven that the creatures the dwarfs encountered in the past were either a lesser variation or merely their juvenile forms. The true Stone Devourers are certainly more dangerous than those of the dwarven chronicles. They are underground dwellers displaying extreme aggressiveness and destructiveness. They often live in packs led by an alpha male. Oddly enough, the alpha seems to accept the submission of certain other races, which are then integrated into their packs. They are also alarmingly not territorial. Their packs wander the depths aimlessly, devouring and destroying everything in their way. The stone devourers are extremely resilient towards environmental conditions and seem not to mind to camp in areas that are extremely hazardous to other creatures. Therefore they often surprise wanderers who are familiar with the surroundings by attacking from unexpected places.",

However, just because the Reality Reaver possesses a form that follows predictable patterns to an extend which other beings do not, it is not yet in possession of sentience.This being said, the Reality Reaver is just as malignant as the rest of its ilk. However, it has certain characteristics that are more often found in ordinary creatures, whereas the other \"newly created\" are closer in nature to a tornado or a wildfire. For instance, it has been reported that it creates small flocks of its own kind in order to attack in a pack. Still, even a single Reality Reaver is a force to be reckoned with.The Reality Reaver seems somewhat more stable than the rest of its kind. While the others regularly dissolve and re-form, even in the realm beyond, the Reality Reaver is more anchored in our reality and with that, one step further towards our plane of existence. It cannot be foreseen what this means for our future.Whether or not the current crisis can be averted, one thing is certain; an invasion of these creatures can no longer be prevented. The very existence of the Reality Reaver and its ability to manifest in a concrete form is an indication that our reality's laws of probability helps these incursions to evolve into a more stable state of existence, which makes them more dangerous. The Reality Reaver is already very dangerous and destructive, but the aspect that it evolves in our world makes the Reality Reaver even more unnerving. Scholars have proven themselves inadequate to the task of classifying these new creatures. They have categorised them as \"forces of destruction\". Equally erroneously, they have labelled the Reality Reaver as a \"destruction golem\". This classification is so obviously wrong that it would never stand a close examination.",

To make matters worse, Dragon Hatchlings are hardly encountered without their parents being close. Lured by the cry of their brood, the enraged parents tend to enter the battlefield in the worst moment. Furious about the threat posed to their offspring, the elder dragons become even more formidable opponents.

        "text": "For unknown eons, a wound festered between our reality and the hungry annihilation from beyond. This wound gave birth to and granted refuge for many abominable creatures. When Ferumbras futile actions violated the boundaries between worlds, it was none of those abominations that slipped through first, but some natural, or rather unnatural, disaster. These beings, which do not possess any sentience, were driven by some sinister and destructive purpose. A prime example for such creatures is the Breach Brood. The Breach Brood can be best described as a force of destruction which has taken shape. It somehow interacts with its surroundings - usually in a brutal way. The Breach Brood seems even more unstable than others of its ilk; because of that it is unable to exists for a lengthy period of time outside the disruptive netherworld in which it spawned. It still strives towards its only purpose - the annihilation and consumption of reality. This is an enemy that can't be reasoned with, an enemy that knows no mercy and shows no mercy. Its whole existence is completely bound to nothing else than destruction. Its very existence already causes harm to our reality and its inhabitants. Its attacks can rather be compared to a fire burning a hand which accidentally happened to touch it than a planned move. Like a fire that burns straw but not stone, its actions are only expressions of itself and nothing more. Some assume that the Breach Brood and other beings from beyond are nothing more than the manifestation and with that part of the ultimate destruction all around them.To conclude, the Breach Brood is a rather forceful foe that does not follow any form of battle plan. It needs to be extinguished before it can spread further harm, however, it is necessary to approach it with the same caution one would use facing a natural phenomenon.",

With long lance-like weapons, they try to slow down their enemies while other dworcs attack from a safe distance. Like all dworcs, the constant exposure to poison has made them immune to all toxic effects, and like all dworcs they like to apply some sort of poison on their weaponry. Without their allies their fighting abilities to delay and to distract their enemy becomes almost worthless, and so they pose only a little threat to a seasoned fighter.",

Others forge dark pacts with necromancers and demons to rise again after death.It is said that the first Undead Dragons were created by the malicious bonelords who are known to meddle with undeath and necromancy. Created as a weapon in some ancient war, the first Undead Dragons proved to be so powerful that they could not be controlled by their masters. They broke free of the bonelords' subterranean bone fencings and wreaked havoc on their own. The escaped Undead Dragons served as role models for other dragons who longed for this seeming immortality. Even though only a few dragons walked the shadow path that ultimately led to the embrace of unlife, those who did began to transform into even more powerful and threatening beings which finally developed to Undead Dragons. More similar to the lich than the usual undead, they have kept more of their former personality and knowledge than undeads of other races are able to. Their new powers make easily up for the loss of some of their dragon skills.",

In the course of time, the transformation starts more and more early and lasts for a longer time. At a certain point, the beast takes over and there is no return. The human part is washed away by rage and primal instincts. The cursed person has turned into a savage Werewolf permanently.Werewolves are ferocious beasts who enjoy the thrill of a hunt. They are unnatural born hunters that have many traits of a wolf, but are much more dangerous and lethal. Like wolves, a Werewolf claims a large hunting ground as its own and everything alive is seen as a suitable prey. Unlike wolves, werewolves do not only hunt for food, but also for the thrill of the hunt itself. Their magical nature makes them extremely resistant and their regeneration powers are legendary.The curse of the Werewolf is usually spread by the infectious bite of other werewolves. Forbidden books tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a Werewolf with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.It is told that the girtablilu were first created by the sun god Suon in order to serve him and his sister Fafnar. They stood guard outside the gates of Suon's and Fafnar's temple high in the sky above Tibia, in a time when the divine siblings had not yet fallen out with each other. The scorpion men opened the doors for Suon and Fafnar as they traveled out each day, and closed the doors after them when they returned at night. They also protected the entrance the Land of Darkness. Ancient writings tell that their \"terror is awesome\" and their \"glance is death\". Nowadays they are guarding the sunken Ruins of Nuur against unwanted intruders.",

Their desiccated bodies are trapped in a state of perpetual decay, perpetually soaked in a putrid sludge that oozes from their withering flesh. The scent of decay hangs heavy in the air around them, a nauseating reminder of their eternal torment. These wretched beings shuffle aimlessly through the fallen realm, their existence a testament to the relentless grip of decay and the insidious nature of the realm they inhabit. Despite their deteriorating forms, the Sopping Carcasses possess a twisted vitality, fueled by the foul energies that course through their veins. They lash out with clumsy yet potent attacks, driven by an instinctual desire to spread the corruption that has consumed them.",

Fast and lethal, those fighting machines are a hurricane of teeth and claws when it comes to combat. Like all tigers they are solitary creatures, although small tiger families are not an uncommon view. Even though they are mostly hunting smaller mammals of the jungle, sometimes they are also after larger prey. They easily feel threatened and like most warlike creatures, they react on threats with violence.",

They view every product of the bulltaur's forges as a sacred gift, which they proudly display in the form of elaborate tattoos and the armor and weaponry worn. Despite their brutish nature, they are rather simple-minded and superstitious, often deferring to the wisdom of their elders and leaders, whom they blindly follow. This makes them easy targets for manipulations by priests and astrologers that use them as pawns in their power games. Their every action is governed by their unyielding belief in the divine origins of their forged equipment, making their use in war a sacred act, often accompanied by simple battle prayers. Some among their kind revere the occasional warrior saints, who scholars see as remnants of a long forgotten war-cult that was obliterated but not entirely erased when the Forge Cult claimed dominance.

With their peculiar perception of time, they value a second in the past as much as a day in the present, rendering the concept of death meaningless to them. They relish in their great strength and sheer power. As wardragons are infertile and seem genderless, it is still an enigma how Nimmersatt is able to muster them in such great numbers. Theories are abound about a supposed wardragon queen or Nimmersatts knowledge of stashed away wardragons from the past. Wardragons are viewed as tools by their master, tools devoid of the comprehension that they are seen as disposable pawns in the grand machinations of dragons. Sometimes squads of them are deployed to just create havoc but usually they accompany other, more intelligent dragons as bodyguards or warriors.",

It doesn't help they were taught to be the best of the best as each head tends to see those words as addressed to himself only. Rarely do the heads find accord, but when they do, the Mega Dragon ascends rapidly in power. Whenever one of their kind becomes overly influential, it is prone to draw the attention of Nimmersatt. In theory such dragons should be all what Nimmersatt envisioned then to be. However, this often triggers his vanity, leading to the unfortunate fate of the influential dragons being invited to his dinner table - as lunch.

These dragons bear a subtle, smouldering resentment toward their kin, their bitterness manifesting as sarcasm and cunning.

As longtime goals and personal ambitions seldom align, for most of the time a dracolisk is often a loner, following its own agenda. Dracolisks excel in manipulation through their dark intellect and deceptive wiles, relishing in the slow torture, subversion, and ultimate destruction of individuals and communities.

        "text": "The Husher is what comes closest to a magic-using shaman in the ranks of the Lost. Rather instinctively, and probably by having watched their ominous superiors working spells, they acquired some form of magic on their own. This led to a unique mixture of magic types which magic theorists would deem impossible, yet surprisingly enough yields results. Their magic is in no way subtle, and they probably regard it as some kind of divine wonder, rather than a product of their own actions. It is unknown whether Hushers are able to use more than the battle magic that has been observed. Given the nature of the Lost, it seems unlikely that they developed some other use of their mystical gifts, but as with so much else concerning the Lost, as they have only been encountered in battle and captives could not be reasoned with, little is known about their home and culture. Besides their magic, the Hushers are as wild and bloodthirsty as any other Lost, although some more planning and smartness can be attested to them. They are extremely resilient to pain, and part of their semi-religious acts seems to involve ritually cutting off their own skin, and scorching themselves with hot irons. Their simple religion seems centred on suffering and worship of everything that is associated with fire, heat and lava. For some reason, their magic bears an extreme affinity to smoke rather than fire itself. The intricacies of their belief system, if one exists at all, and how they teach each other their techniques, are still puzzling given the violent and animal behaviour of the Lost. It has to be assumed that somewhere in the depths of the earth where the Lost are bred, there is something like a Lost community with at least rudimentary structures, which allow them some kind of cultural identity and teaching of skills that go deeper than the mere animal-like drill which the fighting forces of the Lost seem to receive.",

Even if the Marsh Stalkers were bred on purpose, it is hard to tell now what the original intention behind this project might have been. The Marsh Stalker is very territorial, breeds in great numbers, and has become a bothersome nuisance in the areas where it can be found. Its worst habit is caused by its diet, which consists not only of plants and insects, but also of plant fluids and most notably tree sap, which it obtains by pecking open the bark with its strong beak. As a rule, the trees don't suffer such a treatment and are irreversibly damaged or killed. This poses a threat to all settlements which rely on wood, as Marsh Stalkers are known to ruin the woods of certain areas quite rapidly if unchecked. What is more, the Marsh Stalker is unable to tell a living plant from a wooden construction, and frequently ruins not only the wood supply, but also wooden objects in general. Even worse, the Marsh Stalker considers everything that lives a rival and tries to chase it away using its strong beak and sharp claws. As it is unable to realise that its intimidation tactics do not work, this may lead to a gruesome fight to the bitter end. Still, some people fancy the feathers of the Marsh Stalker as material for tailoring, and Marsh Stalker steak is considered a delicacy in certain areas. Ironically, almost exclusively in areas where the Marsh Stalker is not known as a safety hazard, and quite rare. Some underground arenas raise Marsh Stalkers for cage fights, but raising them is a complicated process that takes a lot of time and effort, and so such fights are very rare. Attempts to train the aggressive birds in some way have not met with any notable success yet. Constant hunts and campaigns have limited the appearance of the Marsh Stalker to rather remote areas, although the beast seems relatively adaptable.",

        "text": "The orclops is a newly discovered breed of orc which, after having been bred extensively by the orcs as war machines, very quickly lost its attraction to the point of extinction. The strength of a cyclops and the brutality of an orc did not mix well. The orclopses were prone to fits of rage and frequent rampages that cost the life of many a tribesman. Although stories of ancient battles mention whole battalions of orclopses, using them was deemed to be too dangerous to be worth the effort. In times of peace, feeding a single orclops was an onerous task for a tribe and feeding half a dozen of them drained a hunting ground empty. As a result, having an orclops became a status symbol for some warlords and all but died out as a subspecies.However, it can be regarded as ironic that a human secret society brought the orclopses back from the brink of extinction. Although the Brotherhood of Bones specialised in necromancy, some of them were eager to employ different kinds of weapons, minions and allies in their wars against the Nightmare Knights. Allying themselves with the Bloody Tooth orc tribe, they provided the orc shamans with the means to breed a better kind of orclopses. Even though this took time, this led to a new breed of orclopses that were more docile and intelligent, less driven by their basic instincts. Through their new found strength and superior intellect, they began to challenge their orc masters for the leadership of the tribe. Orc society reacted harshly by simply enslaving the orclopses with brute force. The new orclopses were subjugated and trained for war by their enslavers.This worked well for the orcs for a while. But then came \"Big Ugly\". Big Ugly was an unruly orclops and quite intelligent. To break his spirits, his enslavers made him endure the most torturous procedures of their training again and again. As a result, his body and face were so scarred by wounds that it inspired his name. Big Ugly survived and became the most feared fighter of the orclopses. Due to his strong will, his handlers never dared to use him in wars. Instead he was forced to compete in brutal pit-fights against captives and monsters from all over the world. Then they made the fateful decision to let him train other orclopses in the arts of fighting. Little did they know how intelligent and persuasive Big Ugly was. In a short time, he became the idol of the orclops slaves of the tribe. He led them in an uprising. He and his allies swept over the tribe in a single night and crushed all resistance.For half a century there was open warfare between orcs and orclopses. Whenever local orcs heard that the orclopses had arrived in their territory, they either slaughtered their orclopses or released them in the hope that this would appease the approaching orclops tribe. Soon only remote tribes still held captive orclopses.Luckily for the orcs, the new tribe quickly fell into factions upon the death of Big Ugly. Given their immense need for food, a single territory could not sustain a large tribe for long. The newly created clans roamed the world as nomads, slowly diminishing in numbers once again. Nowadays orclopses and orcs have developed a grudging respect for each other. Some of the smaller clans have even joined orc tribes, although this time as allies instead of as slaves. Others have settled in remote areas independently.The Orclops Ravager is the most common orclops. Strong and somewhat dumb, the typical Orclops Ravager spends most of his day satiating his enormous appetite. In battle he relies on his strength and rarely employs any complicated tactics.",

The Chakoya Windcallers are considered as a mixture of saints and abominations, certainly nothing any sane chakoya would eat.

In some rare cases, a Chakoya Windcaller survives on its own, rather relying on its instinctive magic than on its brawn. As an adult, a Chakoya Windcaller has either been recognised and raised as such or gradually begins to lose its magic abilities, mostly turning into a Chakoya Toolshaper instead.The magic of the Chakoya Windcallers is rather primitive. They use the elements for protection, enhancement or damaging effects. Like every chakoya, they rely on close combat so their ability to cast distance spells is limited.

Mostly oblivious to the hostile environment and haughty with the self-image of superiority, these demons fear nothing and no one and see themselves as the new rulers of the realm by right, born out of might. Little do they know yet, about the transforming horrors that await them and will erode even their arrogance. For now they delight the torture and mayhem that they can wreak in the plane, seemingly mostly unsupervised by their superiors. More often than not those superiors used the assignment to Zarganash as a method to get rid of troublemakers and malcontents of all kinds. Of course this leads to high levels of internal power struggles and its quite common that small cabals are formed to acquire some temporary power, only to be on each other's throats as soon they notice the slightest weakness of their so-called allies. While evil and treacherous in their core anyway, the madness that gets an ever growing hold on them makes them dangerous even to their own kind. While they retain their conscience they more and more become victims of sudden urges, ideas that are not entirely their own but the whispers of the realm itself. Once a demon has stayed for some time in Zarganash he is no longer welcome amongst their outside brethren and not allowed to leave. As the demonic hierarchy uses assignments to Zarganash as a means to dispose unwanted minions in a subtle and sinister way, sooner or later the consequences of an assignment to Zarganash become obvious. The more the infernal demons become aware of their abandonment, the more they indulge in orgy's of destruction and rage, often aimed at new arrivals in the realm. Whatever the original purpose of their mission might have been, it has long become meaningless to them and most of them are actively sabotaging the efforts of their former masters out of sheer spite - at least this is what they perceive as their motivation.Over time most infernal demons become permanently bound to Zarganash and transform into brachiodemons.",

Campaigns to eradicate this pest by both, the orcs and the lizards, failed to bring a lasting change to the Lancer Beetle population.Not really a swarm insect, Lancer Beetles usually live in small colonies. For unknown reason though, at certain times, they unite to build enormous swarms to devastate whole areas with their ravenous hunger. Guided by an unseen force, they crawl together even from the most remote spots. Without an apparent leader or queen, they seem to share a unique instinct and will to devour and destroy. Usually such swarms are met with resistance by the natives, and sharp battles for survival are fought against such swarms. Often enough, such fights can be compared with an attempt to stop a river with bare hands though. The sheer number of the beetles ready to replace one of their slain kin seems endless. However, after a while, as suddenly as it has formed, the swarm dissolves.",

In Gnomeprona it's just another hunter, competing for food and sometimes ending up as such for other, even more vicious predators. Yet the sabretooth adapted quite well to the harsh environment, having numerous litters of kits frequently and being very protective towards their offspring, the predatory cats don't take long to reach adulthood. The young sabretooth's are extremely agile, fast and stealthy. Still a lot of them fall prey to one of the other primal hunters. Despite all their abilities and the protection provided by their mother, only a small fraction of them reaches adulthood at all. A fully grown Sabretooth, however, often lives a long life and has astonishing regenerative abilities that let them survive wounds that would have left other creatures dying or maimed. As such wounds still leave their distinctive marks, some of the more recognizable cats could be re-recognized and thereby verified to reach relatively long life spans. As the first expeditions to Gnomprona are a relatively recent things further date on that matter had to be gathered though. They tend to have small lairs hidden deeply in thickets and often hunt in small packs. Their hunting habits resemble more that of wolf packs then those of the larger cats on the ground. Now and then they seem to form super packs, in which several packs band together. It's a rare occurrence and seldom witnessed by an observer who lives to tell the tale. In fact it's so rare that it even might be a myth, based on coincidence. Anecdotical tales mention that such packs viciously attack each and everything in its way, bringing down even the most fierce foes by sheer strength in numbers. There are hints that the sabretooth population almost spread to other subterranean areas in the past. Skeletons found in the caves in a wide area around Gnomprona prove, that now and then a sabretooth ventured deep into the surrounding tunnels. Yet as of now there are no verified reports of any other sabretooth populations in other caves explored by dwarfs or gnomes.There are still persistent rumours about white and blind cave tigers that might be related to more successful descendants of such endeavours by the gnomerean cats.",

        "text": "The cloaks of terror are the remnants of demons that entered the realm of Zarganash just to be devoured and ripped to pieces by its inhabitants. Their demonic residue slowly remained trapped in the realm and over time mixed and fused with other soul fragments, ultimately forming a new, vile construct that once again roamed Zarganash as mindless force of hunger and destruction. The cloaks are predatory and mostly instinct driven beings that prey exclusively on the living. When no living being is present they roam wide areas in their mostly futile hunt for prey. Eventually they slow down considerably and fall into dormancy after some time. While dormant they meld into the environment and are almost undetectable. Their overall composition makes them an undesirable prey for other denizens of Zarganash and so they can spent their time in dormancy relatively save. How long it takes to let them slip into such a state is widely different and probably dependent on several factors. Yet it seems common that they gather at some spots before going into dormancy. If a living being, in theory a rare occurrence in Zarganash, enters their presence, they wake up almost simultaneously which is a truly terrifying sight. A mass of silent levitating bodies that floats towards their target is enough to shake even the bravest warrior. Even worse though they emit a sound, that only dogs and certain other animals are seemingly able to hear, but that is nonetheless unsettling and even frightening to most humanoid beings. Their life detection has a fair amount of range and is seemingly shared with other cloaks in an area. Whenever one of them is able to sense life, all others will know and act on it. Their waking up is almost immediately and they waste no time before heading towards their prey. They show a great amount of violence and cruelty in their attacks, yet they seem in no way or form to devour any matter or energy of their targets. So it is even more astonishing what draws them to the living specifically and why they attack them with such ferocity. Why a creature in the land of the dead should so heavily specialise on the living is yet another insidious trick that the realm seems to play on intruders. No cloak of terror has yet been unleashed upon the realm of the living. It can be hoped that it's very nature is so heavily bound to Zarganash, that the cloaks are unable to pass the shroud between realms.",

Gnomes tend to exterminate all fungus worm populations entirely, not only for the damage they could cause on fungus farms but for the fear they might be a younger state of evolvement of the deepworm. Though every research end evidence has disproven this theory, the typical gnomish mushroom farmer will take no risk. The true reproduction of the worm is as disgusting as it's other habits. Deepworms are both male and female. In their mating that is more an entangling and wrestling with each other, both compete to penetrate the other with some kind of stinger on their belly. The winner injects their eggs into the losers body. After a few days that worm becomes slow, fat and tired. After a few days he bursts and the deepworms that were eating it from inside out scurry in all directions. The deepworm itself is a disgusting creature with even more disgusting eating habits. Though it's usual diet consists only carrion and plant matter, the worms are known to attack weak, ill or incapacitated being. Their silent attacks on sleepers has cemented their reputation as disgusting killers that have to be exterminated. In the armies of those bellow the deepworms show a far more aggressive behaviour. They attack every enemy and are surprisingly capable fighters. if left alone they roam the depths almost mindlessly at a slow pace. In employ of the deep armies though they are disturbingly quick and mindless aggression can become frightening at times. They know no fear and will throw themselves at each and everything in their way. Their lack of self-regard make then dangerous fighters that will deliberately take a blow just to land a bite on their victim. Wounds don't slow them down, they don't even show any reaction to it. Their thick, stinking blood that closes their wounds quite fast is mildly corrosive to other creatures. After a battles they roam the battlefield and look for corpses to eat. This and their habit to burrow into the corpses let some of them end up in the belly of a devourer who compete with them for the spoils of war.",

The beast of these tales is probably based on early encounters of gnomes with tunnel tyrant in a long forgotten past. This may hint that the tunnel tyrant might have been more common in areas closer to the surface but for what reason ever then vanished from the tracks of history for an untold time just to reappear in the recent invasions from below. Given the sheer numbers encountered, it's save to assume that the tunnel tyrant at least in our time isn't at the verge of extinction. Sadly enough they hold up to all the vicious and cruel things that the old tales attributed to them. It possesses a raw, bestial cunning and though not capable of speech like in the tales, they obviously posses some sort of intelligence. They often hold back in battle until they spot an opening or weakness and tend to let others do the dirty work and take the beating. They prefer fights where the odds are at their favour and like to ambush unsuspecting opponents. They rather wait for reinforcements than to attack on their own and often circle their opponent like a shark before ready to strike. In the armies of those below they somewhat lack the opportunity to act as cautious and cunning as they are used to but more often then not the causality rating of a battle is on their favour. In freedom the tunnel tyrant is a highly territorial creature that hunts in small packs that have their lairs in spacious caves. With their emergence in the armies of those bellow the tunnel tyrant can no longer be considered to be a rare creature of the depths but if there are a greater number of lager populations deeper down or if they are specifically bread for the armies, no one can tell. Their usual prey are bugs and cave spiders that stand no chance against them. Bolder packs occasionally raid the lairs of giant spiders and their brood, which seems to be a special treat for them. By all devious cunning they are not cowardly though. If they decided on a prey they will fight viciously with all their might to bring down even bigger and stronger opponents.",

Rumours say that unless killed, a scarab will not die of old age but continue to grow and grow to enormous proportions. Their usual pace of movement is not impressively fast, but they are capable of doing sudden charges to catch their opponents off guard. Even more dangerous, their poison is strong enough to allow these creatures to emit large clouds of stinking death and mayhem around themselves. Ancient Scarabs are said to be the keepers of mysterious secrets swallowed by the sands long time ago. So don't be surprised if some of them might display even more cunning tactics and devastating magic.",

This state of mind is considered unclean by the minotaurs and their society had come up with several ways to cope with this problem. Yet no minotaur would foolishly deny that this inner rage is a constant companion in a minotaurs life. Sometimes this rage manifests in especially cruel ways. Some tragic minotaurs are born 'into the rage' as the minotaurs say. They never have a chance to battle their inner rage but are born into the world with fierce anger and bloodlust. Those young calves are taken into custody by special trainers, most of the high ranking mooh'tah masters. They train the youngsters to at least control somewhat of their rage and funnel it into certain tiresome and draining tasks. This upbringing with mining, hauling and woodcutting from the earliest age combined with the constant burning energy in them, lets them grow out of the proportions of normal minotaurs. Often easily twice as high as a minotaur this veritable giants are more beast then civilized minotaur. Regardless of the strictness of their upbringing they never grasp concepts of society. They never develop the ability of speech and only communicate through moohing sound to express simple emotions. Yet they understand simple commands and therefore are used as powerful work-machines and dangerous weapons in combat. Despite their strength and arguably usefulness they are shunned and despised by minotaur society. They are the lowest of the low and mistrusted. Oddly enough their handlers and trainers are usually regarded with admiration, because they take it upon them to handle the unclean so that the rest of the society can ignore their existence. Hardly more intelligent then a dog and only able to use the most simple tools and weapons the moohtants, as they are called by humans, are rarely deployed in battle unless times are very desperate. While the rulers of civilized places like Mintwalin tend to tow them away out of sight and use them in remote mines, younger communities can't afford such luxury and use their power with often dangerous frequency.",

Amongst a flock of other hungry baby serpents, only the strongest survive the ferocious appetite of their siblings. While fighting for food with each other, they have to elude the occasional attacks of their uncaring parents. Quickly, the fight for survival becomes natural to the Young Sea Serpent. It's not such a surprise that Young Sea Serpents are aggressive and predatory. To reach the immense size of an adult sea serpent, a Young Sea Serpent has to eat almost constantly. Always driven by hunger, they are often more daring and aggressive than adult serpents. Gladly they are too small to pose a threat to ships but they may attack small fisher boats.They often follow fish schools to devour as much of them as they can. When doing so, it is not uncommon that they cross the path of a fisherman. Lucky are those who come out of such meetings with nothing worse than ruined nets. Often the ferocious attacks of the Young Sea Serpents capsize whole boats and the fishermen lose their catch and sometimes also their lives.Given their appetite and the aggressiveness of their species towards each other, it is not astonishing that Young Sea Serpents often are loners. In the rare cases they stick together, they have hatched from the same nest and have established a strict hacking order that is necessary to avoid bloodshed and cannibalism.",

They are high-ranking members of the hierarchy and with that they are often deeply involved in palace politics and intrigues. It is said their valued intellect binds them to such positions and all these intrigues and deceit are only ways to blow off steam. So when the rare occasion arises that a Draken Spellweaver takes part in a battle, they are often more fierce than their warrior cousins. They combine spells and physical attacks and so pose a threat to even the most experienced fighters. Although highly capable in the realms of magic, they only use a limited array of spells. Most of them are quite direct and have an immense damage output. The majority of Draken Spellweavers see battles as an welcome escape from their duties such as studying and regulating. They enjoy to leave all finesse and intrigues behind and to taste the blood of an enemy.",

But some sinister beings are aware of the fate that looms above them. They research forbidden knowledge and forge dark pacts in time. This allows them to rise as a sentient and powerful form of ghost, known to those with mystical knowledge as Spectre. Spectres usually posses some being that functions as shell that they have prepared during lifetime. Often they use beings to which they have a strong emotional bond like family members. In the long run, the Spectres' puppets die away and leave the Spectre stranded in the world of mortals without a suitable host.

However, their undeniable power as well as their race's natural tendency towards pride make them vulnerable to the temptations of vanity and arrogance. The Marid, being devout followers of the prophet Daraman's teachings, try to resist these temptations as well as they can, but it has happened before that a Marid strayed from the true path and succumbed to the corruption and the lowly desires that are hidden deep in the soul of every djinn. Beware of such fallen Marid, because they are no better than the Efreet, the Marids' green-skinned djinn cousins and arch-enemies.",

Usually only encountered in the hottest places of the world, they were rarely seen in the past. Recently, though, there have been more and more sightings in the depths of Tibia. When they are encountered, they are usually in liaison with 'those below'. It can only be speculated what this means for the Cliff Strider race as a whole. While they were formerly seen as some strange life-form that was only dangerous when it was disturbed in its unbearably hot and hostile living spaces, it is now speculated that the Cliff Striders are some form of cattle for 'those below' that are also commonly used in their wars as some kind of weapon. Still, there are relatively peaceful and territorial enclaves of Cliff Striders that seem to pose no threat to outward communities. In the light of the connection to 'those below' there are furious debates how to handle such known enclaves. While there are voices to eradicate them all before the enemy can employ them, the majority is still voting to monitor the situation and get more solid information before any preemptive action is taken.",

It's not unheard of that a tremendous tyrant in frenzy completely forgets about his underlings and leaves them to their own devices.If a tremendous tyrant loses it's light organ, his capabilities to communicate are severely hampered. The organ usually grows back in a few weeks, yet some superiors have little patience with such underlings and executions of tyrants wounded that way are quite common.The tyrants are carnivorous and their behaviour suggests that they prey on the meat of strong opponents, often chasing away lesser minions to get their preferred meal.These violent taskmasters communicate with each other through their light signals in a fast way and are able to coordinate the attacks of their packs in frightening manners. The meanest and most vicious of them are known as alpha packmasters. Those have usually proven their supremacy over other tremendous tyrants in personal combat and often serve as the direct underlings of the leaders in the subterranean hordes. Such alphas are rare, however, and rarely seen in established territory as they are too useful in advance troops and larger moving armies.",

Whereas the emerald tortoise relies on a diet of minerals, like stones and crystals, it developed an aggressive form of defence to ensure its survival. Aside from the fact that the eggshells of the emerald tortoise are one of the hardest crystalline substances that even the Gnomes encountered yet, this tortoise processes the devoured minerals in a way that stows electricity in its body. Like some eels encountered in tropical waters they can discharge this energy seemingly at will, to scare away or even kill any predator. The emerald tortoise seems to have so much excess energy, that it tends to use this energy rather indiscriminately at even the slightest threat, which is often just the proximity of another creature or the sight of an unknown creature. As common in Gnomprona, the creature seems not satisfied with driving attackers away with such shocks but rather tries to actively kill its target, once acquired. The massive emerald tortoise is still able to swim, though the relatively calm water around gnomprona might favour this in some way. In water their discharges are far wider reaching and more lethal. Therefore it would be ill advised to try ones luck in taking a dip into the gnompronean sea. Though that could make them the unchallenged rulers of subterranean seas, they rarely leave the land. At best they slowly drift towards some stone formation in the sea to harvest them for minerals and crystals. The more docile giant sea turtles seem to be distant relatives of the emerald tortoises and are the only creatures known that don't trigger their defensive impulses. In fact there ae instances in which emerald tortoises were observed to seek refuge on top of their distant cousins and float around on them for a while. In turn it has been seen that they came to aid the giant sea turtles in the rare occasions some desperate cave shark tries to attack them. While there is little evidence yet, such rare occurrences seem to hint at the sea turtles being immune to the emerald tortoises energy shocks which would strongly hint at some form of relation of the creatures.",

Due to their immense power, they have little to fear and happily unleash their rage in battle. As revered members of the lizard society, they receive the best equipment the master craftsmen can supply, and they use it with skill and precision obtained in years of sedulous training. This combination of skill, natural prowess and superior equipment makes them the most valued and feared troops in the dragon empire. The raising and training of the Draken takes much time and dedication. There are rumours that Draken neither die nor get weaker when getting older, rather the opposite, they are supposed to become more and more powerful with every day. The most ancient of the Draken are said to form the 'Flame Guard', the personal elite bodyguard of the dragon emperor, as well as the fabled 'Enders', the private executioners and assassins of the dragon kings.",

For this reason, bat blood is high-priced among alchemists and probably also explains the bats connection to vampires in some way. Due to certain influences by contaminated food or magical radiation, some bats transformed into horrible beasts. These beasts are well-known as Mutated Bats. Unlike intended mutations that origin from experiments, the mutation of bats seem to happen rather spontaneous.Mutated Bats seem to lack the fertility of other mutated species as it is was never heard that they brought up offspring. The transformation into a giant-sized mutated bat seems to put some strain on the bats, turning them incredibly aggressive. Only the company of other Mutated Bats seems to calm them a little. Lonely Mutated Bats can become so aggressive that they attack their own shadow until they die of exhaustion.In certain areas with a high magical contamination, the Mutated Bat has become a dangerous plague. Swarms of those bats have killed whole small villages in a single night. Moving only in the darkness, they devastate the land like a swarm of locusts until they are stopped by military or brave heroes.As it is rather easy to create Mutated Bats on purpose, scholars of magic or alchemy often use them as watchdogs or tools of vengeance. Their aggressive and destructive nature makes such endeavours dangerous at best, and not few lost control of their vicious pet in a rather inconvenient moment.",

        "text": "Courage leeches are not actual entities but an actual manifestation of a void that the loss of courage by the souls in Zarganash leaves behind. All the more does the animalistic intelligence that they display mock such origins. Yet as it was the realm of Zagarnash that gave birth to them, this fact might only be an expression of some cosmic law that makes everything in Zarganash a twisted mockery of sane expectations. The courage leech are not actually leeching courage but they poison their victim's soul with a numbing enchantment that makes their targets prone to their fearsome attacks. They carry desperation and fear like a disease they spread, albeit involuntarily. While their own intention is probably more mundane, the stealing of essence and the spread of inner corruption is what makes the leeches extremely dangerous, especially for the living. Even more disturbing is the fact, that even when someone survives their attacks or overcomes them, the attacks of the leeches leave a spiritual scaring on the soul that never truly recovers. The interpretation of such scaring differs wildly. The most common interpretation is, that the soul is actually damaged if not diseased and that even to most pious, devout and pristine souls can be affected. This scaring is unaffected by any magical means known to men and seems not to heal on its own, even over an extended period of time. The death cultists of Ankrahmun see it as a permanent damage to one's soul, yet they claim to be able to repair the souls of true believers in elaborate rituals. In some rare cases souls harmed that way recovered seemingly on their own, but such occurrences are so rare that only anecdotal evidence exists and no reproducible steps could be determined. Some enchantments might provide a temporary shield that prevents the wounding in the first place but the few techniques to acquire such shields are closely guarded and seem to come with heavy penalties for the user. The leeches seem to have an affinity for the entity known as the unwelcome and are drawn to areas where it thrives. Given their nature it seems unlikely if they are allied, so it's up to speculation if they somehow leech on the action of the welcome or if is somehow using them for unknown purposes.",

The power of that demon is so immense that some of his ooze gained a sort of sentience over the years. Instinctively devouring more and more of the demonic ooze, it grows in proportions and sentience unless a semi-intelligent creature is formed that is known as Son of Verminor.The most powerful of them are recognised by their progenitor as his kin and serve as his minions. Usually not more than an almost mindless mass of decay and hunger, they can be used by their dark master almost like puppets to fulfil his unholy duties. It is assumed that they not only function as the long arm of their master, but also as his eyes, enabling him to sight what is happening in the vicinity of his 'son'. When encountered in the realm of man, Sons of Verminor are usually just a shambling ever-hungry mass that tries to consume everything that it can catch. Because of the mindless destruction they tend to cause, they are seldom summoned by the servants of the demons. The Sons of Verminor are usually used to make places as inhospitable as possible. Sometimes a greater number of them is summoned to make an area almost impassable for a while.",

At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.Werehyaenas are sly and tough, yet not too strong or coordinated. They are predators as well as carrion eaters and their appearance is a mix between a hyaena and a human being. Like hyaenas, Werehyaenas favour warm savannas and deserts as homesteads and are aggressive and cunning.The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

It's a creature that seems to be in a constant, highly agitated frenzy, hell-bent on hurting, destroying and devouring. Though arguably more an elemental then a creature the lurker is mostly encountered close to volcanic activity, some even claim to be born or created by it. Despite it's aggressive nature it can become dormant for an unknown time and even blend it with other lave or magma environment being perfectly camouflaged. It's unknown it's actively lurks for prey in this state or becomes somehow awake as soon as a potential victim comes close but the outcome is the same. The lava lurker coms into action and viciously attacks every potential victim like the raging fire that might have given birth to it. With no obvious organs it is unknown how lukers feed. Due to their eagerness to burn and sear thing, it's assumed that ashes of organic matter gives then some sort of sustenance. Though it's theorized that the lurker reproduces like the common slime, this is only wild speculation and not backed up by any evidence at all. The whole comparisons to slimes might be highly misleading and create more questions than it provides answers. How exactly they fit into the rooster of those bellow is also highly speculative. Some evidence suggest that their appearance might only be a side effect of the heat that comes with the advance of the hordes from bellow. Yet they mostly show no aggression towards the forces of those bellow, they are rarely part of attacks on outposts and when they do, it's almost more as if they are some force of nature then part of an army. This puts their whole sentience into question. Scientists and sorcerers that are fascinated by this creature but are just on the brink of their studies of the lava lurker. Only time will tell what valuable lessons can be made by their analysis. Given the destructive nature of the lava lurker though, a steep price might have to be paid in that process.",

Sometimes the spirits create the golems on their own, to act as a vehicle or tool to interact with the physical world. More often, though, Leaf Golems are spirits that have been bound into such constructs by some druidic power. Mighty druids often employ the help of leaf golems spontaneously. They are created on the fly and are often discarded when a task has been performed. Such discarded golems frequently disassemble on their own and the spirit is set free, but sometimes they decide to roam the world on their own. Leaf Golems are intelligent, but their thinking is based on the spiritual world and completely alien to the denizens of the physical world. Therefore it is impossible to communicate with them in any form. As spirits they seem to care little for the integrity of a physical body, and they often seek to destroy living beings, presumably to set their seemingly entrapped spirit free. Even though they may mean no real harm, their attacks are threatening and lethal nonetheless.The leaf golem is a random and undecided fighter, oblivious to what might be most effective in a given situation. On the other hand, it knows little fear and does not truly understand how to stay out of harm's way.Sometimes, druids who feel their life force waning and their end drawing near choose to transfer their spirits into a prepared Leaf Golem. These golems are considerably more powerful, but it is said that the inhabiting druid will eventually lose his grasp on the physical world and become a nature spirit on his own.",

Far to the north where it is cold enough to freeze even air, this race has its original home. In ancient times, when the gods waged war on each other, the world climate was shifting often. At this time, some tribes of the Frost Giants wandered to the south, following the biting cold and expanding their territory. Entire kingdoms crumbled under their feet.The Frost Giants became the ruler of the frozen waste and their icy kingdom grew every day. One day though, the seemingly eternal winter ended. Temperatures were rising again and most Frost Giants fled to the northern home of their ancestors. However, some of them became trapped on their retreat, cut off by the ocean that once used to be a frozen surface which could easily be crossed. Many of those unlucky Frost Giants perished either by the warm temperatures or by enemies who easily overwhelmed them in their weak condition. Some, however, were able to find refuge at places just cold enough to sustain their existence.Still those places are not well suited as they are much too warm for Frost Giants. Cut off from the northern Frost Giant civilisation and living in an inhospitable environment, the Frost Giants are known for their bad temper. Their sole joy seems to be to make other beings feel even more miserable than they do feel themselves. So they enjoy hunting, torturing or just smashing other creatures. Given this attitude, it's not surprising that the Frost Giants, though considerably intelligent, won't waste much time in parleying. If there is a chance to fight, they are using it. Frost Giants are extremely possessive and they fiercely defend their grounds against all intruders.",

The spouter seems not to rely on any form of sustenance but it seems somewhat to 'recharge' in proximity to naturally occurring sulphur. Therefore the spouter are usually found close to natural occurrences of sulphur like volcanic cracks. There are some vague hints that the sulphur spouters are not native to Gnomprona but migrated there from somewhere else. They seem to be relatively 'new' to the area, though new in the case of such primordial place still means an enormous amount of time to mortal creatures. As their corpses leave distinctive marks on earth, e4xcacvations revealed that such marks are missing in the deepest layers where still bones and other remains were found. The fact that the spouters seem keen to attack explorers and destroy artificial structures not native to the subterranean realm at times lead some to believe that they are somehow remotely controlled or following certain orders imprinted on them. While some think they might have been some kind of pets or servants of an extinct intelligent race that once dwelt in Gomprona, more paranoid Gnomes suggest that they might actually be agents of those below. Serving them as eyes and ears somehow and to link the activity of those below in the area to the recognition of gnomish presence by those creatures. Both theories have little evidence to prove their point of view though. As of now these peculiar creatures remain largely an enigma to science. The fact that captured sulphur spouters die within a few days for no discernible reason, makes any research in that matter complicated at best.",

        "text": "The burning books are created from pages formed from damned souls, bound with the essence of what the unenlightened calls hell and inscribes with runes of hellfire in a sinful language. Filled of what the gods opposing Zathroth and his allies would consider blasphemy and mockery of the godly order of things, these books have been given such a strong purpose that they unintentionally came to life. Burning not only with hell fire but also the desire to taint and burn everything that opposes Zathroth they are a common sight at places dedicated to him. The semi sentient books can't be controlled and so they are usually allowed to hover around, sniffing for all things that don't bear the mark of Zathroth. Sometimes, when a follower of Zathroth falls out of grace, they are the first to swarm him, attack him and ultimately incinerate him. Because of that faith trials are often held where many of the burning books made their lair. Though they technically intended with another, unknown sinister purpose, the sentience of the books had never stopped their production in the depth of hell. It is assumed that their production continues because they found their place and use despite being a failure. Other rumors though claim that only one burning masterbook was created at all and somewhere in the deepest, burning pits of hell this queen book still exists. Tended by an army of lower books, it spawns its burning breed with each beat of her burning heart.The burning books themselves are highly attuned to fire and wield it as shield and weapon. It is remorseless in its cruelty and eager to destroy anything that might displease Zathroth. How these animalistic creatures determine the dedication of others and how accurate they might be remains a secret. The cynical followers of Zathroth don't mind either and gleefully watch even the downfall of one of their own, when the books decide someone earned Zathroth' wrath.",

        "text": "The Omnivora is a strange offshoot of the Carniphila plant. This strain had an especially short life cycle, which allowed it to react rapidly to changes due to the fast production of new generations. It is assumed that some of those Carniphilas adapted to a more mountainous terrain, and settled in deep and dark valleys. Finding less soil and relying more on their carnivorous nature, they slowly compensated the lack of minerals through an enhanced digestion system which allowed them to consume bones and stones that the ordinary Carniphila would leave over. Less dependent on sunlight, the ancestors of the Omnivora found their way into the eternal darkness of subterranean areas. This they found to be a new habitat they were ideally suited for. The Omnivora quickly spread via tunnels and underground streams which carried their seeds. Only the fierce predators of the underground, who found the Omnivora a delicacy, stopped the population from exploding. Over time, the Omnivora adapted itself again and became highly toxic and inedible, but also less fertile. This led to a more stable population, but also to the Omnivora becoming the predator instead of the prey. The plants had developed highly acidic fluids to support their digestion of minerals, and newer generations employed these acids as weapons. Additionally, the plant used a surplus of certain minerals to build thorns around its blossom which acted as teeth. This led to a new cannibalistic behaviour, though. While Carniphila seedlings usually grow in immobile patches, the Omnivora, though featuring a similar reproduction pattern, as a seedling soon begins to attack other nearby seedlings; and this is repeated as soon as its growth allows it to reach the next seedling. Such infights usually continue until only one Omnivora seedling is left. Being a plant, it does not too well in too cold or too dry habitats, but apart from that the Omnivora's adaptable nature makes it possible to encounter it almost everywhere. Rather than looking for some additional sunlight like its Carniphila cousin, the Omnivora shuns direct sunlight, and usually settles in underground areas. Since they are particularly fond of the minerals provided by creatures turned into stone, Omnivoras seek out the proximity of creatures like Medusae if possible. The Medusae in turn seem to accept the Omnivora as some kind of decoration or pets in their lairs, unless they feel that the Omnivora is a pest destroying their 'artwork'. Some people warn that the development of the Omnivora species is not over yet, and that we might see an even more dangerous and aggressive breed in a few generations.",

Though they can take different shapes they favour a seductive appearance, for example in the form of young dancers. These demonesses are driven mainly by greed and envy. They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. There are several kinds of asuri. The midnight asuri have pale skin and moon-white hair, favouring clothes in the colours black and violet.

The harsh and rigorous training hones their skills and makes them a living weapon at the disposal of the emperor.

Using combat skills and spells, the Draken Elite has just the right answer to any combat situation in its claws.The Draken Elite have become some sort of knightly or religious order in the lizard society. Their grandmaster receives his order only from the dragon emperor himself, and their chapter house is part of the dragon emperor's palace. If the need arises, the emperor lends some of the elite warriors to one of the dragon kings. Sometimes out of need, another time as a boon or token of respect. The elite forces handle even the most trivial duty they are assigned to with precision and unwavering diligence. Often it is sufficient to send a single elite warrior to fulfil a task. When the need arises, small squads are sent which are capable to handle most threats on their own. Given the rarity of the elite forces, such squads are only seen under dire circumstances. Actually it seems that the elite forces are that accustomed to work alone that they do not even get along well with other members of the elite, let alone with 'lesser' warriors at the empire's disposal.",

The crystal spheres pulsed periodically in all colours of the spectrum and scared the Pigeons away. But the inhabitants of Thais grew deeply annoyed by the flashing lights, and even the claim that the crystals added a unique sight to Thais could not prevent the people demanding their being removed. In the end, the crystal spheres were dismantled and returned to the guild house. Still people complained to the king to do something against the pressing pigeon problem. Yet no bounty nor poison campaigns yielded the result they hoped for. Meanwhile, the people have begun to accuse each other of feeding pigeons, and the term 'pigeon friend' has become a common insult. King Tibianus had several people flogged who had claimed the king might be in league with the pigeons, and things are increasingly getting out of hand.

In the contrary to flimsy lost souls, freakish souls like animals can actually learn things and react purposely, albeit with rather limited intelligence. In rare occasions a spiritualist was able to reach the trapped consciousness in a freakish lost soul and had a form of limited conversation, which rendered the instinctive side of the soul inactive for the remainder of the contact. As soon as the contact is broken, however, the animal takes over again and reacts extremely angry and hostile, using all of its capabilities to attack immediately. It seems that other, more conscious inhabitants of the nether worlds are able to train and exploit them for their own sinister purposes. As such they are often used as attack and watch dog-like creatures by their masters and can even be encountered in areas they would instinctively avoid on their own.

        "text": "The corruption in Zao comes in many different ways. Often, the corruption which is visible is the least dangerous. Sometimes, however, the corruption rather touches the soul than the body. Sometimes, this goes unnoticed by those affected and those close to them. Sometimes, this leads to erratic behaviour, morbid fascinations, or a violent temper. Sometimes, the corruption goes unnoticed for a whole lifetime. Only in death those who are touched by the corruption learn the horrid truth about their nature. The taint in their soul twists their nature and refuses them the afterlife that awaited them. They are bound to the realm of the mortals in an ethereal form, tormented by an eternal hunger and plagued by their twisted vision of the world around them. They perceive the world as rotten and flawed, worth to be destroyed. Everything that exists is a pain to them, particularly if it is alive. Destruction and total oblivion seem to be the only salvation for them. Since their new ethereal body is inherently flawed, they constantly burn up spiritual energy in a rate that leaves them in a constant state of hunger. To satisfy this hunger, they feed on the vital force and soul energy of mortals. They absorb them by touch, although the most powerful of them drain the needed energy by their mere presence. Often, nothing more than mummified husks are left over from their victims.When the worst hunger is satisfied, they are cunning and relatively patient. They love to toy with their victims, but what they love the most is introducing them to their own twisted view of the world by demoralising the mortals, or shattering their dreams in some way. Quite soon though, their hunger takes over and they lose all interest in games and greedily feast on their prey.",

        "text": "Though relying on a diet of plant matter, the hostile environment of Gnomprona made this creature aggressive beyond reason. Aggression seems to be the driving force of their behaviour pattern as they even tend to ram trees until they break and fall, to later feast on otherwise unreachable leafs. Though they mostly graze on more reachable plants, its the mentioned behaviour that sticks to the memory of an observer mostly and serves as an ample warning to approach this creature with care as it eventually will inevitably attack. It doesn't matter, what the Gore Horn is distracted with in the moment, they attack anything on sight, assuming it's just another predator of the subterranean lands. Despite their individual prowess, the Gore horns tend to form small groups or even herds, to rely on strength in numbers. Such groups of Gore Horns stick together closely and rather die together than to leave one of their own back. They are even known to relentlessly attack a predator that already killed one of their herd, protecting it's corpse for quite some time. And they are even more protective towards their young ones though those often hide in thickets nearby. Sometimes such a herd of gore horns gets into a stampede in which they stomp down everything in their path. While the increase of volcanic activity was still a new thing in Gnomprona such stampedes were often observed, sometimes ending by the herd mindlessly plunging itself in the surrounding ocean and drown. Since then the creatures have to have grown accustomed to it and a stampede is a rather rare occurrence again. Oddly enough for such massive and relatively clumsy lizards they often build lairs deep in caves or even the underground. Certain findings suggest that they use volcanic heat to help them hatch their eggs and that might be the major reason, they dwell in caves, close to the volcanic heart of the area, though the attraction of cold blooded creatures to heat might be another reason.",

For a short while, they also comprised the largest group of the new enemies. However, this didn't last long and today only the most knowledgeable explorers still know about this fact. In many regards the Dread Intruders are considered as pure embodiments of the new threat. They were the first creatures who have been captured by aspiring scientists. By examining this enemy, they learnt about the Dread Intruder's fleeting nature as well as the fact that this creature cannot exist very long without the support of a nearby destruction vortex. Dangerous and highly volatile, the Dread Intruder was even assumed to slightly bend reality itself. In-depth studies, however, revealed that this is rather an optical effect caused by the sheer load of destructive energy accumulated in these creatures. Still, it can't be denied that the laws of nature seem to be weakened by its very presence. Even if a certain degree of probability is applied, one cannot deny the countless reports about flickering lights, distorted sound, or objects that suddenly show minor damages or even changed properties whenever a Dread Intruder was around. For this reason, particularly priests claim that the existence of the Dread Intruder defiles reality the most.Despite these numerous assumptions and speculations, the Dread Intruder is a dangerous force to be reckoned with. Although its lack of conscience seems to be a weakness, the sheer power of the Dread Intruder makes up for that, and one is well-advised not to encounter this powerful opponent unprepared or in disadvantageous situations. Even without any sign of intelligence, the Dread Intruder shows a horrifying effectiveness in exploiting a foe's weakness. This ability can only be explained by the theory that claims that the Dread Intruder is an embodiment of greater destructive forces.",

In this harsh environment only the most aggressive and capable individuals can survive, so that the relatively harmless Salamander has evolved into a creature that can scare off at least some attackers.

The diet of the Salamanders are smaller insects that are often found in abundance in their habitat. Only this allows for the continued survival of the Salamander species while surrounded by more powerful predators. The Salamanders are considered very distant relatives of the dragons, an assumption that is based solely on the fact that they are lizards and have a penchant to collect hoards. The so-called 'hoards' of the Salamanders usually consist only of a few shiny things they have gathered in the swamp, typically junk discarded or lost by adventurers in the area. Still, sometimes they are hunted by foolhardy soldiers of fortune who dream about an easy way to acquire some exotic treasure. Due to their tasting odd, Salamanders are hunted by trolls and orcs for food when times are dire. Sometimes local witches breed Salamanders as familiars, or as ingredients for their cooking or even alchemical usage.",

They have endured the trials of getting used to a physical body and gained a certain familiarity with it and the physical world.

They usually are so accustomed to an certain environment that they become extremely territorial. Still, most of them understand only very basic concepts of our world and are inhabited by a consciousness that is extremely alien to that of a human. Most of these old golems share an inexplicable aggression towards lifeforms that are not plants. On the other hand, they seem to be able to communicate with plants in some way and are usually overly protective towards them. These factors combine to an extremely dangerous state of mind that often led to attacks on anything that enters their woods. Astonishingly enough, their attacks display not only an affinity to the element earth, but also to the element of air, as they instinctively use it to enhance their movement or more often to hinder that of their chosen foes.There are rare cases of reports that tell about good-natured withered leaf golems. Almost all those cases can be linked to leaf golems inhabited by the spirits of former druids who have become more accustomed to their changed nature. These versions of the withered leaf golems often are considerably more powerful than their spirit brethren. Malignant versions of this amalgamations also exist. They often are loners that claim entire forests as their own and act as their self-proclaimed guardian, discouraging anyone to even enter the realm of their gruesome reign.",

Therefore the reappearance of the White Deer has been considered a good omen by the elvish society. In recent years under the protection of the elves, the population of the White Deer has recovered to a healthy base. Still the population is somewhat fragile and several local carnivorous animals, most prominently the wolves, have become dependent of the White Deer as prey. So despite elvish efforts, the deer are still endangered. Should too many of them meet an early demise, the population would have a hard time to recover, given all the predators of the woods.The White Deer itself is a magnificent yet peaceful creature of grace and beauty. Its fur and antlers are valued by traders though it is somewhat difficult to find a trader that does not fear the elvish ire. In modern days, the deer has been mostly demystified. The assumption of great wisdom has been discarded and the myths about its magical abilities have been disproved. Neither can the deer change the weather nor can they turn invisible when in danger. The human view of 'just another type deer' has led to confrontations with elvish rangers who vigorously defend the deer from hunters. So despite the profitable loot, the hunting of White Deer has become the domain of a few unscrupulous or daring individuals that do not mind to clash with self-proclaimed elvish protectors.",

The territorial animals do not appreciate visitors. Naga mythology tells, why these turtles have two heads: In the conflict between asuri and nagas, they would not choose one side.

On the other hand, it is certain that the Damselfly reproduces and has offspring of its own size. This leaves open the question whether its current state is the result of a deliberate manipulation, or whether some Damselflies accidentally came into contact with some kind of magic source, causing their giant growth. The latter theory sparked a search for this assumed source and an interest in Damselflies and their habits. So far, nothing conclusive has been announced by researchers. Meanwhile, the Damselfly has spread from the place of its first appearance in the Venorean swamps, and is frequently found in areas where its smaller cousin lives. Their diet consists of plant matter and smaller insects. Oddly enough, Damselflies are mildly aggressive when encountering larger species such as humans, which is atypical of their small variant. It is unknown what might cause this. However, the Damselfly poses a threat only to the wounded or completely unprepared wanderer. The creature can usually be found in areas with an abundance of insects they hunt and feed on. The Damselfly builds small cocoon-like structures made out of plant matter and saliva, in which they lay their eggs, on the shores of bodies of standing water. The Damselfly young hatch as worm-like creatures that spend the first stage of their lives in the water, preying on fish, frogs, insects and other, smaller Damselfly larvae. After some time, the worm crawls out of the water onto a nearby tree where his husk solidifies, and after a few days, a mature Damselfly breaks free from the crumbling remains.",

While probably the original aim is to reach some state of transcendence, the failed outcome is a creature trapped between the spirit world and the mortal realm. The failed transformation often dangerously maddens the dragon creature. Even those who against all odds manage to retain their sanity have to cope with the knowledge that they turned in some, even in their own eyes, abominable creature instead in the intended ascended being. This leads to the fact that also the few sane specimens are usually not less aggressive and destructive than their mad fellows.Although the legends of the lizard folk also tell about some extremely wise and benevolent Ghastly Dragons, most of them that have been encountered are dangerous and powerful. The transformation of their bodies has changed their abilities significantly.

And they don't shun away from creating such corpses by physical force at all.With quite an arsenal of natural weaponry they actively attack when they are 'fertile'. While out of seeds to spread, the stalking stalks become inert and hide in the thickets by perfect mimicry, becoming inanimate and appearing as a perfect copy of a number of other plants common in Gnomprona. This ability has fascinated scientists as the stalking stalk seems not limited to one form to shift into. There are experiments in progress that try to find out how exactly this ability works and how the limits are defined. Specific stalks seem to be limited to a set amount of other plants to mimic, though those might vary from stalk to stalk. To entice the stalks to shift into any plant which is not native to Gnomprona have not yet met any success at all.Their resilient seeds are even more dangerous to the carrion eaters of Gnomprona. The seeds often resist most digestive tracts of the local creatures, but more often than not begin to sprout while still in the stomachs of such creatures. The blooming stalk takes root in the intestines of it's victim and begins to grow util it finally kills it's carrier and a new stalking stalk bursts out. The dependence on such hosts leads to another odd characteristic of its sprout, as it closely resembles that of other, harmless plants, likely to entice other creatures to eat them and become their new host, as they are able to regress their essence back into a new seed to sprout again. It's easy to assume but next to impossible to proof the shared heritage of the stalks with other known animated plants that are way more common on the surface world and it's debatable if such plants lost some of the stalking stalks abilities in more fertile areas or if the stalks evolved separately and developed such features only 'recently' to cope with Gnomprona's hostile environment.",

It is said that the entire continent was once given to them by the gods. But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said. It is said that out of all Anuma, the sun god Suon loved the gryphons most whereas his wild sister Fafnar favoured the manticores. Gryphons mate for life and if either partner dies, the other will continue the rest of its life alone and never search for a new mate. They live very reclusive and love the high mountain peaks of Kilmaresh. In very rare cases, a gryphon will forge a bond with a human it regards worthy. If this happens, the gryphon will agree to carry the mortal on its back which is considered the highest possible honour by the people of Kilmaresh. As gryphons are Suon's holy animals, the inhabitants of Kilmaresh decorate the sun god's temples with gilded gryphon eggs. To get the rare egg shells, chosen members of a temple will undertake a pilgrimage to the gryphon nests high in the Kilmaresh mountains. If they find a pair that recently hatched fledglings, they will offer presents to the parents and ask for the leftover egg shells. Mostly the gryphons benevolently agree and gift their now empty eggs to the human priests. The mortals will bring the egg shells to the respective temple, where the eggs are blessed, gilded on the inside and filled with onyx sand. Mostly they are used to hold incense sticks that are burned in the temples or gravesides.",

Usually of a build somewhat more muscular and hardy than the regular Corym, they have many responsibilities in the Corym society. They are the guards that keep vigil over the den and all resources. They craft the crude but mean weaponry of the Corym, and repair stolen or found goods to render them suitable for Corym usage. Most importantly, certain Vanguards are responsible for keeping the slime tunnel system running. The slime tunnels are a well-kept secret of the Corym and work with specially prepared slime and swamp gases to provide long-range transport between remote Corym dens, in a way everyone else would consider rather disgusting as well as insanely dangerous. The gruesome accidents in the tunnel system are usually discarded as the failure of a charm the deceased, or crippled user had been wearing.There is nothing a Vanguard cannot put to good use. They collect all kinds of stuff, broken or new, and stockpile it for later use. It is a great disgrace for a Vanguard not to have something somewhere, for to at least temporally fix something or rather, everything - aside from their ordinary tasks, most Vanguards consider themselves inventors. Whenever possible, they mix and match the pieces of their collection with each other, often with no clue as to what it is they are working on. Most of the time, the outcome is completely unreliable or unusable; a fact no Vanguard would ever admit. Inasmuch as possible, they convince others to wear, use or try out their inventions. Given the fact that there are only very few volunteers, this is usually handled by a complex system of 'I owe you'. When someone accepts a favour from a Vanguard, he should expect to become a test subject of some kind of invention at a future point.The Vanguards are more robust, better trained and far better equipped than their kin. In times of war, they are therefore found in the front lines of battle; and even in combat, the Vanguards like to try out something new. As this is not merely limited to weapons, but includes all kinds of tactics and attacks, the Vanguard is quite an unpredictable opponent always full of nasty surprises.",

After untold time in Zarganash only the most adaptive of these creatures survived, but not unscarred. Zarganash has changed then permanently, trapping them for all eternity and binding their essence to the realm itself. Their self-awareness became bound to the essence of the plane in a twisted way. Should their material form ever be destroyed a gruesome fate of eternal torment awaits their consciousness. Forever will they ride helplessly with the storms and currents of Zarganash to be grinded down and reconstructed constantly. A fact they are aware of all to well, which makes them fight for their lives even more fiercely and desperately. Though the inner torment that is prevalent in Zarganash has already took deep roots in their essence and inherently changed them, some of them might still half-heartedly do the biddings of their demonic masters but they do so only out of an attitude of resignation and habit that grows more and more distant over time. In truth for a long time they have already given in to the despair and atrophy that permeates the realm and unknowingly became agents of the powers behind the curtains of Zarganash. While most of them are unknowingly doing the bidding of the pale worm and spread its taint wherever they go, they still think of themselves as free beings and would actively fight the worm and its minions. The subtle strings that the worm and others use on them usually prevent them from coming anywhere near the true plots that are played out in Zarganash. How much resistance against the will of the pale worm a brachiodemon could muster varies probably highly from individual to individual but the worm will always win in the long run.",

It is said that even minor books leak their knowledge a little. If enough books in an area leak such knowledge, it interacts with other sublime knowledge in an area. Eventually the concentration of knowledge leads to the existence of what in lack of better terms is called a knowledge elemental. It is raw knowledge and power set free. It has only a mockery of sentience, truly no more than an irritating and misleading mirroring of knowledge fragments. The knowledge has only one purpose: to be known. Yet it's heavily fractured and raw, not fathomable to an ordinary mind at all. In their attempts to insert itself to others, the knowledge elemental becomes an aggressive threat, as it attempts are harmful and even lethal. The sudden outbursts of knowledge are disrupting and destructive, often taking the shape of spell-like effects. Magicians usually have to exorcise such manifested knowledge from their libraries. Given the relative commonness at certain areas, many libraries accept them as a given and rather use spells to ward them away from their bodies, instead of dispersing them. Though such wards are relatively complicated they are usually permanent and less of an effort than to fight knowledge manifestations again and again. As it occurs an area can only sustain a given number of knowledge elementals at all, so if one manifested another is highly unlikely. A place that could create more then a few knowledge elementals at a time, would have to contain absurdly high levels of knowledge and can be discarded to the realm of pure fantasy and wishful thinking of knowledge seekers and cultists.",

Over time they figured out how to arrange the psionic runes to create certain effects. The hovering of the flying books was the very first breakthrough in this area. In the centuries that followed, the squid race honed their skills and created a own caste of 'authors' to create weaponized books with psionic powers that emulate spells. Most of these tomes are hidden from the eyes of foreigners in their hidden enclaves. But the rather common flying books accompanied their squid masters to many of the laces they went to. The flying books are so mundane and replaceable for the squids, that they don't take great care of them and just leave them behind when they leave an area. Sometimes skillful magicians managed to re-purpose the flying books and subvert their control by binding them to their own. Though not particular more powerful then comparable bind golems the sheer rarity of flying books outside the squid community make them a prestige object for many aspiring magic users. Warnings that those books might have been just 'allowed' to be found and repossessed to allow the squids spying on others have yet to be proven and haven't stopped many from acquiring such a prestigious object. The idea that a device could constantly transmit information to its creator does nothing to diminish its popularity in comparison of the need of many to show off. That way flying books have been introduced to many places in the known world. Some failed attempts to overwrite the books initial conditioning have even lead to the creation of 'rogue' books that roam around on their own in their mindless pursuit of whatever random impulse might guide them in the moment.",

But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.It is told that the bashmu were created when some of Fafnar's tears fell into the sea. At first they lived beneath the waves but as they owe their existence to a goddess of sun and heat, they were soon drawn to the hot and dry steppes of Kilmaresh. Yet they missed the salt they got accustomed to in the waters of the ocean. This is the reason why the bashmu retreated to places where they could find natural deposits of salt, mainly subterranean caves. There, the halophilic creatures subsist on the deposited salt veins and eat them up entirely before moving to other habitats. Rumour has it that the most powerful bashmu have seven tongues, eight arms and four wings. As of yet, nobody has ever seen such kind of bashmu, so it remains unclear whether they really exist.",

They were another application of techniques learned in the creation of the glooth golems and similarly ill understood in their design principles. Yet they were by far more simple and reliable. This all changed when famous inventor Jaccus Maxxen returned from a years long travel through the world. The man that formerly was seen as shy and reclusive if not a bit strange returned as a changed man. People say a strange fire burnt in his eyes, a feverish shimmer that probably foreshadowed the things to come. He never spoke about the things he had seen or learned in his travels. All that he gave away were strange mocking comments about the futility of life and the things that foolish humanity had yet failed to grasp. In his first and last appearance before the conclave of scientists after his return he delivered a feverish speech so full of insults and hatred that he had to be removed after less than five minutes. He retreated into his laboratory never to be seen again. For months there was no contact with the outside world and by day and by night there was a constant noise of work and machinery. After a while the officials became more and more suspicious and sent a task force to bring Maxxen to the conclave. They went to his laboratory and demanded that he came out. After they got no answer they begun to pry the doors open, only to see them thrust wide open from inside. What emerged though was not Maxxen himself but a veritable army of riderless walkers that were augmented with additional weaponry. The machines broke through the city guards and left a trail of blood and destruction through the city before they parted and vanished out of the city. Maxxen himself was never found, only a bunch of burned notes remained from him. Some assume that he vanished in the chaos, using one of the walkers as a mount. Others claim the guards found certain gruesome evidence that suggested otherwise but they were forbidden to talk about. The Maxxen walkers are still encountered at different places, seemingly following some discernible agenda. Although they are ordered to be destroyed on sight even after years there is a considerable number of them around so that it is impossible that all remaining walkers are part of the first batch that escaped the laboratory. How and where new autonomous walkers are built is yet another riddle in the strange story of Jaccus Maxxen.",

The term Insect Swarm describes a common threat. While not strictly evil, Insect Swarms are often aggressive and dangerous. One of the greatest dangers of an Insect Swarm is that it can be encountered almost everywhere and often unexpectedly. Sometimes, rather harmless insects form swarms out of coincidence and disperse after a while. However, if someone provokes the forming of such swarm, he better prepares for the worst.

The sea devils hunger for more such fear and are drawn to the poor souls that might share it. By devouring them, they gain more and more power and solidity until they reach their final form that can be encountered by travellers in Zarganash. Yet they won't stop there of course and continue to devour more and more souls of the drowned which makes then fat and bloated eventually. Though consisting of the souls of the drowned or lost at sea, they don't shy other entities, living or dead. In fact living beings seem to be special morsels for this ravenous creatures. When they acquired enough such spiritual energy, they retreat to the depths of Zarganash, where they split in halve. In that way they can actually reproduce. It can be assumed that there was a first bony sea devil that was the progenitor of these creatures that share his form. If and where this creature still exists is subject to whispered legends amongst the otherwise jaded travellers of this deepest level of the netherworld. As long as the bony sea devils are around it seems unlikely enough souls of the drowned will find together to form another progenitor with different qualities and appearance, but it can't be ruled out. How the sea devils will react to such a competition is yet to be seen. Strangely enough the usually not very social sea devils are very protective towards bloated sea devils that are soon splitting. It is assumed that this behaviour is a distant remnant of their life in the physical world, yet since there is no such a thing as pregnancy amongst fish it still seems somewhat curious and might hint at something else entirely. Since they heavily rely on the souls of the drowned, there is a rumour that the sea devils get agitated even days before a great storm is boiling up in the realms of the living. On the other hand this might be Zarganash's equivalent of sailor's yarn.",

Their fur has a golden shimmer and their eyes remind of radiant emeralds. Also they act in a more intelligent way when preying and therefore are more dangerous than the customary lion.

Rumours are indeed all that there is to know for sure about the shadow pupils. The shadow pupils themselves are uncommunicative to the point of being cryptic, and when addressed either reply very monosyllabically or ambiguously, as if answering something, or someone, else. They can be found where light and darkness intermingle, and seem to be monitoring things as well as building some strange shades, shrines or artificially interlaced bone piles of yet unknown use. Often, they are seen to draw strange faces or gruesome, half animal half demon-like shapes on the floors, that none dare step on. The other dark summoners suspect those to be portals to a shadow realm, and that the shadow order plots for total dominion and seeks to cloak the world in some strange unlight. Some even say that the shadow pupils are in fact not men, but several shadows inhabiting a body together, trying to prepare the way for some demonic shadow being or planning to shroud the world, consuming all living beings therein, until nothing but shadows remain. As those words savour strongly of paranoia, other necromancers do not like to dwell upon these reflections, and just try not to mention or catch the eye of a shadow pupil.",

It is their nature to destroy, to kill and to devour. Though intelligent, it is rarely known of such an elemental to control their anger long enough to be reasoned with. Even though they are not truly allied with the demonic forces, their desire to fight and to destroy more often than not has put them into uneasy alliances of destruction. Sometimes demonic overlords even manage to cull the massive fire elementals into servitude. It is said that some truly powerful magicians also managed this feat. There are also ancient rumours of something that the massive fire elementals desire above anything else; a desire in them burning so hot that it even pales their hatred. With this as bargaining tool, in the past some creatures managed to enlist the help of these elementals. Others knew long-lost spells to bind the elemental forces to their will. Thus vast armies of fire elementals, lesser and great, marched in the battles of the god wars. Several places in the known world still bear the mark of their doing, even after all these centuries. For now, the threat of another such attack seems unlikely and no greater numbers of massive fire elementals in our world have yet been encountered. Gnomish intelligence reports, however, speak of fire elementals of all kinds in the service of the enigmatic rulers 'below'. If they are servants, allies or only attracted by the mayhem and heat attributed to the activities of 'those below', is up to speculation. All evidence suggests though that there are far more of them left in the world than was assumed for a long time.",

Like some other demonic creatures, they seem to feed, at least partially, on the fear of their victims. Divination magic revealed that they are no native denizens of our realm, however, the question where Nightstalkers actually come from is still unanswered. They are cunning and intelligent creatures that are even able to talk our language. They prefer lairs in dark and abandoned places like ruins and caves. Sometimes, Nightstalkers form small colonies, but most of them are notorious loners.Sages speculate that the Nightstalkers' wish for loneliness results from their life cycle. At certain stages in their life, they leave the company of their kin to become lonely prowlers that secretly stalk the settlements of civilised creatures to haunt particularly their children. During these stages, Nightstalkers seem to dematerialise, almost like ghosts. They feed on the fears of those around them and adopt features derived from these subconscious fears. Luckily, Nightstalkers also gain a certain vulnerability in this state. After some while, Nightstalkers gradually retransform to their original state. Once they have reached it, they seem to hibernate for a while, which surely explains why they tend to leave civilised places in advance of the transformation. Thereafter, they live for a longer period in their natural state in which they might be encountered at remote places. During this phase, they do not actively prey on creatures but are more than ready to rip anyone in pieces who gets close to their lairs.",

The days of this ancient glory are long gone but unlike other races of the past, the Bonelords managed to survive the decline of their power. Parts of their former power exist along with small groups or loners who took refuge in some ruins or caves. Some reluctantly allied themselves with other races or enslaved weaker creatures to do their bidding. Using bribes or threats, some overlords managed to hire Bonelords into their rank. Such 'labour contracts' are only temporary at best and chances are that a Bonelord is more concerned about plotting revenge or betrayal on its 'master' than to do his bidding.Bonelords are accomplished magicians of great intellect. The latter is rather alien to human standards and it is not easy to understand a Bonelord's motivations and philosophy. With their natural affinity to the necromantic arts, the Bonelords still claim some areas of land as their own and guard them with the help of their undead minions. They are hostile to most other races which they consider as upstarts and primitive. They fiercely defend their realms or places they claim for their own, and their interest in fresh corpses for their necromantic studies makes them a threat for each human community. Since their population grows only slowly, they envy and hate the more fertile races which, in their eyes, stole the power that rightfully belonged to the Bonelords. Seeing themselves as a superior 'conqueror race', they gather their undead forces and pursue their studies aiming at the day on which they will raise an unstoppable army of powerful undead creatures to lead them to another war to conquer the world.",

At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.Wereboars are wild and boisterous, though a bit imprudent. They are not true predators, but in their ferocity and aggressiveness they are as dangerous as any beast of prey. Their appearance is a mix between a boar and a human being.The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

Whenever someone dies in the bogs, he is often in great fear or desperation. In many cases, these fears tie the spirit to the world of the living. Trapped between the worlds, these spirits become more and more desperate. They contaminate the environment by spreading their fear and desperation, and they bind rotten plants to the bones of their mortal remains. After several years, the spirit combines with its newly formed body and a new creature is born - a dreadful Bog Raider rises from the swamps. The new body consists of the skeleton that belonged to the living being the spirit used to be, wrapped round with masses of rotten plants, leaves and vines.Still driven by fear and often completely mad, Bog Raiders walk the swamps. However, their mad and frightening wailing warns all creatures of their approach. Hungry for life, Bog Raiders attack every living being that crosses their way, vainly trying to gain their enemy's life force to satisfy their tormenting hunger. Bog Raiders are rather driven by madness than by intelligence which makes them to dangerous enemies. However, there are also reports of Bog Raiders who overcame their madness and actually help nearby settlements or look after their former families from a distance.",

Besides fighting with it, a clomp uses its horn to scrape away mud in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Clomps form a variety of social groupings. Adult males are generally solitary, except for mating and fighting. Adult females are largely solitary when they are without calves. Mothers will stay close to their calves for up to four years after birth. Yet sometimes clomps congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Salt licks are very important because of the essential nutrients the clomp receives from the salt - provided it's not the toxic salt of the dried seas and rivers which cover the entire peninsula of Krailos. The clomp is herbivorous, eating diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Clomps are the largest animals in Krailos, but although they are very strong and have a reputation for being tough, they are quite easily hunted by the ogres, as the clomps visit water holes daily and can be killed while they drink. The ogres mainly hunt them for their meat and thick fur, but the large horns and bones are also used for ogre implements.",

        "text": "Ogres are large, downright monstrous in appearance, considerably dwarfing even tall orcs. They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve.Ogres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. Although the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity.Most male ogres come in two varieties, brutes and savages. Their main task is to fight for the clan or to scout the steppe for something edible. Ogre brutes specialise in hurling boulders and brute force, punching and crushing their enemy with their enormous body weight. Sometimes, however, they may also carry a single large club or heavy axe for emphasis.",

        "text": "The Mantosaurus is a curious creature that has no known relative on the above world - or the underworld for that matter. Given its viciousness and prowess it seems strange that such a creature would have died out elsewhere but given their brutal mating habits it's less surprising. The Mantosaurus has no gender per se. Their mating is a brutal fight in which the winner injects his genetic material into the looser, which physically, though temporally transforms said creature in being able to gestate an offspring. Births are also rather brutal and bloody too and often leaves the dying 'mother' as the first meal of its offspring. If the 'mother' survives the birth though, chances are that it in turn feeds on the offspring. Given such a reproduction it rather wonders how such a creature couldn't have died out already but perhaps it hardened the survivors that much, that they stand a better chance in such an hostile environment. Even in a vicious and brutal land like Gnomprona, the Mantosaurus raises the bar of viciousness and brutality quite a bit. Their attacks and eating habits are wild and bloody. This creature leaves little to subtlety by rather attacks head on, seemingly eager to burrow its claws and mandibles into flesh and rip it apart. The only thing that keeps them from tearing apart even each other, is the presence of a local alpha Mantosaurus. Usually the most ferocious of the bunch it maintains its status by shredding any competitor into pieces. Now and then it's challenged by another Mantosaurus for its position. It is yet unknown what entices one of the creatures to try their luck in such a fight but it occurs occasionally. For the loser it means certain death, the winner holds a special position of respect amongst its brutal peers. An alpha Mantosaurus is the first to feast and every other Mantosaurus meekly abandons its prey if an alpha shows up. The alphas usually stop any infights of Mantosauri they become aware of, possibly to prevent any competitor to arise from such infights. If an alpha is killed by other predators Mantosauri fight over its corpse as any competitor that eats most of said corpse becomes the next alpha. If no corpse is available it leads to a massacre amongst the Mantosauri and the local alpha that arises is often left with little to rule over or might die soon on his grievous wounds.",

Even though they are still young compared with other dragons, they carry a strong dragon heritage and the consumed particles fuelled their strength even more.Their arrogance does not allow them to be something less than other dragons and so their temper is even worse than that of their dragon cousins. The feeling to have to prove themselves all the time makes them reckless and aggressive and with that even more dangerous.Frost Dragons usually get along well with other dragons for a while. However, mixed communities often suffer from prejudices and lethal infights between the species. Though the mostly younger Frost Dragons often lack the refined magic abilities of their cousins, they are usually more powerful when it comes to physical abilities. Their newly gained control over the element ice easily makes up for their missing command of fire. They still possess a quite impressive resistance against fire from their dragonic heritage. Unlike other dragons, the Frost Dragons do not live alone or in small families. Instead they tend to form flocks of frightening sizes. Flocks of Frost Dragons usually inhabit spacious lairs and claim large territories as their hunting ground which they fiercely protect against other predators.",

As 'specialists' they enjoy a certain amount of status amongst the crews that allows them to fight in the second row. By skill and training they become over time mildly accomplished distance fighters, although their ability is somewhat hampered by their nervous and cowardly behaviour, that invalidates any even slightly more complicated tactics. Without the backup of a hefty amount of cutthroats, the scoundrels quickly become nervous and confused. always eyeing and opportunity for a tactical retreat. Even with the support of fighters their constant shifting and moving has them miss more than one good shot. Their greater survivability is paid by a lower share of the loot. Though in theory they are the same crew rank as the common cutthroats, the latter look with disdain on the scoundrels that in their eyes survive on their expense. So in loot distribution they often violently claim a bigger share - which is still only little, due to the packing order on pirat ships. In return it's not uncommon that some of the most aggressive loot takers amongst the cutthroats are hit by 'friendly fire' in the heat of battle.",

In the hive area, they are often paired with waspoids in scouting missions and hit and run tactics.In the war of the hive against the Deeplings, the Insectoid Workers are the most basic troops. Although not as numerous as the swarmers, they usually last longer and are used at more critical points of interest. They often attack in concert with the swarmers and seem quite proficient to pick and take down wounded opponents.

        "text": "The Waspoids are the ever-busy scouts of the hive. They are highly responsive to the hive's wishes and can be found almost everywhere in the vicinity of the hive. As soon as a Waspoid encounters something tasty or threatening, it uses its powerful pheromones to call for reinforcements. So encountering a single Waspoid often means that all Hive Born in the area are on their way to assist the Waspoid in a few heartbeats. Therefore it should be killed as fast as possible. The Waspoid itself is, strangely enough, not truly aggressive. However, it displays a rude curiosity that involves stinging and biting of the encountered object which, despite its unaggressive intention, leads to a fight. The wings of the Waspoid are known to emit a highly annoying noise that can unnerve even the most stoic mammal. Insects, however, seem to be magically attracted by the noise and experiments seem to prove that the Waspoids are able to gain some kind of influence over insects that are not native to the hive. The experiments suggest that the Waspoids can control and lure foreign insects to the hive. Since it has been deemed as too dangerous to continue such experiments, they have been forbidden and it can only be speculated what the hive would 'do' to such formerly unaligned insects.In the battle against the Deeplings, the Waspoids are harassing opponents from unexpected angles, circumventing battle lines. They are an advance force that pierces the enemy's defence to disrupt the supply lines and reinforcements. Waspoids rather operate in small groups on their own than joining forces with other Hive Born. This way they can fully exploit their speed and their flight ability and so gain a considerable advantage for their army.",

        "text": "Demon outcasts are demons who have somehow fallen out of grace with their superiors. In demon society, this might happen for any reason and usually, punishment is swift and final. Sometimes though, annihilation may be considered too swift or too much of a waste. Outcasts are branded for eternity, and even if they manage to serve their way back into the ranks of the demons, they are still considered inferior and disgusting - if only because they remind other demons of how quickly anyone may fall. The treatment of outcasts varies with the whims of the local demonic rulers; some outcasts might serve as gladiators for entertainment, others are used as subjects for various tortures and experiments. Only in rare cases do demons bother to keep outcasts as prisoners; usually if they are supposed to be in possession of valuable information or particularly useful powers. The life of an outcast is miserable at best, and either way a constant fight for survival. The continuous hardships permit only the most cunning and resilient of them to survive, and their natural aggressiveness is magnified to an extreme extent. Outcasts are prone to going berserk, and even if they should somehow have gained their freedom, not much in their behaviour changes. Outcasts usually don't think in long terms. Surviving the next day and venting off their immense anger is everything that matters to them. Their only delight seems to be to destroy and inflict pain and suffering to others. Sometimes, that attitude has induced demonic leaders to use them as expendable shock troops or to unleash them in an area that should simply be devastated and made uninhabitable. Once loose, they usually feel nothing but contempt for other demons and are unlikely to follow orders from anyone but the strongest and most frightening demons. As there is no common ground for outcasts even with their own kind, they only \"join forces\" for some random destructive acts. If there is nothing else to destroy or kill, outcasts will soon attack each other, and therefore no organised outcast societies are known. Only recently, escapees of a demonic prison joined the ranks of the known outcasts. They once belonged to the entourage of powerful demon princes, and might actively act to free them or regain the attention of a demon prince. Whether this is only a temporary switch to older routines or a more pervasive cast of mind remains yet to be seen.",

In the course of centuries, a green slime tends to eat quite a lot of negative energy which usually comes in form of cursed objects, undead material, demonic remains and other sources. This negative energy slowly poisons the slime up to the point where the ordinary green slime turns into a black undead slime, consisting of a huge amount of negative energy. The undead characteristics make the Death Blob quite a strong opponent. Although it has quite some power and extra abilities, it seems to be driven by its primitive instincts and only aims to destroy everything in its way.",

Its sheer mindless aggressiveness compared to the obvious strategic deployment of the Magma Crawler can lead to no other conclusion than that it is a biological weapon which is very difficult to control. It can safely be assumed that it originated in the breeding pens of what the gnomes call 'those below'.If this is the case, it is bred for war and destruction. It is probably deployed to do maximum damage in underground environments. After a Magma Crawler has been set loose, it is usually abandoned. This explains why wandering specimens can be found almost anywhere underground, usually at the end of a path of destruction. As only male Magma Crawlers have been found, it is assumed that the female creatures are retained for breeding purposes, and to prevent the race from spreading excessively. Given the longevity of the Magma Crawlers, this precautionary measure is not overly effective. Some captured specimens survived for dozens of years without showing significant signs of aging. Considering the threat even a single Magma Crawler poses, it is not unusual for a group of them to cause entire cave systems to collapse. It is not yet known if the Magma Crawlers somehow manage to escape the havoc they wreak or if they perish in it.",

They only tolerate some of their smaller brethren and critters like jellyfish or sharks who live off their waste and pick their teeth clean for them.Not unlike dragons, seacrest serpents love things that glitter, and preferably build a nest in sunken ships or amidst a hoard of gold, in which to hatch their young.

Sometimes, material or even smaller hive creatures are transported in these hollow spots. On other occasions, they transport eggs or nourishing goo under their carapace. Is is rumoured that the hollow carapace enables them to float on the water and serves other Hive Born as makeshift raft, but such reports are rare and rather dubious. Until now, no one has encountered a Kollos away from the hive so such rumours are probably just exaggerations. On rare occasions, though, it has been at least observed that a group of Kollos builds bridges or ladder-like structures with their bodies which are used as passage by other Hive Born.Another observation seems more disturbing, though: Sometimes it seems that the Hive Born fight more coordinated and almost strategically intelligent when they are close to certain Kollos. This led to speculations that another, still undiscovered, hive creature might ride the Kollos from the inside and commands its brethren. However, until now, no Kollos that has been defeated had harboured such a creature.In the constant war against the Deeplings, the Kollos are only of little use. Unable to dive or navigate very narrow passages, they are primarily used to repel the advances of the Deeplings. Here they serve the other Hive Born as tanks and shields while inflicting massive damage upon opponents careless enough to get into their reach.",

As everything else they did not remain untouched by the realm, though. Usual drawing their power out of their natural element, they instead of fed on the rotten essence of Zarganash and quickly became more an element of despair than anything else. Through unfettered feeding on the vile energies of the realm, they quickly overcharge more and more and become unstable. At some point the element bursts into a veritable storm that breaches the realms and has the powers to suck in more elementals that might be drawn to the storm that occurs in their realm too. This is a highly dangerous process beyond their control, that more often than not leads to their own destruction and dispersion. Often their remainders are quickly devoured by other denizens of the realm, but sometimes they even manage to survive the process and reform. Given the number of existing turbulent elementals and the rarity of natural rifts that suck in new untainted elementals, it can be assumed, that the chances for a turbulent elemental to overcharge and cause a realm storm are somewhat common. With more active exploration of Zarganash by travellers, newest data might suggest that the number of turbulent elementals in a given area heavily influences to probability of an elemental to overcharge. If the elementals are numerous, the chances seem quite slim. If they are rare a realm storm seems very likely. The storms that they cause are dangerous in the realm of Zarganash as well as in the realm of the living. Only other turbulent elementals can roam then freely and even flourish in them. The passages between corresponding storms are random, short lived and follow the accompanying lightning patterns. So it's rather unlikely for a mortal to pass through, yet elementals that ride wind and lightning or an occasional soul are not uncommon to become unwilling travellers.",

On their torsos they like to wear beautiful silken clothes or ornate armour as well jewelry like rings, bracelets and bangles on their arms. The lower snake body is usually free of clothing, but will be protected with armour if necessary. Nagas are resistant to poison and have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic. Much like most snake and reptile species, they dislike cold climates.Nagas are an old, powerful and proud race who live on the jungle island Marapur since several millennia and built up a remarkable culture there. Their cities are said to be filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures. Their power makes them potentially dangerous to humans. However, many of them act rather benevolent towards the two-legs, as they call the humanoid races. If they are hostile and aggressive, there is always a good reason, be it obvious or not.",

Rigorous training honed their skills. Ancient and secret teachings in the arts of fighting and tactics prepared them well for their positions as officers and generals in the vast armies of old. With the arrival of the dragons and with them also the Draken, the star of the Lizard Zaoguns began to fade. Gradually, Draken took over the positions the Lizard Zaoguns once held. The proud Lizard Zaoguns were reduced to mere subordinates.Often nothing more than messengers for the Draken, the Lizard Zaoguns became embittered and their traditions started to change. The teachings about tactics became less and less important. The focus of their fighting training switched from an artful form containing ancient traditions and rituals to a much more aggressive and self-endangering style. The modern Lizard Zaoguns are elite warriors with little regard for their own safety. Their whole life is centred around triumph and spectacular victories. With acts of almost foolish bravery, they want to proof their value in a society that cares little about them. They seek the recognition of the dragon kings and the emperor with all means at their disposal. Though they are loyal to the dragons, they feel envy and anger towards the Draken who they see as usurpers of their rightful position.",

It's debatable if the factor in this change is really physical age or just the amount or quality of devoured material, but such thoughts become pointless when confronted with a ravenous mass of teeth that want to destroy you. Their power and ferociousness are strengthened over time as is their toughness. It's still driven by eternal hunger and shows no more restraint in following it's primal impulses than his younger self did.Before entering the transformation into a streaked devourer, the creature swells to twice its size and becomes rather slow. In such a phase it's extremely vulnerable and can hardly fight back. The transformation takes place in a couple of weeks in which the devourer retreats to a remote spot. In the end of the transformation the devourer sheds its old skin which had dried up and wrinkled away over time.Sometimes a devourer that is transitioning into the next phase becomes immobile and over time turns more and more into stone. It is probable that such specimens lack the right minerals to go through the whole transformative process to become a streaked devourer.In very rare occasions some specimens were encountered in a phase to transition between stages, but such creatures seem to seek out remote places and commit to their transition completely. The streaked devourers are usually loners and highly territorial. Thus infights are common, though rarely deadly. Only through some outer influence they are coerced into cooperation. If part of an army for long enough, their attitude to unwanted company seems to soften up a bit and they learn to cease their aggression even without constant supervision.The pheromone that streaked devourers mark their territory with is, in case of the 'domestic' counterparts, used in advance packs to mark a path that the main army can follow up later. Gnomish special operation teams reported some success in diverting armies in certain direction due to the use of salvaged pheromone glands.As streaked devourers become more and more magnetic over time, in some cases movements of greater numbers of streaked devourers could be tracked by using a compass.",

These dwellers of the deep seem to leave their ancient habitats for unknown reasons and seek new areas to live in. Given the warlike nature of the Crustacea Gigantica it is somewhat unsettling to think what might have driven them away from their old realms. As of today, there are no valid theories about this occurrence, and although the quara are often mentioned as a possible cause, it seems more likely that the real cause is a new threat that lurks in the depths of the ocean.The Crustacea Gigantica itself is not necessarily destructive but very territorial. When something enters their habitat, the simple-minded beasts distinguish only between food and robber. Both are to be eliminated by their powerful pincers. Their armoured shell serves for more than adequate defence in such cases.",

Yet as anything, Zarganash got a hold of, they can never break free from the realm and are trapped not only in the depths of the nether realms but also in their accursed state of ghostly denizens of Zarganash. Some described them as demonic entities trapped in ghostly bodies but in the end it's only a twisted mimicry that drives them. Ironically their emulation of demonic cruelty and behaviour doesn't differentiate them much from other phantoms at all. The key difference towards demons is that they lack any allegiance to the demonic hoards and the essence that fuels them is something entirely different. In combat their comparatively high intelligence and awareness is set off by their hatred and anger. Though in theory they are some of the more stable and intelligent phantom breeds, there is little chance for any meaningful conversation. Even if outnumbered and cornered, the infernal phantom will still attack suicidal instead of participating in negotiation. It is said though that stealthy observers witnessed gatherings of infernal phantoms in which they conversed with hushed voices in conspiratorial manner. If this hints to any greater plan or agenda of these phantoms or if it's just another mimicry of the demons is yet unknown.",

        "text": "When the long forgotten ancestors of modern necromancers in dark caves sang their ritual chants, those ancient priests of death often rose one of the most fearsome beasts their race had to handle. They focused their powers to raise the mighty Undead Cavebear to unlife. This vicious beast was one of the masters that used to rule the mountains of old.In unlife it is bent to the will of their summoners and spreads fear and death in the ranks of their enemies. An Undead Cavebear used to be not only a tool and minion, it was a symbol of status and leadership, not unlike a sceptre. Once an integral part of necromancy, the primal powers that aroused the Undead Cavebears from death have been forgotten and discarded in favour of more subtle magic that allowed more complicated creations.In modern times the questionable honour of rediscovering the incantations belongs to ambitious researchers of the past. The bones they unburied and that belonged to powerful ancient necromantic priests were stolen and served as paraphernalia to summon ancient spirits and teach modern necromancers their arts. The raw and archaic enchantments quickly spread through the ranks of modern necromancers and so more and more Undead Cavebears are seen again as minions of death. As rumours go, the 'modern' Undead Cavebears are joined with some ancient constructs that somewhere withstood the ravages of time thanks to their robust nature and powerful enchantments.",

In their natural habitat there is rarely enough food to support more than a handful of Wiggler in any given area. So in the distant past the Wiggler must have been a rare sight. With gnomes cultivating mushroom gardens and sometimes even abandoning them for safety reasons, the Wiggler found enough nourishment to grow significantly in numbers. By the time the gnomes learned about the significance of the rising threat, it was too late to turn the tide. The Wiggler has become a common threat for gnomish holdings and is probably even more threatening to other underground dwellers who are ill prepared. Wigglers are usually found on gnomish mushroom fields. As they are killed, more seem to appear. All the gnomes can do is practise damage reduction by eliminating this threat in the vicinity of their holdings. Still success, if any, is usually short lived. Worse still, with all attempts to exterminate the Wigglers every new generation seems to become a little bit more resilient and more aggressive. Where in tales of old the Wigglers shunned away from light sources, in our days they seem to be drawn to them instead. If the old Wigglers fled when discovered, the new generations fight back fiercely. Though not an enormous threat if on their own, their numbers and sheer limitless reinforcements make them quite dangerous, especially as the newer breeds have shifted their strict mushroom diet to a more omnivorous one that does not shun the flesh of living beings.",

The constant exposure to an environment that is significantly too cold for their taste puts the already dangerous lavafungi into a constant bad mood that they tend to vent off on their opponents. The fungi that are encountered in battle are only the lowest ranking members of their race and there are hints that colonies of more advanced lavafungi exist in the realm of Those Below. It is speculated that the fungi that are part of the army and advance forms are part of a lower, less educated caste of the fungi and the 'real' lavafungi wield sophisticated weaponry and armour. The lava fungi encountered in the armies of Those Below are seen as disposable and easily replaced.They are often used as garrison forces rather than as shock troops. Lava fungi are often seen in undertaking manual labour in garrisons and camps, to which they are more suited then most other subterranean minions. In greater depth and at locations of great heat they completely replace the lost as a workforce. All in all their relationship with the lost seems strained at best for some unknown reason, though it has been observed that the lost consider fallen fungi as a delicacy.Especially in recent times there was a surge of lava fungi troops in the armies of Those Below. It seems that the upper casts of the fungi have decided to take a more active role in the war.

Some of the more powerful and cruel demons even enjoy to 'breed' such ghosts on their own.

Still some demons lurk at the borders of dreams, watching, drooling with hatred and greed. Sometimes a dreamer gets some distant feeling of those unwelcome spectators. Such dreams often turn into nightmares. The chaos and fear, that is caused by nightmares, allow the lurking demons to steal some of the essence of these dreams. By eating more and more of this substance, demons gain certain characteristics which are normally not at disposal of demons. To some extent they are even able to haunt the dreams of the mortals, although their influence is only indirect and limited. Their physical form reflects their constant travel to a place they do not belong to and takes the shape of a ghostly horse creature. Their powers in the lands of the living are somewhat more substantial and often involve to weaken mortals and to steal their life force.",

However, when the nagas discovered that the giant beavers native to Marapur were easier to tame and less costly to care for and feed, they turned away from domesticating makara. So nowadays, most makara can be found living in the wild. However, they seldom come to the surface, mostly they stay under water, often in already sunken naga ruins.",

        "text": "The peculiar flora and fauna of Gnomprona hosts a tremendous amount of unique life forms. The discovery of the land in the depths of Tibia sparked a debate, if it rather preserves or created the special creatures encountered there. The current consensus seems to be something in-between. It seems likely that many of the gnompronean life forms are primordial ancestors of creatures encountered elsewhere in the world. Yet it seems likely that centuries of generations, tempered by the harsh primeval land have left their mark and changed the creatures over the course of time. The sulphur spider seems to belong to one of the latter cases. At first classified by some to be an elemental and less an actually creature, closer inspections of slain spiders have disproven this by far and wide. In fact these spiders are probably the progenitors of many of the gigantic spiders that can be found all over the world. Despite their visual familiarity to creatures like the crystal spiders they share more in arrangement of their organs with the well-known giant spider. This turned former scientific theories upside down and now scientists lean towards the theory that the sulphider is the evolution of a progenitor spider as the shared ancestor for sulphider, giant and crystal spiders and probably many else. Yet the special dependency their offspring developed towards sulphur seems to hint that they took quite a different branch of development. Still the sulphider is assumed to be the most closely related offspring of the bunch, when compared towards that progenitor spider. They build their lairs in sulphuric areas and their hairy body is usually covered with a layer of sulphur powder. Yet their skin tone has taken a yellowish hue, probably over many generations. Oddly enough their choice of lairs in rather uninviting areas of sulphuric caves, cracks and fields makes it necessary for them to venture into the gnomorean jungle to find prey. There they stand with their hue and are easily spotted. They make up for that by being very quick and agile, catching up to their victims with terrifying speed. As their whole bodies seem highly satiated with sulphur and derived, concentrated toxins, their yellow colouring also serves as a warning towards other predators to stay away. Indeed the flesh of the sulphider is highly poisonous and even a bite seems to cause any attacker discomfort and harm.",

        "text": "The scorpion was the symbol of the ancient dynasties of the southern desert. For the early civilisation it was the embodiment of war and deadliness. The symbol of the scorpion is found at many different sites. Statues of scorpions used to be quite common in temples. Ancient mystics filled some of these statues with actual spirits of scorpions, or at least with something of what they thought to be such spirits. The repeated binding of spirits into the statues granted them some resemblance to living scorpions. Even when the mystics disappeared, the Sandstone Scorpions persisted. Forgotten in ancient tombs, they endured the ravages of time. Since every grain of sand in the statues is imbued with spirit energy, the sandstone bodies can be destroyed but not killed. Given some time, the seemingly dead body will crumble into sand that moves with a wind that no other can feel to some place where it will reform its former body to continue its existence.The poison they use is rather spiritual than physical. The study of this poison led to the refinement of antidote magic as we know it today. Instead of countering poison with the help of regenerative powers as it was custom practice in the past, modern antidote magic rather exorcises the poison itself. While some temples tie this process to the god Crunor who allowed the humans to learn the secret of poison curing, most scientifically inclined magic users see only a mindless but dangerous machine in the Sandstone Scorpion. They argue that it is only following orders of summoners long dead. On the other hand, priests argue that the Sandstone Scorpion is the embodiment of an animal spirit and therefore sacred to Crunor. They claim that it is working on Crunor's behalf, testing the battle prowess of heroes. Both interpretations admit though that the Sandstone Scorpion is a formidable foe that is guarding the holy places of the past.",

Some of them work as pathfinders and trackers for some bandits, others gather in small hunting packs just like wild animals. Again others are loners - close to insanity who turn into beings that the locals call 'wild men'. Poachers can be found almost everywhere. They hunt deer and wolfs in the woods as well as rats and insects in caves. Knowing that travellers posses useful equipment and money, they don't even shrink away from murder and thievery. Poachers have little to lose and often disregard their own safety. Hoping for a lucky shot, they even attack much stronger opponents. Poachers are most dangerous when the victims are taken by surprise while being on a hunting trip. It almost seems as if they could smell the blood of a wounded adventurer as they tend to appear when someone is in a fierce fight with some wild beast. Travelling adventurers are well advised to have some backup healing material available while passing a territory known for Poacher activity.",

Moreover, Worker Golems own some sort of intelligence gained in a ritual not too different from the one which modern wizards use to create stone golems. With powerful runes and enchantments, some spirit have been called into the golems. Worker Golems are much more limited and specialised than other golems but they are also more precise and easier to control.The Worker Golems came in many varieties, serving as construction machines, transporters, guards and butlers. In the course of the centuries, more and more of the Worker Golems malfunctioned and deteriorated. Nowadays, not many of the old golems are left. Although some cunning magicians figured out how to repair, control and even create such constructs, the processes involved are extremely time-consuming and expensive. For this reason, Worker Golems outside of Yalahar are a rather rare sight, and many of the still functioning ones are badly affected. Such Damaged Worker Golems are of course much weaker and less durable than the repaired and intact versions.Though the initial commands of the golems prevented that they attacked a Yalahari, this instructions seem not to be valid for outsiders such as humans. This is probably caused by the fact that outsiders were very rare in the glorious past of the city, nonetheless, nowadays it poses a threat and often leads to fatal attacks. Of course, this is another point while Worker Golem are hardly in usage nowadays.Although the Worker Golem has become rare over the centuries, there are still some old factories were an unsuspecting explorer might encounter some of these golems mindlessly doing some kind of work. Worker Golems attack intruders with different built-in magic tools using them quite effectively as weapons.",

They lack any form of patience though and often leave one job to join another. Several Infernalists work as mercenaries and some even find employment in armies. However, their short temper and their eagerness to start arguments about minor incidents make them bad employees. Even the cults they belong to are not very fond of them. For this reason, they are often sent on dangerous or even suicidal missions in the hope that they will never return.

Only rarely they hunt in the wilderness; it is much more likely to encounter the hatchlings in their lairs, supporting their relatives in their fight against intruders who are foolish enough to set a foot in the frost dragons' territory. The hatchlings tend to attack rather swiftly and deadly as they have to see to it that they get their food and loot before somebody else of their kin steals the prey.",

Even though they do no longer radiate their race's greatness of the past, the Twisted Shapers still have an instinctive talent for the abilities of their forefathers. Obviously more cunning and intelligent than the broken shapers, the Twisted Shapers almost seem like a different race. Still primitive and wild, they are the leaders and priests of their kind. They are the ones that preserve the remaining knowledge and everything else which is left of their civilisation - which is undoubtedly very little.The uncompromising upbringing turned them into cruel creatures. Perhaps they have a vague grasp of what their people have lost as they seem to view the world with spite and contempt.They seem to wield magic instinctively rather than to work real spellcraft. Just like a dragon who learns to breathe fire without thinking, the Twisted Shapers bend raw magic to their will and hurl it into their enemies. Most of their art is as twisted as they are themselves and their spell-like abilities rather destroy than create. Their destructive flashes are by far more powerful than their instinctive attempts to heal themselves or others.Alone the broken shapers view them as gods and follow their orders without hesitation. The Twisted Shapers lead the colony like some kind of sect. They seem to invent rules and rites on a whim or follow some unknown inspirations. One from their midst usually acts as their high priest or de facto king. This individual personally teaches and grooms the leader that will follow him one day. These two Twisted Shapers are considered to be the most important and prized possession of a colony. As such they are fiercely protected and timely evacuated if danger arises. If we believe recent records of adventurers, every encountered colony, no matter how far away, follows this pattern. This astonishing observation raises many questions and speculations. There are records that a Twisted Shaper mother can give birth to a broken shaper child and vice versa. It is unknown though if twisted and broken shapers interbreed. This proves that the two species have not turned into entirely separate species yet, however, separation seems to be the way their race is ultimately heading to. Whereas the broken shaper children are left to fend for themselves, the Twisted Shaper offspring actually receives some kind of education by other Twisted Shapers.Some of the Twisted Shapers even seem to possess some ancient knowledge. They know how to operate at least parts of the artefacts left by their ancestors. Many of their rites, however, seem to have lost their purpose. The very few useful ones are used to operate objects such as gates, lights and other things of which the purpose is unknown to us. Even though, all they do is no more than a pointless mockery of their former greatness, the Twisted Shapers desperately hold on to it. Whenever they have to leave an area, the Twisted Shapers never forget about their home and constantly trying to retake it.",

Their sounds and their berserk behaviour often give the impression to be fighting a kind of kongra in a dwarf's body. Though the basher employ a variety of killing utensils with frightening skill, those seem strangely out of place in their hands. Generally, they daunt their enemies with grunting noises and threatening posture, before charging and unleashing their full ferocity on the battlefield. Bashers are usually the first to charge into battle - as a matter of fact, the Bashers seem almost incapable of engaging into battle without a charge - accompanied by yells that cannot mistaken for ordinary battle cries. In combat, they continue their unnerving bawling and intimidating behaviour, although they frequently display a certain cunning and seem to enjoy slowly bleeding their enemies to death rather than swiftly finishing them off. Sometimes, however, they fly into an animal frenzy, dealing out a series of vicious and brutal blows that betray their immense strength. Moreover, the bashers seem to possess an uncanny sense of direction; and since both their mindset and their senses are animal-like, they are often used as guides, trackers or hunters by the Lost, although they are easily distracted.It is not uncommon for bands of Bashers to follow their prey like bloodhounds, chasing them to death, often without any assistance of other Lost. Whether they have been dispatched by some superiors or follow some kind of hunting urge is subject to speculation. Dwarfs who wander around on their own, for instance scouts of soldiers cut off from their units, frequently become subjects of such hunts. The few survivors tell horrible stories about being chased by the bloodthirsty packs and in most stories, only the fact that another victim distracted the bashers, saved the lives of the fugitive.",

In fact, however, they are good flyers and prefer to build their nests in the high mountainous areas of the island. Moas are herbivores and feed mainly on buds, leaves and the fruits of jungle plants. Unusual for birds of this size, many moas have a preference for shiny or glittering objects. If they spot these and can snatch them without major risk, the birds will often steal such items and hide them in their nests. Moa eggs are of an intense red colour, which is why the shells are popularly used by the nagas of Marapur for jewellery and decorations. Both, moa eggs and meat, are also a popular source of food for the mountain nagas.",

His nomad tribe of orcish raiders employed a tamed variety of terrorbirds as mounts. The careless usage of the mystical water somehow mutated and fused rider and mount to a fearsome new creature, an entirely new breed of orcs, the rorcs. The shaman's delight was short lived as the changed minions were not amused by their treatment. They used their newfound prowess and scorn to overthrow and supposedly kill the shaman. Since then, the rorcs have sought out recognition by their orcish brethren. Some inherent urge drove them to seek out their own flock and reunite with them. Other orcs first greeted them with contempt. But after a first attempt of extermination failed miserably at the claws of the rorcs, the orcish warchiefs began to reconsider. For now, the rorcs are grudgingly allowed to live at the fringes of orcish territory in an uneasy alliance with their brethren. If the rorcs can prove their worth, they might be allowed to join the orcish ranks and bolster their armies. If the two breeds separate, as more and more rorc roosters demand, then the rorcs will become an unique tribe, looking for a place of their own, of course with violent force. Both options paint a dark future for neighbouring communities and the world as a whole. The rorcs are fearsome fighters, even more aggressive, single-minded and brutal than an ordinary orc. Charging into battle, they employ natural and forged weapons with ferocity. Often they are in some frenzy akin to those of the forest furies, with which they share their origin. Even in their brighter moments, they are creatures that look to prove themselves before the other orcs and their pack mates. Infightings between rorcs roosters are common and often lethal, as the orc-bird mixture leads to an aggressive pack behaviour. A severely wounded leader is often killed by some contender, even if the battle against some common enemy is still joined.",

Its spiderwebs are not made of silk but of concentrated ice which is extremely cold. The cold alone is sufficient to freeze most creatures to the web which therefore does not need a gluey coating. The poison of the spider is like an injection of pure ice. It painfully freezes the flesh and numbs the extremities. The good resistance to cold that many creatures on the Ice Islands possess makes such advantage, however, redundant. For this reason, Crystal Spiders have specialised in hunting warm blooded creatures that are susceptible to their special abilities. This includes humans, elves and dwarfs. It is unknown if Crystal Spiders can survive in warmer climates. If they were able to adapt to warmer environment where much more prey is available that is susceptible to their attacks, they would easily spread through the lands like a plague.",

All of them base their theories on the Stampor's astonishing abilities which nonetheless seem rather natural and not based on magic at all. Be it as it may, the Stampors that have been encountered were quite powerful and often a threat to travellers. This is not caused by an unusual aggressiveness of the Stampor, but rather on their stupidity and bad eyesight. They seem to mistake unknown intruders as members of other Stampor herds which they try to drive off. While a Stampor is very resilient and tough and can easily withstand the 'friendly poking' and spitting, for an ordinary human such friendly warnings can become life-threatening. They seem to be drawn to places aligned to elemental earth in some way and there were sightings of Stampors in areas to which they would be physically unable to travel.

On the other hand, the subordinance of the other herd's leader guarantees the loyalty of their herd too. In the social order of Ingol, that has been established by Dr. Marrow and his assistants, the Rrihndeers function as heavy workers as well as soldiers, guardsmen and police force. Their subordinance to the boar men has led to resentments of the former to the latter and often leads to violent clashes that the boar men only leave victorious because the rihndeers in lieu cooperate and coordinate better. Curiously enough due to an unexplainable oddity in their physiology, the rindeers are very fond of sugar and sweets. Yet their body reacts to sweets like to alcohol and put them into a drunken state. Even the sweetness of natural fruits an cause such effects. As a full grown, heavy rhindeer in a drunken stupor causes a heavy threat towards others as well as furnishings, Dr. Marrow's henchmen keep them on a strict diet of leaves and grass.

What matters is, that the nightmare created a ferocious beast that seems to feed on the fears but also the lifeblood of its victims. Albeit capable of weaving webs, the archanophobica rarely bothers to do so and rather relies on its speed and lethal strength. In its hunting behavior the beast displays an unnerving amount of cunning and malice. It's able to prepare an ambush and prepare its attacks with others of its kind. It also seems to enjoy the fear of its victims and is known to play vile games of cat and mouse with a prey, often relying on a series of vicious, power draining attacks rather then an early finishing blow. It mercilessly weeds out all the misshapen and weaker creatures born of the nightmare and in the long run may enforce an unnatural selection of the nightmare-born, that will lead to generations of even more vicious creatures, if the said nightmare can't be stopped. The only positive thing that might be said about this disgusting abomination is, that its brutal viciousness does not even stop at their own kind and the hatching of a batch of arachnophobica eggs is an orgy of slaughter and cannibalism that only a few of them survive - often only to be devoured by their parents.",

        "text": "The glooth anemone is a strange plant creature that is considered a parasite. The thing is, that this parasite is actually by far bigger than its hosts. The glooth anemone mimics the harmless plant, also known as glooth anemone. The latter is a major food source and habitat for the gloothworms which are essential for Rathleton's economy. The glooth anemone creature is able to deceive the gloothworms into accepting it as a host and then devours the glooth that they produce. Not only does it devour more glooth than the tiny worms can spare without perishing, the glooth anemone also somehow forces the gloothworms to produce excessive amounts of glooth, which often drains them to death even before they can die through glooth starvation. Due to this destructive nature, the glooth anemone had to cope with the extermination of its food source that it caused on its own. The glooth anemone copes with that problem by being mobile. Their mobility has brought up speculations that it's rather a creature, posing as plant than a creature that evolved from the harmless and docile glooth anemone to a predatory parasite. While in the past the glooth anemone was a minor nuisance, the glooth-production and domestication of gloothworms multiplied its food sources almost over night. This lead to an alarming increase of the glooth anemone population and they became a threat for Rathleton. Several extermination campaigns, mostly rather started to protect the glooth than the population, helped to keep the glooth anemone population somewhat at bay, but recently it was discovered that glooth anemones have adapted to other glooth sources like the spoiled glooth that often is flushed into the sewers but they are also capable of digesting glooth products over time. This means that the glooth anemone can be encountered almost everywhere which in addition to their mimicry makes dedicated hunts on them extremely difficult. When not posing as a harmless plant the glooth anemone is extremely protective of its food sources. It is known that glooth anemones are able to absorb organic material like flesh too but it's entirely unknown if that could sustain the creature in the absence of glooth.",

Most jungle dwellers seem to have developed some strategy to coexist with that plant. Outsiders however are immediately attacked with poisonous thorns that the nettle spits from a sack beneath its blossoms. It seems it has an endless supply of thorns and we have not heard yet of a nettle that has run out of them. It is not quite clear why a plant would attack in such a manner, but most likely it is some sort of self-defence that is unparalleled in the plant world. The lizard people have cultivated that plant to defend their dwellings. So utmost caution is advised when you encounter a colony of those plants, some angry 'gardener' could be just around the corner.",

If they retained some degree of sentience, they would rather wish to be dead, though.

Having endured unimaginable conditions, the mutated bodies are highly resilient and extremely strong. Packs of Mutated Humans can easily dismantle whole neighbourhoods within a single night.Driven by animal-like instincts, the mutants often form packs in which the alpha mutant leads his brethren on hunts and raids. Mutated Humans usually hunt for food rather than for plunder. Still, driven by old instincts, they tend to carry away everything they come across, only to drop it again a few minutes later, not even remembering what they had taken. Mutated Humans hardly ever use any weapons or tools, and only seldom they still wear the armor they were dressed in before their mutation took place.",

The most desperate and self-loathing souls eventually emerge as distorted phantoms. Unstable and unhinged even for the standards of Zarganash, the distorted phantom is on a futile quest to end its own existence. By angry attacks it tries to provoke to be killed. The harder the resistance they are met with, the higher are its hopes of destruction and the more furious their attacks become. They drive themselves into a frenzy and ceaselessly continue to attack without any regard for their own protection. In the end, even if destroyed, the distorted phantom is soon reformed at another place of Zarganash, to embark on its endless mission of self-destruction once again. Ironically the inner conflicts are what keeps the distorted phantom in existence and from slipping into oblivion. Only by resolving such conflicts the phantom would have a chance to find inner peace and a final rest. This though is due to its nature and the laws of Zarganash almost and impossible feat. Without any help the phantoms will never be able to overcome the conflict and since they attack anything, seeking only self-destruction such help is beyond their reach. Some of the wiser and enlightened soul that try to heal and mend the scars of Zarganash target the distorted phantoms first in their mission of salvation. But even those would be saviours risk their existence and are attacked without mercy. If unprepared adequately most of them even risk to succumb to their own despair and rather join the ranks of the distorted phantoms. Due to their self-destructive nature the distorted phantom are drawn to all kinds of natural hazards of Zarganash. so a frequent sighting of distorted phantoms is usually a sign that an area is unsafe or a disaster is about to happen.",

They show an intelligent design but seem to lack a specific purpose. The unknown creator, if existent at all, has yet to be identified. Some speculate this creator might be some avatar of rot and decay, somehow connected to the feared pale worm, that is still stuck in its infancy. The rotten golems are seen as the first, mostly purposeless actions of this enigmatic entity. Given their destructive and malignant nature this does not bode well for the nature of its nascent creator. The golems roam certain areas of Zarganash which are ripe with rot and decay, providing an ample and fertile ground for their creation. Their behaviour is aggressive and malignant, yet more sustained by a curious cruelty than any direct malevolence. While only spotted rarely in the past, sightings of rotten golems have become more and more common recently, though their appearance seems to be limited to certain areas that they prefer. A greater spread of the rotten golems is nothing to dismissed though, given that there seems to be an increase of their activity in general.For now they seem confined to certain areas, where they attack intruders with almost childish excitement. When not facing an enemy they seem to relish in random destruction of environment that also has similarity to a curious playing child. It's not rare that they hurt each other or themselves in such a process. This never leads to infights, however, as the others simply join the destructive play. Despite not actually fighting they still might tear each other apart out of sheer curiosity. All this lead to speculation that the rotten golems might mature over time and gain greater consciousness and intelligence. But in over 200 years from the first reports of rotten golems, such specimens have not been observed.",

Therefore they bound powerful spirits of frost and ice into their tomes. The levitating books accompanied them as companions and tools at once. With the vanishing of their creator race, the icecold books became inert. Hungry for the knowledge contained in them, they were stolen and experimented upon. The only way found to unleash their considerable power, was to empower them with a will of their own and bind certain arcane crystals attuned to icemagic into them as an energy source. Thus the books became self-sustained entities that had access to at least some of the ancient spells bound to them. They follow an icecold, yet somewhat malignant logic and can be reasoned with to some degree. Since their creators seemed to have had some deeper connection to Zathroth, they easily ally with his forces. Still they act on their own and might behave strongly unpredictable. Almost indistinguishable from them are newer creations that were attempts to recreate them with modern magic. Though less powerful and less intelligent, these copies are highly obedient to their creators but contain no bound knowledge on their own. Instead they use an array of frost abilities that work more with a brute force method than artfully woven magic like the originals. They are used to provide a reliable source of ice magic, that doesn't drain the mana reserves of its owner. Both versions can be found as status symbols of powerful casters. It is said that a high number of originals was collected and stored away by followers of Zathroth but even they were unable to unlock the final secret knowledge contained in them.",

The liodile is both known for either lying in wait for potential prey or hunting in small packs. In the confined space of the isle Ingol, their aggressiveness is kept in check by feeding them the remains of failed fusions of creatures. Yet they are still occasionally preying on fellow mutants and probably more by accident than design keep the population of Dr. Marrows experimental specimens at bay and relatively stable. As in natural occurring hybrids, the reproduction of Marrow's earliest creations was impossible. The mad yet determined scientist had his first breakthrough in that regard with the creation of the liodiles. Only later he retroactively altered the creation process of most of his other mutants with his new found knowledge. Curiously enough, the liodiles can fertilise themselves and propagate by laying eggs. They shallowly burry the eggs and leave them unattended, seemingly oblivious of their meaning. Liodile eggs are often stolen by other predatory creature and only a few of them are lucky and fertile enough to hatch an offspring. Liodile offspring more closely resembles its crocodile ancestors in the first few months and mature in shallow waters, were they are again targeted by bigger predators. Matured liodiles are regularly rounded up by boar men patrols and brought back to the laboratory area, where they are raised and trained to fit into the mutant society.",

        "text": "Ancient texts tell us about a time when the priests of the empire did not revere the dragons but one or more other entities. It seems that of all parts of lizard society, the priesthood changed the most due to the arrival of the dragons. In the last few decades, the old customs seem to have been forgotten if not suppressed, and an entirely new tradition was founded. Today, there is hardly any knowledge left about the dragons' predecessors.Although the Lizard Dragon Priests are a rather young order, they have been taught powerful magic by their dragon masters. Their skill in manipulating fire is rivalled only by few in the known world, and they enjoy conflagrations just like ritual arson. Still, the flame is seen only as one visual manifestation of the power of the dragons. Instead, they often use stylised dragons or items that have a relation to dragons as symbols for their belief. In their behaviour, the Lizard Dragon Priests try to emulate the dragons which is often mirrored in their fighting style.However, the powers of the Lizard Dragon Priests do not only encompass the calling of flames and blazes. Some of their apparent powers are not related to their reverence of the dragons. Whether their affinity to poison and corruption is a reminiscent of the past or somehow related to the dragons is still a mystery. Astonishingly enough for a culture so bound to traditions and formalism, the priesthood lacks proper ranks and offices. Instead an individual Lizard Dragon Priest may by skill or intrigues create its own individual office.",

        "text": "A Mutated Tiger is the result of outrageous experiments. In most cases, the mutation is rather a by-product of another process that aims at stealing the cat's vitality and agility to produce a youth potion that is of great demand among the wealthy and powerful all over the world. Although some of the most resilient tigers survive this horrible draining-process, they turn incurably mad and wild. In addition, these rare individuals become much more vital and stronger than they have ever been in their former lives.To the dismay of some excited alchemists, who had tried to drain those beasts to gain even more powerful potions, the vital force of Mutated Tigers is toxic. This, however, did not stop the alchemists to undertake further gruesome experiments. After surviving these cruel experiments, the beasts reached a point beyond madness and rage. They are the incarnation of pain and agony, and seem to want to spread them both as much as possible. With their increased power, it becomes more and more difficult to have them in their laboratories.Sometimes, thoughtless alchemists release the beasts into the wild, when it becomes too dangerous to keep them. Others are sold to arenas, zoos or curiosity shows. The buyer usually regrets the trade quickly - that is, if he is lucky to live long enough to regret something.Unlike to their former lives, Mutated Tigers care little for stealth and lying in ambush. They usually charge an opponent and try to overwhelm him with sheer ferocity and power. They seem to need immense amounts of food after their mutation, still if they have the chance, they kill much more than they could possible need for survival.",

Though they can take different shapes they favour a seductive appearance, for example in the form of young dancers. These demonesses are driven mainly by greed and envy. They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. There are several kinds of asuri. The frost flower asuri have pale skin and white hair, favouring clothes in the colours white and light blue. They are associated with ice and snow and prefer to use magic rather than weapons.",

They are able to crawl through even the smallest and most twisted tunnels, and reach places where other Corym can not go. As opportunity makes thieves, other races consider the Charlatans to be the worst of thieves, but by other Corym, they are held in regard as daring heroes. Their campfire stories are full of the exploits of the Charlatans, and detail how they outsmarted and outran their enemies. In combat, the Charlatans like to fight dirty. What they lack in strength they make up for in agility, and their attacks are often aimed at vulnerable spots and accompanied by feints, to catch their opponents off guard. The more Charlatans are involved in a fight to overpower an enemy, the bolder their attacks. Although they generally tend to be rather cowardly, most Charlatans are so convinced of the superiority of the numerous talismans and fetishes they wear that they will not back away even from a fight with more powerful opponents; and the Corym believe that through their talismans, a kind of supernatural power is bestowed upon them as well. They fervently pose as healers, diviners and magicians, utterly trusting their charms and ignoring all facts that might contradict their conviction.Charlatans are usually the first to be encountered if Corym move into an area, and if a single Corym is encountered, it is usually a Charlatan. On the other hand, as a saying goes, for one Charlatan you see there are always two more in hiding, and indeed Charlatans generally travel in packs. The death rate of the Charlatans is incredibly high and only the immense reproduction rate of the Corym still keeps them in existence. Oddly enough, most Corym that are born are found suitable by the Skirmishers to belong to the Charlatans. This is even more true in times of war. The Corym see this as a sign of their gods' favour.",

In fact they originate as Humongous Fungi that are so evil that they begin to change and ultimately end in destroying themselves.Their evilness materialises as deformation and an inner rot that drives the fungus to the brink of insanity. Hideous Fungi seems to not care about planning and safety. They are by far more often encountered alone than their yet untainted kin. Sometimes they are found wandering aimlessly in remote tunnels, often chasing something that they forgot about a long time ago. While the Hideous Fungi use their physical and natural abilities as aptly as any of their kin, their attacks lack finesse and often seem utterly random and chaotic. Their only interest seems to be to do as much harm as possible. Where the Humongous Fungus simply evil, the Hideous Fungus is pure destruction. It is not known if the Hideous Fungus is aware of its demise getting closer or if it is pain that drives it to these merciless frenzies. What is certain is the fact that the fungus seems to be searching for death, almost provoking it. Only recently some daring explorers might have shed some light on this matter. Not only have they noticed that from the dead body of a Hideous Fungus a group of Humongous Fungi will grow after a while, but also that their victims often fall mysteriously ill and die, seemingly never recovering from the wound they got in a battle with a Hideous Fungus. So it might be entirely possible that the rampages of the Hideous Fungus, whether an act of planning or not, might be connected to the reproduction of the fungi of evil.",

        "text": "The life of a pirat is often bloody and short. Those who survive more than a few seasons on the high seas become battle hardened veterans and are commonly promoted to more responsible positions. A pirate that acquires such a status will never grew bored in letting their ship mates know about it. As battle-hardened veterans of many campaigns they know how to wield their weapons with a certain amount of skill and finesse and how to use their expendable crews to the fullest. In a crew that has to be ambitious to survive, they have to be the most ambitious and resourceful of the bunch and walk over many corpses on their bloody way to the top. This leaves little space to make any friends though short lived alliances in a common goal are not uncommon. Each alliance ends in a foreseeable backstabbing though. As it isn't wise to keep enemies and competitors alive the death toll amongst aspiring mates is particularly high. Yet this unnatural selection leads to especially skilled and shrewd mates in the long run. The mates have little restraint to further their own agendas by sacrificing loads of underlings if this ensures to reach their goals. Their constant bullying enforces the pecking order on their ships and ensures the lower ranks stay in line. As disliked as they are, they become the first line of defence for captains against mutineers but also are prone to certain 'accidents' on board. They are also better equipped and fed then any of the lower ranked crewmates. They use a part of their extra rations to bribe some snitches in the crew to keep them informed about assassination attempts or rumours of mutiny. This tactic has proven surprisingly effective as it's rather hard to smell a rat amongst a Corym crew. Since a mate has proven that he is worth its cheese in numerous battles and survived several attempts on their lives from underlings and competitors for titles, most of them are scared or missing body parts. In the long run every mates aspiration is to get his own ship and become a captain on their own right.",

They are driven by malicious intents and roam the nether realms almost in a predatory way. Some of them manage to evolve into more malicious forms after a long time of existence. This is often encouraged by a dark mentor that already acquired such a state. Such mentors tend to gather a cultish following of mean lost souls that serve as their minions and army. Others band together in loose-knit groups of mutual benefit. Though relatively rare, their conscious efforts or assignments lead them into the more populated areas of the netherworlds that raise the chance to encounter them significantly. They often relish into inciting other kinds of lost souls to join them in their attacks by means unknown to modern researchers. The malicious component of the mean lost souls seem to be a vital and driving factor in their existence. If in some way pacified, the mean lost souls revert to an instinctive state of mind out of which they sometimes cant switch back. Mean lost sous seem strongly attracted to the world of the living and often try to cross the barriers. By their nature such travel seems impossible but the weakening of the veils between worlds in recent times could make such a breach entirely possible. What might happen to mean souls that manage to pass through is yet up to speculation with haunting manifestations seen as the most likely outcome. Other more disturbing theories assume that a mean spirit in our world would be able to feed on life and soul alike and become some form of revenant with yet in-gaugeable power. In the nether realms their presence seems to cause some kind of pollution. Their aggressive mean spiritedness seeps outwards and changes the malleable essence of the nether realm in twisted ways. Over time their continued presence has created foul lairs of evil, pockets of despair and corruption in which their nature seems to thrive. Such lairs often catch the attention of other beings of evil wandering the underworld. Sometimes they just join the lost souls that reside at such places, in other cases they outright kill or drive away the former inhabitants and take over. Some of the dark mentors are even rumored to have used the mean lost souls to created their own twisted kingdoms of evil in remote pockets of the realms of the dead.",

Although foremost prominent in the mentioned new founded kingdom the teachings of the great worm had a lure in several minotaur communities. Associated with freedom and renewal the cult is mostly disliked by officials and often forbidden. Such laws though sparked even more interest in the teaching that the rules deemed obviously to dangerous for their subjects to know. In reality most worm priests are individualists and self-proclaimed prophets that the great worm entrusted with special insights. There is no true unified church of the worm yet and even the few things that are considered basic teachings are up to interpretation. Most worm priests are highly skilled alchemists first, preachers second and always also accomplished magicians, often for some reasons defectors of the death cult. Most of their displayed miracles are product of their elixirs and salves, others are easily recognized as some basic magic. It's quite rare that worm priests work together. Whenever this occurs usually a very potent worm priest had unified them by force and guile and is pulling their strings. As a unified cult has yet to emerge, fights amongst worm priests and their followers against another sect of the cult are common and usually bloody. All sects regard Harraz, the first prophet of the worm as holy but even in the interpretation of the few of his passed down words there is no agreement. For now the cult is strongest in the clans of ZZZ where it originated. Since a triumvirate had been established as leadership it is in a good position to endure, but arguments in this inner circle makes progress slow and tedious.",

        "text": "Floating savants are reanimated husks that are inhabited by the spirit of a deceased scholar. Technically they are created from the bodies of burnt out guardians of tales. Sometimes the guardians absorb too much or too dangerous knowledge so their minds become destroyed. Not to waste their nigh immortal bodies, they are salvaged to host the mind of a notable Zaothroth scholar of any race who reaches the end of his lifespan. Through secret arcane rituals the mind is extracted from the dying body and fused with the soulless shell of the guardian. The process is not without danger though and often the transfer shatters mind and soul of the scholar. For most followers of Zathroth taking that risk pales compared to the opportunity to pursuit their quest for knowledge for an eternity. The new physiology requires a long time of recuperating and adjusting for the savants. Especially the floating is a difficult art to master for most. While newly created floating savants retain their original personality, over the centuries their new body with little need for sleep, nutrition and worldly pleasures changes their behavior and outlook on the world significantly. Emotions and most ambitions aside for learning as much as they can, become more and more irrelevant. While at first zealously follow their research of their mortal days, for most of them the pursuit of their original fields of their studies soon becomes too little to fill their new won time and they begin to widely broaden their fields of research. For some those studies end abruptly with their own minds torn apart by forbidden knowledge and their bodies been reused again. Others live through the ages, more and more becoming removed from the world in their minds. Constantly creating, evaluating and comparing new theories and concepts they have little awareness of their surroundings and pay little attention to things short of imminent threats and hazardous environments. Most places that house floating savants use arcane alarm systems for that reason. Whenever a threat arises, this silent alarm is raised in the complex and waves of arcane energy are sent out, that disrupt the concentration of the savants, so that they turn their attention to their surroundings. Obviously the savants are not amused by this disruption by mundane threats and react with anger, eager to return to their studies as soon as possible. In combat they rely on spells and the inherit abilities of their bodies although they are not particularly trained in the usage of the latter.",

        "text": "The eyeless devourers are no natural species in itself but seemingly something created out of cave devourers or even their streaked versions. Their eyestalks are purposely cut and they were probably put on a special diet or ores and organic material to enhance them further. This was quite obviously combined with some heavy conditioning. The whole purpose of those processes seems to be to create a strain of devourers that is more focused on battle than on feeding and more keen to devour organic enemies than to be distracted by their constant hunger for stones and ores. And indeed they seem more focused and battle-ready than their cousins. Their lack of eyes that supposedly enabled them to see sources of heat and magnetic fields was offset by a more keen sense of vibrations so they are not hindered much in combat at all. They tend to tag along with packs of other minions and attack in unison with them. It is rare to encounter eyeless devourers on their own without accompanying others as their entourage. Actually there are cases in which abandoned eyeless devourers had starved to death, waiting for someone to lead them along. Be mindful to approach such a lonely creature, however, as the presence of prey certainly will awake them from their inactivity and drive them into a hated frenzy.Another strange phenomenon that has been observed is the fact that other devourers will go to great lengths to devour dead eyeless devourers that have fallen in battle. While they usually don't shun to eat corpses of their brethren, they do so only by chance when stumbling over them after a battle. But every other devourer and other eyeless devourers are obviously eager to prey upon their corpses. This lead dwarfish prospectors to assume that their bodies ae rich of some unknown mineral and there was put some effort of metallurgists into obtaining and dissecting and melting their corpses. Said efforts have yet to yield any results, though.",

Though the initiation takes place behind securely closed doors, there are hints of blood rage visions, brain washing, grotesque rituals and blood transfusions during the final trial, and only those who live through these ordeals are entitled to call themselves blood priests, and receive a new name. Blood hands are often sent abroad to fulfil a mission of their master's or assisting him, and may return with strange devices, samples and stains. On the upside, blood hands are also skilled surgeons, and many an unhappy necromancer has relied on their skill to prolong his life or sew a limb back on, even if he had to pledge his services to theirs in return.In combat, blood hands use what their masters have taught them, and summon minions they managed to pressure into a blood bond, which usually means fellow necromancers who owed them a favour or two.",

Pookas emerge from mortals' dreams about gems, treasures and gold.Lately, some pookas on Feyrist are tainted by a mysterious, sinister force that is threatening Feyrist as well as the rest of Tibia.

The sulphurous chasms that are their habitat are rarely contested by other creatures so they can multiply in numbers that seem to concern even their masters below. The nests of the blemished spawns are often hit by exterminations by the forces of Those Below to keep their numbers somewhat in check. Seemingly some of the actions and expansions of Those Below in the past heavily disrupted the subterranean ecosystem and made the somewhat rare breed of chasm spawns an environmental hazard. It has yet to be seen how this hazard can be contained, if at all. With seemingly endless numbers of blemished spawns at hand, it seems obvious that some effort has to be put into turning them into a manageable army, else their presence on the battlefields would certainly be more prevalent. Still they are as unpredictable and destructive as the areas they use to dwell in. Only male specimens are taken into the hordes to prevent them from producing unmanageable offspring. In some rare occasions some blemished spawns are deployed in hostile territory to build colonies and multiply. In doing so their handlers hope to soften up resistance, slow down and disrupt hostile operations or make areas uninhabitable. Yet the blemished spawns are drawn to their toxic habitat and tend to leave if any more appropriate lair is around. Also outside their toxic habitat their reproduction rate and activity slows down more and more over time. So such tactics have proven ineffective and desperate at best. A new and alarming new theory of the renowned gnomish scientist Gnomespiracy sees a connection of chasm spawns and blemished spawns to the hive. The implications of such a connection would be devastating and put the identity of Those Below into a new light. As a source for such theories, Gnomespiracy has until now only cited dubious and unverifiable reports. Still, this theory has spread through the more uneducated communities like a wildfire and found many believers that claim that the authorities are supressing the truth.",

They also emit magnetic fields of their own, sometimes moving iron-rich earth and stones seemingly at will. In the right surroundings, Ironblights can even walk on walls and ceilings. Oddly enough, their prolonged proximity to iron lets it rust at an unnatural rate. Therefore dwarfs are particularly interested in keeping the Ironblights away. In the past, successful extermination campaigns have eradicated Ironblight presences from their mines for quite a while. The Ironblights are usually as patient and slow as the stone they resemble, only to surprise the incautious with bursts of speed and aggression from one second to the next. The Ironblights are immensely irritated by the magnetic fields that most sentient beings seem to emit. The highly sensitive creatures experience pain and agony in the vicinity of people. Yet this seems to kick in only at a certain low range, far too late to avoid the cause of discomfort. Therefore Ironblights often threaten bases of underground dwellers. Young gnomes had the habit of challenging each other as to who can catch the attention of an Ironblight from furthest away compared to the others, just to prove who is smarter. This rather unwise practice has been forbidden to gnomes by law and promotional campaigns with slogans like 'it is not at all smart to challenge death by teasing Ironblights'.",

Goanna eggs are a sought after meal for the human population of Kilmaresh. But as getting them is a dangerous task, they make a rather expensive menu. Goannas are found throughout the steppes of Kilmaresh. They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth.",

        "text": "Although the spittle of these creatures servers as a formidable weapon in combat, the Spitters original purpose for the hive seems to be entirely different.The Spitter can obviously produce quite different kinds of spittle. The most often observed feature is the ability to use some kind of gooey spittle that can trap smaller opponents and that becomes hard and resilient when drying up. It is often used to repair hive structures on the fly or even to erect some structures such as barricades when used by larger groups of Spitters. Since it takes some time to harden, it is only annoying and disgusting for bigger opponents such as humans, for this reason this kind of spittle is rarely seen in combat. In battle, they rather use their corrosive spittle. The use of this kind of spittle outside of war is somewhat up to speculations. It seems possible that it is used to dissolve hive structures that are no longer needed. The dissolved structures can be devoured by several of the hive creatures and later be used as construction material again. Adventurers that made forays into the deeper hive observed a third use of the spittle which seems the most important for the hive. The Spitters are the main feeders of the larvae in the hive. This kind of spittle seems nutritious for the Hive Born. It is not only important for their growth but also determines what kind of creature the larvae will evolve into. Though it has been assumed that there are three entirely different strains of Spitters, several observations disproved this theory. The Spitters are able to shift the usage of their spittle with little effort. They can be encountered almost everywhere in the hive although most times, they are only found in the major structures. Only in times of war considerable numbers of Spitters are seen far away from the hive. They serve as distance fighters and therefore play an important role in the composition of the melee-heavy hive armies.",

At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.Werefoxes are quick and agile, yet not very strong or tough. They are predators and their appearance is a mix between a fox and a human being. Like foxes, Werefoxes favour subterranean caverns as homesteads and are sly and cunning.The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

Even severed heads grow back within a few heartbeats and each injury seems only to increase the creature's ravenous hunger. The Hydra seems to flourish in warm climate and usually build its lair close to greater bodies of water. Although the jungles climate seems to benefit their breeding, it is not uncommon to encounter small Hydra colonies in milder climate as well. Other than their dragon cousins, Hydras shun the dry heat. Hydras are not known to hoard treasures on purpose but having been on this earth for quite some time, and only randomly losing a fight, the belongings of their victims have started to fill up their caves.",

        "text": "One of the most single-minded Lost yet encountered, the Thrower is often compared to some kind of insect by its dwarven enemies. The Thrower knows no fear, no mercy and no change of plans. It seems as if, once they have made up their minds or are herded to some aim, they are only to be stopped by death or by fulfilling their agenda. Though lacking the ferocity and aggression of their brethren, they share or even surpass their mercilessness, and their zombie-like dispassion forms an irritating contrast to the madness and bloodlust generally encountered in other Lost. The first assumption, that they were the raised dead of former battles, could be refuted, but the throwers seem to be completely broken in spirit and soul. It is pointless, however, to wonder whether they were broken for having a rebellious spirit, or if the raising in the slave pens do this to some of the Lost by default. The outcome is yet another killing machine at the disposal of the Lost hordes.Whereas other Lost bloodthirstily charge at the enemy ranks to engage them in close combat, the dispassionate Throwers are some of the few Lost to actually use long-distance weaponry, and use throwing axes to some efficiency. What they lack in precision they make up for in sheer force, and their thrown axes are known to bite sharp and go deep. Throwers often are part of the first wave of an attacking army of the Lost, but are also encountered in other fighting forces. Yet it is quite rare to encounter parties of Throwers on their own, and it seems that without the driving force of their brethrens' ferocity, they lack or forget any goal they might have had. They march and fight until complete and fatal exhaustion, ignoring their wounds and never leaving the battlefield, even if a combat had raged for hours or days on end. Where other Lost continue hitting a defeated foe in their frenzy, the thrower might do the same thing for the only reason that no one has told them to stop. Also, it has occurred that without leadership or examples to follow, they stayed so intent on a given order that they completely ignored enemies whilst marching to a destination point even under heavy crossbow fire. While being one of the less dangerous of the Lost, the Thrower is by no means to be underestimated.",

They consider themselves as the mothers of the minotaur nations and are extremely protective about them. In former days the amazon were respected healer-preachers of their faith and even tiny settlements often had a crone, providing knowledge and healing to those in need. Less prone to rage then their male counterparts they often worked as spiritual advisors and were responsible to calm those lost in their rage. Since the latter could be quite dangerous the amazons always received some form of combat training. After years of peaceful stagnation, the raising threats and pressure to minotaur societies led to a change though. Ralda, a wandering priestess took it upon her to renew their faith and change it through new doctrines. The peaceful and rather passive role switched gradually into a more protective and active one. The combat training became more emphasized and the amazons began to accompany their people into battles. This change gained more and more in momentum by it success and was at last adapted even by societies that never had come into contact with Raldo themselves. With this change what in the past had been an informal group of like minded people, became also a more and more formalized order. To become an amazon a minotauress had to be mother of at least four calves. Though they server the ties to their former families they renew them by becoming the mothers of all their people, sworn to treat and protect their nation like they did for their own former families. The amazons, though skilled fighters are also the caretakers and healers for their brethren and sisters. They are well educated and schooled not only in battle but also in tactics, logistics and several other topics important for the survival of their society. Most of them are skilled moohsicians, which is the title of the most skilful singers of the society and arguments between amazons are often settled in singing contests. Amazons are loyal for their nation first and their race second. They fight side by side with their nation even against other minotaur societies.",

It is impossible to tell if these creatures were once bred on purpose or if they are just some strange freak of nature. Their demonic nature gives them a more physical and reality-bound body, as well as the ability to breed. Their nightmarish origin bestows them several unique abilities and the resistance to the nightmare-ridden areas of Roshamuul. The shock head is disturbingly well suited to survive even in environments most hostile to life. To describe it as omnivore is an understatement since it does not only devour plants, meat and carrion without prejudice, it also consumes minerals, blood, life energy and even dreams. Its digestive system compresses everything that is not exploitable into rocklike structures that can be spat out like a bullet. Probably due to natural selection, the shock head population is extremely resilient, aggressive and dangerous. The regenerative powers of these creatures have captured the attention of alchemists that are trying to use several parts of the shock head as substitutes in health potions. Their eye-like organs are not used for vision, but as a weapon that can confuse foes in a distance and temporarily drains their skills. Lacking any form of intelligence, the shock heads are mindless beasts that roam the ruins of Roshamuul where they originated. Occasionally, large packs of shock heads band together at coastal areas for a strange ritual in which they howl to the moon in disharmonious unison, which is rumoured to drive listeners mad and trap them in eternal nightmares. Oddly enough, their bestial minds can be overwritten by certain means and they can be tamed. This process seems to be a permanent one, and has led to the shock heads leaving their original habitat of Roshamuul and breeding at other places. Inattentive and unscrupulous tamers helped to spread these creatures, and so they may be encountered in other places, since each following generation displays the normal wild and dangerous behaviour rather than that of their docile parents.",

On their constant search for new food, they often settle for other minerals in lack of greater amounts of cut gems. It seems that the crystals are used in the digestive system of the creature to pulverise other minerals.

Their territory is usually quite large, though they tend to stay in their lairs most of the time. Wyrms are quite intelligent compared to other animals.

Although they often take on a seductive appearance, they show their true form as soon as there is no need for charade. In this case they appear as tall, beautiful women with four arms, fangs and glowing eyes. These demonesses are driven mainly by greed and envy. They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. There are several kinds of asuri. The frost flower asuri have pale skin and white hair, favouring clothes in the colours white and light blue. They are associated with ice and snow and prefer to use magic rather than weapons.",

        "text": "The minotaurs know several sects with several purposes. The mooh'tah masters and the death magicians being the most prominent outside the minotaur society. One of the most secretive sects is what the minotaurs call the high judges. They are the sheriffs, judges and executioners of the minotaurs, combined into a single person. They are almost seen as mythical figures and are structured like a military order and a secret society at once. No one knows who hides beneath their shrouds and masks. They are faceless as justice itself. The requirements to join their order is as unknown as their recruitment process. They rarely talk to outsiders other then to proclaim a sentence. Recently the order has stepped forward from the shadows though and their grandmaster proclaimed a death sentence to all enemies of minotaurhood. This places the high judges into the first lines of battle. In the first encounters not only their battle prowesses could be noticed but it also became alarmingly clear that they are not short in numbers yet no one knows for terrain about their manpower. Another mystery is that there are sects of high judges in almost all notable minotaur colonies and they all seem to follow the orders of a single grandmaster, regardless of the colonies allegiances. How the different sects communicate and coordinate even on different continents is yet another riddle though. It can be said for certain that two high judges will never fight each other in battle but the sect rarely fight in inner minotaur conflicts anyway. Usually they travel alone and pass their sentences on those they find guilty. People may come to them to mediate conflicts or seek justice and the high judges will answer their plea ... for a price. It's commonplace to present the high judges gifts for their expected services. Sometimes a high judge might feel offended by the gift and leave, sometimes he considers it an insult and instantly delivers his sentence for the grievance. So usually the gifts to the judges are quite generous and a high judge can expect free food and lodging wherever he travels. The judges are seemingly bound in their doings by something they call 'the code' which probably is some kind of text with laws. The tricky thing is, that this code as almost everything else concerning the judges is secret. The ordinary minotaur can only guess by the sentences what the code might consider forbidden and what not. This leaves them with only a vague feeling what is forbidden and what not. Considering the often harsh punishment that the judges delver most minotaurs tend to keep it save and stay away from everything that even remotely could be considered a crime. The moniker 'execowtioner' was given them by human adventurers who first encountered the sect. Calling a high judge execowtioner though, is asking him for a death sentence.",

In fact, the gargoyles are wards and vessels for the various spirits that plague the whole isle. The first gargoyles were build as mere wards, covered with barely visible engravings of protective runes. They were placed all over the city and did at least ease the pressure of disturbing spirits a bit. Still exorcists were needed to drive out spirits from homes, places and people. Those brave people faced the problem that even exorcised spirits tended to reappear quite soon and they had to look for a more permanent solution. They needed a vessel to keep the spirits captured and bound. The gargoyles, already prepared to repel spiritual power became their first choice. Newly constructed gargoyles were no longer placed in the city immediately but stored until needed by exorcists. Then the exorcist would bind the spirit into the gargoyle, where it would be trapped by the wards. When an exorcist decided a gargoyle had reached it keeping potential, the gargoyle was finally placed at its final resting place. This procedure though was not without risks and the capacity of a gargoyle was as hard to determine as the strength of a particular spirit. This led to strange occurrences in which the gargoyles came to an entirely unnatural form of life. Whenever a gargoyle came to life it happened suddenly. It seemed that some outer influence triggered a fusing of the spirits to a new entity that would take over the gargoyles overcharged body. Those creatures are driven purely by instinct. Although not entirely evil and not actively hunting for some sort of prey they instinctively attack certain types of creatures, with humans especially enticing this aggression. Metal gargoyles are quiet strong and due to their spiritual heritage possess certain powers that resemble magic. They usually fight without finesse or greater tactic but their strength and mindless determination make more than up for that. In recent time unscrupulous entrepreneurs have sold huge shiploads of metal gargoyles that were considered already unsafely unstable as decoration objects all over the world. It is yet to see if their spiritual energy can fuse them into semi living beings outside the Rathleton area.",

The driving force of these creatures is an insatiable hunger and their digestion relies on incredible strong fluids. In the past the tiny ancestors of the devourers were used in Rathleton in waste disposal and they were deliberately allowed to roam the sewer system. First incidents with the nearly mindless creatures brought the officials to rethink that strategy. But it was already too late to stop the spread of the devourers. Even worse several extermination campaigns lead to an increased survival of the fittest evolution of the devourers and in few generations the slime creatures had doubled in size and fierceness. As a cannibalistic species they begun to further their own evolution by eradicating the weak and sick which lead to further selection. Some scientists speculate that the devourers are still evolving with each generation and that they will eventually grow even further with no limits. There are rumours about devourers that fused together in fearsome fights and continued as even larger and more dangerous versions of themselves. Even more alarming is the fact that the devourers are seemingly no longer dependent on glooth residue as they have not only spread outside of Rathleton but newly hatched devourers have travelled as blind passengers on ships and in cargo to different places and created new colonies. Wherever devourers are encountered officials are eager to exterminate the threat to prevent them from gaining a hold in populated areas. Devourers are not picky in their diet. Their powerful digestion system enables them to dissolve almost everything and they seemingly know no fear or pain. For some reason they prefer living food over dead matter and attack most beings without hesitation. Since they have some kind of preference chain they will ignore anything else if they deem something as 'tasty'. As it seems, humans are considered as incredibly tasty by their primitive instincts. Devourers are considered as extremely dangerous and the words 'Run! The devourer comes.' have become a common phrase in plagued areas. Given his resilient nature and omnivorous appetite only caution has yet prevented further spread of the vile creatures but it's sadly just a matter of time when this threat to everything becomes commonplace.",

There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. While the vanguard of the summer court are in general astonishingly disciplined and organised fighters for elves, the incursion of the nightmares have driven them mad and turned them against their kin. Vengeful for imagined slights and full of hate against anything not touched by the nightmare, they became a constant threat, attacking without any provocation. They still display the skill and training of their past but their clouded minds prevent them from forming strategies and the use of more complicated fighting maneuvers. They seem to enjoy slaughter and mayhem but there are reported cases in which they broke out of combat to indulge in a series of incoherent rants.",

Even though the lizard people give the Lizard Chosen a somewhat 'holy' status, they are not reluctant to use them for tasks that equal those of watchdogs.Their aggression towards outsiders combined with the remarkable abilities their tainted bodies have acquired, they make formidable foes. Knowing no fear and seemingly not caring for wounds, they are only focused on the destruction of their enemies. Although the Lizard Chosen have become more and more over the last decades, they are still rarely encountered in greater numbers. Although, there are rumours of whole colonies of Lizard Chosen behind the great dragon wall.Sometimes one of the Lizard Chosen goes on a killing spree in the southern lands. It is known that these creatures never stop or retreat and can only be stopped by killing them. The reason for these rampages is yet unknown, but the lizard people believe that the Lizard Chosen fulfil the wish of their emperor this way.",

Their natural organs are intertwined with organic yet artificial material, that resemble plating, tubes and hoses. Parts of them are seemingly stitched together (though the term 'stitched' is only used here in lieu of a more fitting word). The absence of such modifications in other observed minions of Those Below raises a slew of questions that are yet left unanswered. The most valid theory suggest that the technology and procedures used in the creation of the cave chimeras are the spoils of war with some unknown underground races, that are used or mimicked by Those Below without fully understanding them.Gnomish scientists have given up their tries to understand the technology behind those modifications as the whole approach to them seems utterly alien and immoral.Be it as it may the cave chimeras seem to be optimised for battle and serve as stoic soldiers in the forces of Those Below. In contrast to other minions in said armies they seem to lack the prevalent aggressiveness, usually displayed by them. The cave chimera seems bar of any emotion at all and only displays the most basic self-preservation instinct. They don't flinch or falter regardless how inevitable death might be. They lack any eagerness for battle but make up for it with their diligence. A lonely cave chimera will still attack outsiders, probably due to some basic conditioning.As many other creatures that make up the 'arsenal' of Those Below they are rather mindless and have to be controlled by others. Unlike other minions though, it seems they can be given quite specific and mildly complicated orders in advance, that they will unquestionably follow. Such 'pre-ordered' individuals lack any flexibility and are unable to react to unforeseen changes. So the might mindlessly walk against some gate that has already been shut and at least in one occasion a squadron of cave chimeras stoically walked into their death from an already collapsed bridge.",

The fact that the Lava Golems of our time are now in service of 'those below' can be interpreted in many ways. Given the facts, it is most likely that the octopus creatures were conquered and annihilated by 'those below' and their creatures enslaved by the vile conquerors. Now the Lava Golems serve as faithful and unquestioning minions of their new masters. The Lava Golems are astonishingly passionless in their duty, usually doing nothing more than they were ordered to do. They quite obviously lack the destructiveness and rage that seems inherent in the other servants of 'those below'. Their masters coped with this issue by obviously giving them a set of rather broadly defined and extremely destructive orders like killing everything foreign in a certain area. That combined with their sheer power and destructive ability raises them to a completely different level of dangerousness: in the end the Lava Golems have to be seen on par with the other minions of those below.",

        "text": "Another curious side-product of the so called necromantic smog that often plagues the Rathleton area, the rustheap golem is seemingly somewhat of the mutated poltergeist. Whereas a poltergeist usually haunts a specific place as invisible force that moves unliving objects, in this case the poltergeist seems to be fused with several items of scrap and litter into an undead creature that never had lived at all. Obviously this process is extremely painful for the poltergeist as is the whole further existence as rustheap creature. It seems that rotting and decaying objects over the time become charged with more and more necromantic residue energy, that they become spiritually sticky for some forms of spirits. Those imbued parts of junk eventually stick themselves to an unwilling spirit host and attract even more imbued junk over the time until the whole spirit soaked into a pile of necromantic junk. Thereby the poltergeists that are usually bound to a place or an object become mobile on their own but under the price of constant pain and strain as they feel their new junk body decay. Their answer to their misery is usually to lash out at everyone they might encounter. It is said that attacks of rustheap golems are especially painful because the creature transmits some of its own pain through the wounds into its victim, easing it's own suffering in the process. Without any real purpose and bound to an existence of suffering the rustheap creatures roam abandoned places oddly enough attracted by junk and decay. Some are even known to create their own lairs of junk and trash, probably in resemblance of their old place bound habits. It is impossible to exorcise a spirit our of their new junk bodies and it is yet unknown what happens to the original poltergeist when it's junk body is destroyed. Some assume the aggressiveness of the rusheap creatures simply aims at provoking it's own destruction but the fierceness with which this creatures fight suggest otherwise.",

They are often easy prey to the unnatural predators of the nether realms that feast on them in one way or the other. When not entirely destroyed by such vicious attacks those souls are changed forever. The 'leftovers' became more of an environmental hazard than anything else. Now completely barren of thought or purpose, they roam the planes before the afterlife with a hungry unawareness. Oblivious to anything but an unnameable greed they are drawn to live like moths to a candle. Their only purpose seems to be this need to devour, without even realising what it is that they want or need. Their hungry attacks aim to the life force of anything living and come close to damaging the very soul of the target. Perhaps with more sentience and purpose the attacks of the flimsy souls could drain and devour the souls of the living and actually change the state of their victims in horrible ways. Luckily such concurrences seem to be extremely rare but this is a development that is closely monitored by those who dabble into the knowledge of the netherworlds. The flimsy souls are frighteningly common and according to knowledgeable plane travellers and spiritualists their number has grown disproportionately in modern times. Despite their mindlessness they tend to occur in small groups and sometimes even form herds that jointly seem to search for an unknown target until they finally disperse after a while. Since they are hollow and bare of anything but the most rawest and stale proto matter of the nether realms other inhabitants largely ignore them. They are often found seemingly accompanying other denizens of the underworld, however, undoubtedly they are just following random impulses and stimuli forced upon them by their dreadful existence.",

However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a religious war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This was interpreted as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was rumoured that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and the worship of Fafnar is now forbidden in the new empire.But the cult of Fafnar still exists on Kilmaresh, albeit in secret. Her followers go to great lengths to strengthen Fafnar's influence and try to re-establish her worship. To achieve their goals they are not above using either infiltration or violence. The Burning Gladiators are a special part of the the Wild Sun's cult. They are fierce warriors who seek to enforce Fafnar's will with a vengeance. If necessary they also protect the Priestesses of the Wild Sun on their rather subtle missions.",

Since living creatures are often smart and quick enough to avoid the attacks of the blobs, any kind of plants, constructions and the like are usually not that lucky and are annihilated by their attacks.In the past, some eccentric madmen used Acid Blobs as waste disposal, which was considered to be somewhat stylish. However, after the Acid Blobs had digested a certain amount of waste, they started reproducing themselves multiple times which started to become a real problem. After several unpleasant incidents, this way of waste disposal was stopped, however, the results of such folly can still be seen at various places.",

        "text": "The dream-born are a reclusive race of creatures that are shrouded in mystery. Only recent events led to a contact that shed some light on these peculiar beings. There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. The vanguard of the winter court holds some tragedy. Their weapons and armor obviously hint at the noble past as part of a military order of a civilized race. Yet in their current state of madness, those are the only hints of former nobility and in their crazed eyes there is only a hatred that seems almost animalistic. The unturned dream-born seem reluctant to engage them in combat, probably in the hope they still can be saved. Given their probably infectuous nature, any pity seems ill advised though. Even if they are not mad beyond any help, it's far too dangerous to allow them to spread whatever cursed them to other creatures. The capture of a vanguard would be a feat on its own anyway, given their violent disposition with no regard for their own health or safety. In turn expect no mercy from these creatures that only seem to live for carnage and mayhem.",

        "text": "While animated skeletons possess no intelligence at all and are only driven by some universal evil, a Skeleton Warrior is indeed an independent and intelligent creature. Most Skeleton Warriors came into existence by free choice of will. Many of them used to be heroes or dutiful soldiers in life who volunteered to become the eternal guardian of some object or place. During their life, they were prepared for their eternal guard duty: they were trained in meditation, tattooed with powerful magic runes, and participated in arcane rituals.After their death, they are dressed in their best ceremonial armor which has further enchantments. For a while the corpse is as inanimate like any other corpse. Instead of rotting, these corpses slowly become mummified in the course of time. At some point, which may take years to reach, the Skeleton Warrior will rise into its undead existence. As Skeleton Warriors are unable to communicate, it is unknown where their consciousness resides in the time between death and resurrection. It is assumed by mages that the risen Skeleton Warrior usually begins his guard duty in a more or less sane state of mind. In the course of years, the once devoted warrior becomes more and more aware of his state and the consequences of his decision. Such knowledge slowly erodes the minds of all but the most stable beings. Moreover, the spells preserving the guardians are often more powerful than the ones on the guarded objects. So often, the guarded object is destroyed after some time leaving the Skeleton Warrior without any purpose. This ultimate futility of their sacrifice breaks the mind of even the most strong-minded individuals and turns them into undead killing machines, not very different from any other undead. In the end, only few of them are still capable of truly fulfilling their duty which means to kill only those that are not allowed to enter the guarded places. Often enough it occurred that an unsuspecting priest visited a guarded place and was killed by a Skeleton Warrior that he had helped to prepare for his eternal duty.Physically the Skeleton Warrior combines undead strength and resilience with the prowess of his former life. This and the formidable equipment make Skeleton Warriors to a significant threat to anyone unlucky enough to find one of the places that they are guarding.",

In some of them the bestial ostrich part is so strong, that they are found dead, suffocated with their heads buried into the soil. The roaming carnivostriches are supposed to lean more heavily on their wolf part. Their bestial nature means though, that they can be domesticated and trained by more sophisticated mutants and Marrows assistants. They often serve others as beasts of burden, guardian creatures or even pets. Despite their carnivorous elements, the Carnovostrich can rely solely on seeds and herbs for indefinite periods of time, when needed. On Ingol the local carnivostriches are put on a strict plant based diet and the exposure to raw meat often send them into a frenzy. By far most of the eggs that carnoviostriches lay are infertile and those are sorted out and used to sustain other mutants, that don't rely on plant fibres.In some decadent circles of society, the carnivostrich eggs are highly valued as a delicacy, which lead to the 'forgery' of carnivostrich eggs, by the sale of more readily available hydra eggs to unsuspecting and inexperienced connoisseurs. Some clues hint at the carnivostriches as just a steppingstone in Dr. Marrows experiments, to create a way more formidable and dangerous mount for his own use.",

Nowadays, however, Gladiator fights are brutal and bloody battles which mostly end deadly. Only a few arenas have specialised in harmless fights which end after the first blood was spilled. Several cities have banned arena fights as they are too dangerous.When the games in Yalahar had become more and more cruel in order to distract the masses from other problems, more and more Gladiators were replaced with criminals and mercenaries of various races. At some point, the Gladiators rebelled and tried to take over the city. Even though the revolt failed in the end, the arena quarter was lost to the revolting forces. The Gladiators could not maintain some sort of leadership, though, and their community quickly splintered into several subgroups. Today, the Yalaharian Gladiators are often descendants of these rebels. The title Gladiator became rather a name than a profession. Also the new generations of Gladiators are trained like their forefathers. They take part in brutal arena fights in which opposing families want to prove their superiority over each other.Most Gladiators who are encountered in more uncivilised areas are quite likely to attack just to make a point. Gladiators are foes with deadly skills and much battle experience that often gives them an advantage in a fight. Gladiators hardly care if they attack weaker or stronger opponents. They consider both as good possibilities to train their skills.",

Against their long-ranged weapons, the slow buffaloes were defenceless. Hundreds of buffaloes were slaughtered notably during the construction of Venore. The vast buffalo population dwindled almost to the point of extinction, leaving only small packs. But what happened then is subject to speculation. The irrefutable facts are that from one day to the next, the remaining buffaloes simply had gone, vanished without a trace. Where just the day before buffaloes had been grazing, their footprints were found to end suddenly, as if they had disappeared into thin air. While this report was dismissed and the buffaloes simply thought extinct, all of a sudden they reappeared... in greater numbers and more healthy and aggressive than before. People began to form hunting parties to drive the aggressive animals away. But the hunt did not go too well and after a while, the buffaloes disappeared again, dissolving into rising mists, sometimes even right in front of the astonished hunters. Up to this day, there is no rational explanation for this occurrence. Again and again, the ghostly herds reappeared in numbers that belied the casualties they must have suffered during their last appearance. However, if a buffalo was killed, its body remained when the others vanished again and even if a buffalo had been befriended or tamed, it remained in the known world indefinitely. Still, there is no clue whereto the buffaloes vanish, and what happens there to them. The strange behaviour of the buffaloes has led to many superstitions and it is deemed unwise to hunt buffaloes or eat their meat lest it should anger some unknown force. Some speculate that Crunor himself guards the buffaloes and grants them refuge in a mystical realm outside of space and time, while others believe the buffaloes learned some instinctive magic which provided them a magical shelter. Others again have theories about an extra-dimensional race abducting the buffaloes for experiments. In any case, someone seen riding a buffalo is regarded as either extremely brave, or extremely foolhardy as it is still considered possible that the buffalo, along with its rider, may some day vanish forever into an unknown world.",

When the elder god of the bog told the elves of Shadowthorn to capture all rioters, these insurgents started to sow what the lord of the bog hates most - fire. During the very short time this conflict lasted, both parties were about equal in both, strength and fanatism. In the end, the elf followers won the upper hand by an eyelash. The Firestartes were imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Shadowthorn. They are heavily guarded because the elves fear the Firestarters' wrath and the havoc they will surely wreak if ever released.",

They learned to defend themselves from the greed of man. Still, the Mammoths never again became as numerous as they had been in the past. The days of the great Mammoth herds, which were roaming the icy land, are gone forever.

To be more precise, what seems to be the physical body of the Orewalker is just magma, stone and ores, held together by a spirit of heat and fire. The non-corporeal beings create the bodies by sheer force of will, which in turn serve as some kind of anchor in the physical world. If their bodies are destroyed, they are hurled back into the spirit realm from which they originate. It is hard to comment on the Orewalkers' intelligence and intentions, since they seem to be so unfamiliar with the world. Given the fact that they serve in the armies of those below, it is assumed that the Orewalker spirits are called from beyond and more or less forced into a physical body before being unleashed with some rudimentary orders. The spirits are probably highly intelligent, but given the differences between the worlds it seems impossible for any form of communication other than forcing them to do something. It is not known whether they follow those below for their own unfathomable reasons or are reluctant, perhaps even rebellious helpers. Given the treatment of other minions by those below, a form of slavery seems most likely, but an unholy alliance of sorts cannot be ruled out. Any experiments to call and bind such a spirit are futile as long as so little is known about those spirits and their world.In battle, the Orewalkers are somewhat clumsy. Only few of them seem to remain in our world long enough to get some sense of coordination. What they lack in manoeuvrability, they make up for in brutal strength of their snakelike bodies and the heat of the blood-like magma that flows within their veins.",

These creatures, that once probably just were common bears, became dangerous predators of berserk-like frenzy. The thanatursus is a carnivore that doesn't even shun away from carrion. In the contrary: it's known that the deformed bears often drag their kills into lairs, where they rot for a while before they are eaten. It seems the thanatursus does so for a more practical reason though. Observations lead to the theory that a thanatursus does absorb certain traits and even physical characteristics from their eaten prey. This seems to be more intense, the more fresh the devoured creature is. The natural instinct of the bear-creature seems to be to hide the carrion away for a later date, but if a fight with a victim drags on and drains more energy and blood then usual, the thanatursus is more likely to feast on it immediately. This probably leads to it mostly absorbing traits from more formidable foes and become more and more powerful over time. An average, grown up thanatursus combines the power and appearance of a couple of their prey. Some of them develop horns, similar to bulls or stags, most display the snout of a boar or fangs of a wolf. Some added more disturbing elements like human-like hands, elf-like faces or the wings of a giant bat. Even scales and tentacles are possible additions to their body. While the common thanatursus is an enough disturbing sight and threat, their very nature makes vastly different and more powerful variants a possibility. Sadly it's more than just a rumour that some of these creatures escaped the dream realms and began to roam the realm of Tibia. Though loners, these individuals acquired considerable power and already changed into creatures vastly different from the common thanatursus. With men as part of their common diet, they developed intelligence and ambition, preying on more and more dangerous foes to add their strengths to their own array of abilities.",

        "text": "The war in Zao required a high degree of mobility. The answer to this request was the mounted archer. However, it took some time to make this solution palatable to the savage orcs. Barely able to control their blood lust, the orcs easily forgot their intention to stay away from the enemy and steered their mounts into the fray. Those who managed to withstand such urges were often seen as cowards and were widely shunned by other orcs. Only with the coming of their new leaders such prejudices changed. The few scattered Orc Marauders were combined and received additional training. Some of the smarter orcs were picked to support the ranks of the riders and once their effectiveness was proven, the acceptance of the Orc Marauders among the orcs grew continuously.Used more efficiently, these new units of the orcish horde made the difference that was necessary to tune the tones of war at least for a while. The Orc Marauders attacked the lizard armies from afar. Slowly the casualties drained the strength of the lizard armies and the attacks of the orcs became bolder and bolder. The attacks usually started with Orc Marauders weakening the defensive lines. When the main body of the orcs attacked, the Orc Marauders switched to flanking tactics and caught scattered troops on the run. In more peaceful times, Orc Marauders serve as scouts or hunters.Only the most daring orcs are chosen as Orc Marauders. Unlike the warwolves, the gnarlhounds are not bond to a specific orc. Rather the gnarlhounds are shared by the tribe and picked randomly before a raid. Given the unpredictability of the gnarlhounds, it is of little consequence for the rider. Since gnarlhounds are prone to frenzy in battle, the Orc Marauders treat their skin with a mixture of gnarlhound excrements and herbs to avoid being ripped to shreds by their own mounts.",

This gets them often into fights with the smart but physically weak imps. Since both races feel superior over the other, they do not get along too well.Under a strict leadership the Destroyers prove quite competent in the area they are employed, which is usually to destroy things and to mash people. However, their true strength comes through quantity. Demons of higher ranks like to accumulate a horde of such minions and let them loose on a target. Such an unleashed horde of Destroyers is virtually unstoppable. Having a seemingly endless supply on Destroyers, only the difficultly to enter the realms of the mortals keeps the demons from using them on a larger scale.",

The attempts of the dwarfs to replace their digging rotworms with Vulcongras were met with little success due to the Vulcongras' untrainable nature. The Vulcongras are almost purely by its instincts. Their foremost need seems to be hunger. Vulcongras spend most of their time on finding and eating. Since they can eat almost everything from dust to stones, they are literally eating constantly without any need of sleep or water. As there seems to be no way to scare them off, Vulcongras often become a threat for gnomish holdings. As they do not seem to care what they eat, the Vulcongras shun away from nothing. They could equally destroy a gnomish house as they would devour precious tools or crystals. They stoically fight back any attackers. Even when not attacked, someone often finds himself at the centre of a Vulcongra's eating attention as it tries to sample some bites. They lack any evil intention,though. The gnomes are experimenting on driving them away with certain crystal frequencies or lights, without any notable success till now. The Vulcongra seem to be just too dumb to be affected by any scare tactic. The stupidity and hunger of the Vulcongra is so prominent that they feature in many gnomish sayings such as 'hungry as a Vulcongra'.",

So to speak born into the nobility of dragon kind, the Dragon Lord Hatchlings contain the worst traits any dragon hatchling could have. Although they are able to control their appetite in a better way than other hatchlings, they only use this self-restraint for cruel cat and mouse games they love to play with their soon-to-be food. And food can be almost everything that is or has been alive, even their own kind. Particularly, old and sick dragons, that did not leave early enough for the fabled dragon cemetery, often fall prey to their malicious offspring. As dragons are not willing to teach anything to their hatchlings, the youngsters have to become keen observers to pick up a few tricks and some magic from the older generation.",

Dwarf Miners, however, are particularly protective about their secrets. This attitude often borders on obsession and in certain cases even crosses this border. To make matters worse, most Dwarf Miners are very attached to their mines, their tools, their ore, and their stones. Taking this into account, it becomes obvious that it needs only little to provoke the wrath of a Dwarf Miner.Even though, most Dwarf Miners are happy to dig through earth and stone in some mine beneath the Big Old One, some of them seek their luck elsewhere. Many of those \"emigrants\", however, were forced to leave their home and their beloved mines. Most of them displayed an aggressive behaviour that was unacceptable even for dwarven standards. For this reason, they were sent away by their fellow miners to search for ore in other mines. Now they are living in some kind of exile away from the dwarven society. Other dwarfs that can be found in places far away from the Big Old One are renegades. Not aggressiveness but greed made them leave the dwarven society. Some of them actually stole mining secrets to use them to gain a fortune in other areas away from Kazordoon and a society who considered them as criminals due to their evil deeds.Not driven by aggressiveness but by greed and their efforts to protect their wealth by all means, they tend to attack everyone they encounter in their mines. The result, however, is the same: a mad pick axe swinging dwarf that is trying to hack the intruder into pieces. Everything that Dwarf Miners might lack in skill, they make up with their exceptional constitution and an enormous strength, often accompanied by their anger and fury.",

But the Anuma conferred the dominance over Kilmaresh to the humans, in an effort to let them take responsibility of their own. However, after the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar and the cataclysm that severed the continent, the Anuma took the reign over Kilmaresh back - for the humans' own benefit as they said.As all Anuma, sphinxes are highly intelligent and allegedly immortal, though they can die by lethal violence. Some of them love riddles, others are more interested in stories, poems or songs. Many sphinxes are benevolent, yet some are rather merciless and dangerous. All of them can be short-tempered if they feel that a human being will not accept their well-meant guidance. Sphinxes are physically powerful but possess inherent magical skills as well. They tend to test the worth of those seeking their help by asking them riddles or intricate philosophical questions. Mortals will encounter sphinxes in the vast steppe of Kilmaresh as well as in the ruins of ancient sites where they guard the treasures and secrets of the lost empire.",

While each minotaurs is taught the basic principles of the mooh'tah only a few chosen are able to follow its teachings truly. They basic principles are meant to help the minotaurs to ease their inner rage, which is considered as unclean and offensive. The ultimate goal is to not only master the inner anger but dissolve it into spiritual energy. The ultimate idea is instead of dedicating energy to fight the anger, in the end the anger becomes additional energy and therefore supply of enormous power. Since the true path of mooh'tah requires not only dedication but also time and resources, it's usually the nobility that can afford to indulge the studies. While the first lessons are basic and primary consists of philosophic teachings, soon also the body is honed. Beginning with breathing techniques and continuing with the correct way to move, the training becomes over the years more and more martial. As the first lessons teach the spirit and the body to become one, the higher teachings concern the flow of magic and making a weapon a part of their body. The great goal is the unity with the world. This goal is never truly accomplished though and only a few mooh'tah masters are even attempting the impossible and instead concentrate more on their martial progress. This self centred usage of the mooh'tah is considered sinful and false by a few purists. Those usually live as hermits away from minotaur society that they see as rotten and misguided. Still they are often sought out by students that ask for guidance but more often then not those are brusquely turned away. Though their disapproval of minotaur society is well known the hermits are held in high regard by the populace. The more worldly mooh'tah masters are usually part of the local military hierarchy and sometimes form highly valued elite squads within an army. Extremely efficient and unyielding fighters they serve as inspiration for the common troops and sometimes one mooh'tah master alone is enough to turn the tides of battle. Skilled in the art of war and in possession of secret magic they are the epitome of all that a minotaur could want to be. Towards non minotaurs that are obviously not even aware of the principle of mooh'tah they usually only feel disgust, but it would be of course beneath a true master to show that.",

One of the most invasive species encountered is the chasm spawn. The rate with that the chasm spawn reproduces seem to hit at a highly lethal habitat in that the spawn usually breeds. Due to the low likelihood of survival the chasm spawn produces numerous offspring. Now in the upper areas of the world this reproduction creates an overpopulation of spawns in the areas that they inhabit. As their name suggests they lay their slimy eggs into cracks, caves and chasms. Their anatomy allows them to crawl an walls and ceilings and reach even the most remote of cracks. In a relatively short time their finger sized offspring hatches and begins to devour its siblings. Still great numbers of then survive and inhabit their birth caves where they prey on lesser vermin. While growing up they seem to be fair game for other races that inhabit the tunnels and even other minions that serve those bellow. Even with this constant culling, their numbers are growing at an alarming rate. Even the chasm spawns seem uncomfortable with this, since reportedly there is an unheard amount of infighting amongst them and even acts of cannibalism. Still they are one of the more intelligent minion races of those below, showing acts of cunning and deviousness that hints at a planning mind. They use especially their wall crawling ability to set up traps and are capable of coordinated attacks and retreats. Even more disturbing is the rumour that minions of other races also show a more coordinated acting when they are around, but this observations were made in high pitched battles when perception can be deceiving and all those claims might be without any substance. This is similar to the claims that the chasm spawn is only younger phase of a larger, fiercer creature and that one of the leading generals of those below, the creature known as Abyssador is the final form of this process of evolvement.",

        "text": "The glooth blob is the result of careless experiments with glooth and lesser critters like rats, insects and birds. Whatever the original purpose of the experiments may have been, the outcome was a slimy mass of semi sentient glooth. To make matters worse the products of the experiments were deemed a failure and discarded. That way several test subjects escaped and multiplied by splitting themselves after they gained a certain amount of size. The experiments were stopped and the magistrate ordered the files about them to be securely hidden and classified highly confidential. It seems in the beginning there were several strains that could be considered glooth blobs but eventually only one discernible strain seems to have survived. The blobs are often drawn to glooth sources though they seemingly not actively absorb it. Only in times before they split they actively consume glooth and glooth residue in great masses so it is assumed glooth is necessary for their reproduction. It is speculated though, that the glooth could possibly be substituted by something else but the magistrate put an end to further investigations in that matter. Though the glooth blob is not actively aggressive it its highly territorial and instinctively attacks any intruders. What is an intruder and what not seems quite random though, as glooth blobs are known to sometimes coexist relatively peaceful with other creatures. Glooth blobs are often drawn to sources of carrion and organic waste and therefore the Rathleton magistrate ordered a strict policy towards waste disposal to minimize the intrusions of blobs into the city. Of course ignorance and recklessness undermine this efforts and so a number of blobs is attracted by especially the poorer quarters of the city. Occasionally for completely unknown reasons great numbers of glooth blobs are spawned. There is no known common factor in this occurrences and usually they vanish as sudden as they appear, some are reportedly dissolving into pools and rapidly dehydrate into dust. In this times the blobs are unusually aggressive and dangerous as they actively hunt for prey. Blobs that have consumed a certain mass of matter and swollen far beyond their usual size have been observed, slithering towards a common point. No one has yet made out this point and there is not even a valid theory for what reason the glooth blobs behave that way. The magistrate has forbidden all further investigation because to the danger associated with it.",

Though they can take different shapes they favour a seductive appearance, for example in the form of young dancers. These demonesses are driven mainly by greed and envy. They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. There are several kinds of asuri. The dawnfire asuri have tanned skin and black hair, favouring clothes in the colours red, orange and yellow. They are associated with fire and energy and prefer to use magic rather than weapons.",

For this reason, they are not trusted and, despite their intelligence, rarely appointed to any position of power or influence. The scheming little Diabolic Imps still found their niche in the demon society. They often serve in logistics or as messengers.

For hours they can wait motionlessly for the unwary to approach and then to strike at complete surprise. If they manage to catch some mammal in water, there is almost no escape.

There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. The rearguard of the winter court have fallen far from what they once were. The first encounter of them probably took place not in their own realm but on Tibia. Just recently some older reports about an attack on a caravan could be connected to them. In the reports of the few survivors the caravan in question was attacked by a roaming orcish tribe. When all seemed lost, the orcs where attacked by what they would later call elf-like 'bow-furies'. At first the traders and their mercenaries were happy about their unsuspected rescue until they recognized their 'saviors' made no difference between men or orc, shooting and hacking their bloody path through them. At least the ferocious attack gave some of them the opportunity to escape with their bare lives at least. When the survivors later returned to the battle-site with reinforcements they found everyone slaughtered, not even the horses and pack-animals were spared but nothing of the goods were plundered at all.",

Terrorsleeps avoid the sunlight as it stuns and disorientates them. They do not see as we do, but sense other creatures' body warmth and fear. Hungry, toothed mouths protrude on their head instead of eyes. Using their mouths like augers, they bite open their victims and bathe in their bloody carcass like birds in a water pool. Terrorsleeps have very light and flexible bones and can squeeze through anywhere. They particularly like to slither and slime through dark, dank places, searching and sniffing out anything warm, alive; feeding on its fear, coveting its warmth, sucking out its life force. Their whitish belly is swollen with terror juices that foam up as gooey, frothy saliva hanging in threads and webs from their bared teeth. Touching it instils horrible paranoia and paralyses the victim so that the terrorsleep can devour it. Their putrid, blood-soaked wings they use to stabilise themselves and to swim or soar through darkness to reach ever deeper, isolated places. Once you are in darkness, you are never safe from a terrorsleep.There are surmises that the original beasts might have once been intended as riding animals or messengers, but were corrupted by horrific experiments or the negative energies of Roshamuul. In their company, the terrorsleep only tolerate creatures similar to themselves: the feversleeps who are burning hot and sweaty to the touch and who love cool water, are perhaps the offspring of the terrorsleep or a sibling creature from a nightmare having taken shape. The shy shiversleeps however are the rarest of the terrorsleep family; they like shallow, warm water and are very territorial, disappearing like mist through suddenly opening vortices into the protective darkness, and very little is known about them at all.",

        "text": "Even the lowest members of the lizard army had to complete a rigorous training. Once the vast armies of the lizard people ruled the land of Zao with an iron fist. They had freed the lands from long forgotten competitors and efficiently eradicated each major threat for the empire. Each new menace was faced by the well-trained army led by elite generals. Even when the lizard people ruled unchallenged for centuries, their legions were not allowed to disregard their training. Bound to ancient traditions, their training continued under the rules set by the founders of the empire. The training has lost little of its harshness in the course of centuries.A Lizard Legionnaire is only responsible to army members of higher ranks. A position in the legion is one of prestige, and even though they are still at the mercy of their superiors, it is a step to relative freedom because a place in the army saves the Lizard Legionnaire from the influence of the many bureaucrats of the empire.For a long period in the lizard people's history, the legions were only useful for parades and guardian duties. Still, when the great plague and the rise of the lizard people's enemies threatened the empire, the legions stood ready but saw themselves heavily outnumbered. During hasty recruitments, auxiliary troops were raised from the remaining population. But even fitted out with the best equipment, those untrained troops perished by dozens. Only the restocking of the legion ranks proved effective. With the stabilisation of the empire by the might of the dragons, the legions finally got the vitally needed time to refill their ranks and slowly managed to hold the status quo on their own. Still, the empire lacks Lizard Legionnaires to regain lost territory and looks for other means to strengthen its power.",

Unlike the male raiders, who either are quite gifted in magic or lack this talent completely, some women show some kind of inherent magic. Their talent is not strong enough to call the more powerful spirits, but they have a special knack to handle animals and to heal wounds which can only be explained with magic. With some training they are able to conjure some animal spirits and lead them into battle. Even though their magical abilities are quite limited, they can also use their powers in several destructive ways to defend themselves. Under the shaman queen, it has become more and more common that only shamans utterly loyal to her receive a formal and extensive training. For this reason the ranks of the Barbarian Brutetamers have been boosted with some truly gifted women who will probably never be able to use the full power of their potential. Still the Barbarian Brutetamers are absolutely loyal to their clans and tribes and they will use everything at their disposal to strike down the enemies of their cold-hearted queen.",

It took several weeks to defeat an already severely injured Sparkion.Even though they seem to be closest to mindless automatons, they often show very specific individual patterns of behaviour which they do not share with other Sparkions. Some even argue that Sparkions do not exist at all, but only a group of very similar, yet different forms of unlife. On the other hand, most Sparkions show at least some common characteristics, such as strength or the tenacity with which goals are being pursued.While many of the new creatures often act irrationally, the Sparkion rarely stops before it has finished what it started. Then again it must be said that the goal of a Sparkion can be anything, e.g. the extinction of all life in a certain area - and this does not necessarily look purposefully for an outsider.It is one of the most disturbing characteristics of the Sparkion to destroy and devastate everything around it, leaving a formless mass of matter which resembles the realm of the Sparkion's origin. Warnings are voiced that the vortexes need to be stopped; otherwise, swarms of Sparkions will eventually stream out of them to prepare our world for an ending at which everything we know is going to be sucked into the void and devoured. So far, however, the Sparkions seem to be only one of many forces from beyond. Also, no massive amassment has been witnessed yet, and it is totally inconceivable that a guiding force with a conscious plan exists.However, it is quite alarming that Sparkions are often seen carrying loads of material, such as stones, tree stumps and even corpses into the vortexes. Yet, several expeditions into the vortexes could not figure out what has happened to aforementioned materials on the other side of the vortexes. The most likely theory is that the materials are used to stabilize or even grow the realm beyond. This, however, would suggest that something greater and more powerful is guiding the mindless Sparkions' actions after all.",

It is rumoured that the candidates do not only face several creatures in the arena but also have to battle their inner demons to prove themselves worthy. With the decline of the empire and the dwindling numbers of lizards, these tests became less and less lethal. Still, failure is seen as a dire disgrace and once these unlucky individuals are back in the legions they often seek death in battle to escape their shame.The Lizard High Guards are the elite troops of the empire and fiercely loyal to their superiors following their strict code of honour. Their pride and honour let them stick to any given task, regardless how futile their mission may seem. Failure is no option for a Lizard High Guard. In the army, the Lizard High Guards form an almost monastic order with rituals and an ever present code of behaviour. The ideal Lizard High Guard is expected to be an example of absolute control over its mind and body. Lizard High Guards on ceremonial watch are known to remain so motionless that they could easily pass as statues.

Provided with a bit more intelligence than the other chakoyas, they are mainly responsible for handcraft in the tribes. It is them who provide the tribes with all kinds of different weapons and who are able to handle the more complicated distance weapons in fights.Since supplies are hard to gather in the northern waste, Chakoya Toolshapers often accompany the tribewardens on their hunts for food and resources. In battles they function as leaders, at least until the frenzy takes over. As running away is no option for a chakoya that does not want to end as dinner for its clanmates, Chakoya Toolshapers, unlike other distance fighters, charge an enemy with little regard of their own safety.",

        "text": "Lowlifes, bandits and cutthroats make up the bulk of the followers of the fallen knights and robber barons. With little regard for law and honour, these scrupulous beings follow profit, power and promises. Usually already on the run from some local law, they seek out the protection that the villainous knights offer them. They are the disposable muscle and arrow fodder their masters rely on for their crimes. They are equipped with the left-over scraps that their superiors don't mind about, and are easy prey for the whimsical justice of their dark lords. Still, they look down on the ordinary bandit and tend to justify their miserable existence by boasting of the accomplishments of their leaders, taking a perverted sort of pride in their services, and especially in the exploits of their leaders. This pride means nothing as soon as it is seriously tested, though. The so-called 'vicious squires' tend to flee from battle if there's not an immediate victory at hand; and should one of their superiors shows any sign of weakness, it is surely exploited in one way or another. Regardless of their similar behaviour to bandits, it has to be acknowledged that they are indeed better equipped, fed and prepared for battle than their ordinary brethren in spirit. To be accepted as a squire and survive more than a few weeks requires some battle prowess and cunning which only veteran bandits posses. Usually, a wandering robber knight assimilates the local bandit gangs in his troops. On rare occasions, a knight and his followers take over some remote settlement for a while and empty the prison to acquire new recruits. After a short time, only the suitable candidates are left over. These are more or less formally accepted as new squires and are under nominal protection and legislation of the knights. All in all, though, they are left to fend on their own as long as they follow orders. Usually, where the squires are encountered, their masters are not far away; but sometimes they are sent on long-range reconnaissance or have been abandoned by their leaders for some reason. After losing their leaders, they usually disperse quickly, mostly looking for another knight to follow, some founding their own bandit gangs, reverting to old customs. Sadly, it is not unheard of that roaming squires are allowed into official armies or city guards for their experience and training. For most of them, though, there are only a few options left open at the end of their dubious career. Most end their lives as squires in one of their masters' raids. A significant number falls prey to internal struggles for power and loot. A few gather some renown and are finally 'knighted' by their leader. It is not known that any of them have ever accumulated enough money to retire peacefully - then again, probably no one would boast of such a criminal past.",

The skin colour changes as the creatures mature, with juveniles being blue and adult animals being bright red. Goannas lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but sometimes also inside termite mounds, which offers protection as well as incubation. Additionally, the termites provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Goanna eggs are a sought after meal for the human population of Kilmaresh. But as getting them is a dangerous task, they make a rather expensive menu. Goannas are found throughout the steppes of Kilmaresh. They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth.",

They are probably the least dangerous of the Hive Born and are quite territorial. Ladybugs live only for about a week and decay quite fast into a mass that can be easily devoured by other hive creatures or absorbed by the hive. Sometimes they sacrifice themselves and die seemingly on purpose to heal wounded hive structures. Astonishingly enough, unlike other hive creatures, Ladybugs show no great difference in their behaviour when separated from the hive for an extended period of time. While other creatures become increasingly aggressive and eventually mutilate themselves or simply wither and die, the Ladybugs show no such behaviour. Quite the contrary, Ladybugs separated from the hive are reported to live considerably longer and behave more like the common giant bugs. That lets scientists believe that Ladybugs may not be hive creatures per se but a creature that lives in some kind of symbiosis with the hive. Only occasionally, Ladybugs take part in the war against the Deeplings, mainly when the hive needs to be defended.",

These Boars are more than capable to defend themselves and now, they are not only retaking their former habitats.Usually found in the deep woods far away from civilisation, their boldness and insatiable hunger drives them more and more to human settlements which mean easy food for them. Their foraging often leaves fields and farms devastated, however, an ordinary farmer knows better than to try fighting the fearsome beasts that usually form small flocks and are rarely encountered alone.

Their fame as town destroyers only arose from their strength which allows them to be much more successful than its smaller version.It is unknown why earth elementals rise in different sizes.

Sometimes the trained Draptors are used to boost the ranks of the lizard armies. Since a Draptor is prone to fits of berserk rage, this is not a strategy which should be applied lightly. When the Draptor can be kept in line though, it is a powerful addition to the troops. With shredding claws and dreadful jaws, they tear and bite through the ranks of their enemies.Since the Draptors lay eggs but do not breed them, they seek out hidden spots to place their clutches. Again and again such hidden eggs are found by travelling adventurers who take them with them as food or out of curiosity without knowing what they have found there. That way the eggs of the Draptors sometimes travel to foreign lands. It is only a question of time until this aggressive predator will conquer new areas where it will assert its instinctive behaviour and cause great damage.",

Rather a coward, the Gnarlhound forgets quite fast about its fear when it gets angry, and it takes only little to anger one of those beasts. Their aggressiveness often offsets their cowardice and suppresses the impulse to flee. Instead they transfer it into wild and vicious behaviour which often looks quite similar to canine madness.The Gnarlhound was one of the mammals that the lizard people raised as livestock to meet the ever-growing need of food. This led almost to the extinction of the wild population of Gnarlhounds. After the collapse of the southern areas, the Gnarlhounds turned feral once again. Missing any major competition in the food chain, the Gnarlhound population grew as quickly as that of the orcs. Sharing the same habitat, both races clashed quite often. In the end, most Gnarlhounds accepted their place in the pecking order beneath the orcs. Ever since, they seem to have some agreement from which post sides benefit. The Gnarlhounds serve the orcs as hunting animals, beasts of burden, mounts, and occasionally food source. The orcs share some of their prey and give the Gnarlhounds shelter and protection. Still, it is an alliance out of necessity, and the still feral Gnarlhounds are known to attack their supposed masters sometimes - not that someone in the brutal orc society would bother about such an issue.Misjudging the seeming 'pet status' of the Gnarlhounds, some orcs took Gnarlhound puppies on their journeys and found out about their feral and aggressive nature not until later. Some Gnarlhounds were then set free or escaped, and it must be feared that Gnarlhound populations also develop at some remote places and lands.",

The reflective skin of the Mercurial Menace does not only provide an ample physical protection, but it also shrouds the fast moving flyer with a shroud of irritating light reflections that can confuse opponents and let many attacks only hit thin air. Yet this additional protection comes with added weight that makes airborne manoeuvres vastly more difficult and the Mercurial Menace quickly becomes hard pressed to maintain greater heights even if needed. There seems to be a yet to be discovered island at some remote spot in the gnomerean seas, where they return to breed and raise their young. This somewhat seem to restrict them to certain areas of Gnomprona and stop them from spreading too far. As the Mercurial Menaces seems to spend only little time there at all such a place is probably some inhospitable yet safe piece of rock. Their seemingly erratic movement and attack patterns add to the confusion, which is one of the most dangerous tools of this flying predator. It moves swiftly, attacks, retreats a little only to attack again in the next moment. Added with the slightly blinding effects of their skin, the Mercurial Menace seems to shift places within a blink. Their constant chirping that rather reminds one of crickets than any bird, mammal or lizard, adds to the confusion that they spread. Another sound they employ is closely resembling those of the local shrieking crystals, which might be some form of acoustic mimicry that adds to their tools of distraction and confusion. It's of note that this chirping or acoustic mimicry only starts when the Mercurial Menace is already attacking and it can approach its target with almost any noise, trying to attack by surprise. Despite being skilled, though not enduring flyers they tend to roam close to the grounds and rather fly through thickets then to fly over it. That might be to avoid the arial superiority of the numerous nighthunters that roam the upper layers of gnompronean airspace.",

However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a religious war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This was interpreted as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was rumoured that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and the worship of Fafnar is now forbidden in the new empire.But the cult of Fafnar still exists on Kilmaresh, albeit in secret. Her followers go to great lengths to strengthen Fafnar's influence and try to re-establish her worship. To achieve their goals they are not above using either infiltration or violence. The Priestesses of the Wild Sun are a special branch of Fafnar's clerics. They serve the Smiter with great devotion but other than the Burning Gladiators they seek to restore Fafnar's worship by intrigues and scheming rather than brute force.",

Most members of their trade die soon by traps, ancient guardians of the tombs or blades of adventurers. Only those cunning and tough enough to survive those perils become the dreaded and despised crypt defilers. They have gathered a meagre fortune to be able to afford better armor and weaponry and some of them even learned to turn the parts of buried creatures into toxins. They are responsible for leading bands of grave robbers out of their customary regions and finance expeditions to seek fortune in far lands. It is due to their dubious courtesy that parties of grave robbers can be encountered almost everywhere in the known world. They and their henchmen are often drawn to a newly discovered crypt like flies to a cadaver. Though some of the crypt defilers are in the employment of eccentric collectors or dealers of stolen goods, most of them are just unscrupulous thieves. Some of them have learned that strength comes in numbers and band together for a common goal, often employing a bunch of less experienced grave robbers. Such alliances usually don't last for long though, as these individuals are prone to betray or sacrifice each other in the face of even the slightest danger. Still it is not unheard of that some of these gangs last long enough to acquire a name for themselves, others have some form of 'representative' in the more dubious parts of the larger cities that can help in the acquiring of 'long lost objects' - for a price of course.",

Although their power is only a fraction of the power that once ruled the murky depths of the ocean, it is still enough to be more than a match for the unsuspecting adventurer. The only chance of a more balanced fight is to challenge them ashore where they are somewhat weaker than in their maritime habitat.

Blood priests devote their lives to the study of blood and so-called lesser fluids. They attribute the most stupefying qualities to blood, and experiment extensively with it, using strange devices in their blood hall caverns. This requires a constant supply of fresh fluids and bodies and therefore blood priests and their henchmen are avoided even by their fellow Dark Summoners for fear of their lives. Even their names reflect their love for everything associated with blood and it is said they do not exactly dye their robes blood red. Blood Priests love extravaganza in speech and habit, but they also favour symmetrical shapes and figures - nets, crosses, or abstract tree shapes - shapes that favour a flow and distribution of fluids. Their single-minded extravaganza extends to their love for other species as well. Though rats are usually preferred animals of Urgith and abound in Drefia, blood priests dote on bats, ticks and leeches, and it is even rumoured they have some kind of agreement with the vampires - though nobody dares to imagine to what purpose, and certainly will not ask.",

For many years, hordes of Sea Serpents made the ship passage between Carlin and Svargrond impassable. Then, almost over night, they vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. Still, sightings of Sea Serpents are not uncommon nowadays. Sea Serpents are omnivores but prefer meat over seaweed and tang. They hunt seals, sharks, octopuses and small whales, and occasionally also quara. The quara are in a strange relationship with the Sea Serpents. Some of them worship single Sea Serpents like gods, while others organise large hunting parties to exterminate Sea Serpents that enter their territory.Normally, Sea Serpents are afraid of the strange ships humans tend to travel with. Some of them, however, seem to have overcome their fear. Those Sea Serpents attack ships with all their strength, and they are able to destroy even the biggest ships that cruise the seas. If they are able to wreck a whole ship, one can imagine what a single diver or swimmer has to expect from these beasts. While most Sea Serpents avoid the noisy big ships, a single human is always a welcome snack. Sea Serpents attack immediately, and only the fact that they are not used to meet with resistance might be an advantage of their victims.",

While other demons are known for their sheer strength and destructive power, Hellflayers are more dreaded and revered for their malicious cunning. Usually, they prefer to stay in the demon strongholds and spend their time plotting and scheming, although they seem to be involved with the spreading of certain spells which allow mortals to call them into their world. If they are summoned, it is usually a specific Hellflayer that can be called, and instead of being used as a help in battle, they are more prized as advisors and teachers of the dark arts. The reason for their eagerness to be summoned might be related to the fact that they often offer blood pacts to their summoners, and serve as emissaries of darker powers. Their offers are forbidden knowledge about artefacts, skills and spells, and their demands vary from seemingly harmless and easy deeds in their service to claiming parts of the summoner's soul. Hellflayers often keep close contact to their summoners and lure them deeper and deeper into their dark web. This is commonly known among summoners, but the appeal of the power and knowledge the Hellflayers offer has been hard to resist for many a curious mind. And while only the most foolish believe themselves to be the master of their summoned creature, in the end many fall victim to the hidden snares the Hellflayers add to their deals and pacts.Hellflayers aren't free from vanity of their own, though. They tend to see themselves as somewhat of the demonic aristocracy, courting the various demon lords and princes with their services. Though generally more interested in corrupting and enthralling mortals, their arsenal of spells makes them a formidable opponent if they are forced to fight. Especially the places they call home are fiercely protected. But even then, they prefer to rely on other demons to take the beating, and readily sacrifice them for their own survival.",

Insane to a degree that resembles rabies, they are all teeth and claws when attacking an enemy. Their masters often bind their weapons to their hands, since the lost beserkers tend to forget to use them in the heat of battle and often try to overpower their foes through clawing and biting. Gnomish troops that took enemy bases by surprise told stories that the lost beserkers are held in what resembles high security prisons chained in iron, deprived from sound and vision by leathery masks. More than other Lost they are focused on battle and carnage. Even other Lost, accustomed to injuries, wars and infighting tend to avoid them. Sometimes their bloodlust is so great that they begin to fight each other even in the midst of battle.",

        "text": "The Noxious Ripptor is a prime example for the gnompronean fauna. A primal beast and probably the ancestor of at least one surface creature and its subspecies. It's a feral predator whose aggressiveness supersedes that of all of its descendants. The Ripptors are known to attack everything that moves, even if just fed or even feeding. They seem to forget anything else as soon as a new target for their aggression shows up. This aggressive behaviour is seemingly randomly extended to members of their own species from time to time. Sudden attacks and fight between two or more Noxious Ripptors are quite common and differently to other such occurrences in the animal kingdom, might lead to the death or dismembering of the fighting creatures. In battle they show little regard to their own safety and no Noxious Ripptor will ever retreat from a fight once it begun. Only another distraction may draw a Ripptor from its current prey. The noxious part of their name comes from their disgusting ability to vomit balls of toxic residue that they can seemingly produce in abundance. They use it to shower their victims from afar while closing in as they obviously just want to ultimately rip and tear whatever they might attack.Curiously enough they seem to be drawn to the sound admitted by the so called Shrieking Cry-stals though it seemingly puts them into a kind of milder form of their common frenzy. So it's not uncommon for them to follow said creatures and the latter, also prone to aggressive attacks of their own, seem not to mind at all. Gnomish attempts to in turn influence Ripptors with their own resonating crystals lead to no reaction of the Ripptors at all. Further experiments revealed that the Ripptors are almost deaf and completely rely on sense like smell and sight for orientation. The next logical step, to widen the research on crystal vibrations have yet not lead to anything fruitful.",

        "text": "Another phenomenon attributed to the infamous necromantic smog of Rathleton is the existence of the blood beast. As hideous and disgusting as these creatures are, the secret of their creation is even more disturbing. It seems sometimes decaying corpses of animals become that imbued with the unstable necromantic residue, that their carrion blood becomes the carrier of some dark force when it somehow reacts with glooth. This blood behaves almost as sentient. It is known to creep around and even hide itself. It's searching for more blood, changed like itself and through metaphysical means is obviously able to sense it. Over time more and more of this mix of blood and glooth finds together, building sometimes enormous pools in underground caverns. Those pools act like a beacon for the spirits of predatory animals that died in pain and anger. If such a creature comes close to the pool a part of it splits and devours the spirit, becoming a separate entity on its own. The so created creature knows only the basest and cruellest instincts of the beasts. With a malleable body of soiled glooth and unclean blood it follows the needs of a predator. The blood beast lurks or hunts like ordinary animals would do, but it reveals a cunning beyond that of animals and a cruelty that is frightening. It is unknown if the creature actually needs food or at least has to replenish blood by its kills. The blood beast was immortalised by Hainnbert Shuckletons novel 'The beast from the shadows' which spread knowledge of these creatures throughout the world and painted a mostly false and overly romantic and tragic picture of the cruel predator. Rumours attribute the blood beast all kinds of unverified abilities like flowing beneath doors or through wall cracks or wall crawling and even lurking on ceilings. Most of this misleading information is spread by novels that tried to copy Shuckletons success and lead to the demise of more than one know-it-all adventurer. To complicate things even furthers there actually IS evidence to support some of the wilder claims made about the abilities of the creature. For instance it is extremely probable that the blood beast can reform itself after being slain. If it is via sentient blood creeping all their way to its spawning pool to be reborn or somehow else, there is proof that victorious blood beast slayers was attacked at his home, often in sleep by a blood beast that showed disturbing knowledge of its victims combat tactics. The gravest danger though is to dismiss the existence of these creatures as purely fiction and be utterly unprepared to encounter one.",

In the following centuries wars, misfortunes and the independent spirit of the Cats led to several escapes of this furry pet.

On their torsos they like to wear beautiful silken clothes or ornate armour as well jewelry like rings, bracelets and bangles on their arms. The lower snake body is usually free of clothing, but will be protected with armour if necessary. Nagas are resistant to poison and have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic. Much like most snake and reptile species, they dislike cold climates.Nagas are an old, powerful and proud race who live on the jungle island Marapur since several millennia and built up a remarkable culture there. Their cities are said to be filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures. Their power makes them potentially dangerous to humans. However, many of them act rather benevolent towards the two-legs, as they call the humanoid races. If they are hostile and aggressive, there is always a good reason, be it obvious or not.",

Actually, they are part of the usually unseen membrane that separates different states of existence such as dimensions, spheres and worlds. Sometimes, while something is passing from one state of existence to another, parts of the membrane are spilled into one of the worlds involved. Even if it is hard to believe, this residue seems to own some sort of intelligence or at least some instinct. However, it is also possible that a Mercury Blob has an incredibly high intellect which has a concept that we simply cannot grasp.Though the residue interacts with objects and people in our world, there seems no true purpose in its actions. Whenever it meets a human being it seems to start an attack; however, no malice can be attributed to this behaviour. It is doubtful whether the residue is aware of the harm it causes or the concept of harm at all. Maybe the attacks are a form of communication attempts. Sadly, these attempts are often lethal for mortals, and so it is strongly advised to fight back with all means.Its ability to produce a copy of itself might be another attempt to interact with our world. As far as we can tell, killing a Mercury Blob results in cutting its connection to our world and letting it return into the membrane, its natural habitat.",

        "text": "What an embarrassing defeat to be ambushed and beaten by a Slug. However, this scenario has become a shocking truth. Several forms of Slugs have been raised like cattle by various races such as the orcs and goblins since the dawn of time. It is questionable whether some of the prehistoric Slug rancher came up with the idea to breed some kind of battle Slugs or if some free roaming Slugs adapted to the constant danger by other races. It is quite likely that both effects went hand in hand. Anyhow, the Slug as we know it today was the result of this process. The Slug might not be a fearsome fighter but it has adapted to the constant threat to their race by developing resilience and an acid spitting capability that at least keeps their hunters somewhat at bay. Nevertheless, Slugs are still the favourite diet of several races and especially orcs consider Slug acid a spice.Most other giant Slug races are only known from orc and goblin myths since today's Slug successfully took over most habitats including even some from other races. This led to the incident known as the great Slug plague. In a rare and (unintentionally) combined effort of humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs, goblins and others, the Slugs were hunted, their eggs were destroyed where discovered, and poisoned traps were placed in their habitats. What most races, like the humans, conveniently left out in their history books is still known today among the goblin race as the 'Great Slug Wars'. The Slugs finally (and fittingly slowly) came back after the great purge, decimated, beaten, but not defeated. Slowly, the Slugs recovered and started to show up at unexpected places. Still, any greater Slug population often provokes attacks from Slug hunters. Also, still many races consider Slugs, their acid and their eggs a delicacy. For these reasons, greater populations have become uncommon.",

Although they often take on a seductive appearance, they show their true form as soon as there is no need for charade. In this case they appear as tall, beautiful women with four arms, fangs and glowing eyes. These demonesses are driven mainly by greed and envy. They enter the mortal world because they begrudge humans and other peoples their vigour, beauty and happiness. They seek to destroy positive feelings as love, contentment and mirth, because herefrom they gain their energy. An asura especially stalks men she regards as handsome and happy. These victims are lured into gorgeous palaces full of riches and conveniences, inhabited by several asuri. There they ensnare the men with amusements such as wine, music, dance and intoxicating substances that indulge their senses and make them submissive and weak-willed. Then the asuri divest them of vitality and beauty. When an asura gets weary of her victim or if captives unexpectedly oppose the demonesses, these unfortunates come to know the true face of the palace: As the asuri show a beautiful face outwardly and are in truth terrible demons, likewise the palace, behind its marvelous veneer, is full of prison cells, torture chambers and even rooms where sacrificial altars await the asuri's emaciated victims. There are several kinds of asuri. The midnight asuri have pale skin and moon-white hair, favouring clothes in the colours black and violet. They are associated with darkness and death and are capable melee fighters.",

Several gnomish reports suggest that this strain of diremaws was created on purpose, as veritable farms of varnished diremaws were encountered by gnomish strike forces. Though there's no denying, that this breed is more formidable then their predecessor, it raises the question why Those Below with all the creatures at their disposal feel a need to specifically breed and groom this creature. It's also unknown who might be the mastermind behind such breeding, as most actions of Those Below are driven by a seemingly alien logic, the breeding of sub species seems an almost mundane trait to associate them with. Some theories suggest that the varnished diremaws have some hidden properties that are yet unknown. Some suggest they are possibly more easy to control or serve as the ideal nourishment of some bigger, meaner creature but such theories are highly speculative at best. Others point out that the taste of warm red blood drives them into a frenzy, but this seems a weak argument to justify such efforts. The assumption that the varnished diremaws can track every prey once they tasted its blood are based on no valid observations as there is no evidence that any diremaw was ever used in that way. Even if that would be the case such a trait wouldn't warrant the aforementioned efforts and number of bred tarnished diremaws. The only obvious fact is, that they are mixed into more and more hordes and bolster their ranks by significant numbers. There are no reported cases of packs that only consist tarnished diremaws. This might be a coincidence or another clue for a sinister, yet unknown purpose to those creatures.In the hordes they seem to be one of the troops that are more easy to control and guide, though this means little, considering the sheer viciousness of the creatures the hordes consist of.While the tarnished diremaws are a foe only encountered more recently, their spread in the ranks of Those Below is increasing steadily and significantly.",

If they do not have somebody controlling them, they tend to follow primal instincts such as eating and hunting. The undead state makes Zombies resilient and quite strong. However, their process of decomposing never stops and so sooner or later, a Zombie turns into a skeleton, losing strength and resilience, but strangely enough, gaining some intelligence.\nSometimes the ingredients for zombiefication potions are set free in disadvantageous environments such as town wells through which the Zombie plague spreads like an infection. If this happens, whole towns are overrun by transformed Zombies that later haunt the surrounding area for months, or even years. For such incidents, all potential zombie masters are chased by the inquisition. In some years, the popularity to burn suspicious alchemists even outstripped the popularity of witch trials.",
