Well, I should have known better than to try for a life at sea. First I completely misjudge the nature of that 'friendly captain' who 'welcomes a fellow explorer aboard'. Then I need to share a bunk with three other smelly men! And then the shanties every night! But the rum is okay I guess. But I have a bad feeling about this undiscovered land. Not only do we crash upon this supposedly still shore, but there are wild beasts and giants that feed upon us! This spider bite just won't go away! It gets bigger and bigger and I get weaker and weaker. And everywhere we dig to store our loot, more and more bones are dug up! This is a cursed land. I will join those dead bones soon, I feel.
