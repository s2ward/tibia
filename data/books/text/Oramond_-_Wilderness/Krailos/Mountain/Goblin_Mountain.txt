(You see a mouldy book of some sort. Only one passage on a page is still readable.)

Frog God tell Sugatrap, "Go to mountain high and low, where my frogs live under stone. There stay and found city of new goblinkind!"
Sugatrap woke up when scout threw stone at his head, warning of humans. Sugatrap go and tell his dream. At first all goblins laugh but when Sugatrap hit them dead, laughter died.
