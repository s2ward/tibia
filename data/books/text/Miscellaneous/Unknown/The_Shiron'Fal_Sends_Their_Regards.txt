As our former attempts to obtain the knowledge of doctor Marrow met with little success, I expect you to succeed.
The stubbornness of the doctor and his refusal to join the Shiron'Fal is not acceptable.
Yet it's also not tolerable that the research notes are endangered by another futile attempt of theft.
That's why we recalled our other agent and sent you after all.
I take it that your more subtle approach will distract the good doctor enough to give you a chance to acquire his notes.
This is of the utmost importance to our cause and another failure will be met with little patience.
As for your own request, consider it granted if you are successful.
If you insist you may follow the vague rumours and continue Shargons efforts to unearth the blood grail.
But for now your task at hand is all that matters.
