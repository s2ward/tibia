The Crawler seems to be less specialised than its hive brethren. It has been observed that they fill in any role that is needed. They even change their given role so quickly sometimes that an observer might come to the conclusion that Crawlers could make decisions consciously. Still, this is disputed and it seems more likely that they are only extremely sensitive to the commands or needs of the hive. Be it as it may, the Crawler can be encountered in each part of the hive and on the battlefield. They fight less aggressive and more coordinated than their brethren, though, they lack somewhat the strength of the others. They are even known for their retreats in a battle, just to regroup and attack again. Crawlers are swift and seem never to get tired. Even in futile tasks, they will not give up. Their tireless persistence is one of their most notable traits. They seem to be able to exist for an incredible long time without any form of nourishment and are one of the few Hive Born that can operate a significant amount of time underwater. As allrounder, they often aid their brethren in battles and seem to be capable fighters on their own.Speed and effectiveness are the hallmarks of the Crawlers. Their true status in the hive, however, is somewhat enigmatic. Their use for the war against the Deeplings is somewhat limited. Although some of them accompany the marching armies of the hive, most of them stay back as rear guards and to expand hive structures in gained territory. However, groups of them also accompany greater armies to harass their opponents and particularly to single out weakened targets.
