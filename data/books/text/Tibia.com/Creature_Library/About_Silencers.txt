The silencers are roaming in packs and will hunt down everything which is too loud for their sensitive ears and does not belong to their kin. Of course, only if their victim is smaller or weaker. It is rumoured that they actually communicate with each other. They seem to call other silencers for help or even organise themselves in some way. However, if they are aggravated in any way, they are extremely tough and unpredictable adversaries.
