The withered leaf golems are strange entities that have somehow settled with the fact that their spirit is trapped in physical form. They have endured the trials of getting used to a physical body and gained a certain familiarity with it and the physical world. This enables them to uses their strengths to the full extent, and they have become considerably more dangerous. They usually are so accustomed to an certain environment that they become extremely territorial. Still, most of them understand only very basic concepts of our world and are inhabited by a consciousness that is extremely alien to that of a human. Most of these old golems share an inexplicable aggression towards lifeforms that are not plants. On the other hand, they seem to be able to communicate with plants in some way and are usually overly protective towards them. These factors combine to an extremely dangerous state of mind that often led to attacks on anything that enters their woods. Astonishingly enough, their attacks display not only an affinity to the element earth, but also to the element of air, as they instinctively use it to enhance their movement or more often to hinder that of their chosen foes.There are rare cases of reports that tell about good-natured withered leaf golems. Almost all those cases can be linked to leaf golems inhabited by the spirits of former druids who have become more accustomed to their changed nature. These versions of the withered leaf golems often are considerably more powerful than their spirit brethren. Malignant versions of this amalgamations also exist. They often are loners that claim entire forests as their own and act as their self-proclaimed guardian, discouraging anyone to even enter the realm of their gruesome reign.
