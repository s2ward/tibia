Orc Riders are orcish elite troops mounted on grim war wolves. Their fearsome steeds make them fast and agile while their heavy lances can deal impressive damage. Orc Rider patrols can mostly be found in the plains of Tibia where the terrain is ideal for mounted combat. It is very difficult to run away from a pack of Orc Riders once you have had the misfortune to meet them.
