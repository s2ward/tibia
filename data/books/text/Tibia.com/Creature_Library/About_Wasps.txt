Wasps are predacious insects that live in the grasslands and forests of Tibia. Using their poisonous sting they attack other animals. As they are very quick it is impossible to flee from them. If you hear their thrilling buzz, it is too late to escape. As their defence is quite weak you should try to do the first strike.
