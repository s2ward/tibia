The essence of death, plague and decay is indeed a powerful one as some demons quickly realised. They used their powers to gather this essence through their minions just like bees gather honey. Then they bound these disruptive powers into tangible shapes and added a little bit of demonic spirit. Filled with decay and a malicious will, the Blightwalkers were born. Whenever they find a way into the realms of the living, their steps are followed by death and decay. Everything fertile and healthy is considered as enemy and their dark instinct drives them to destroy and ruin everything they encounter. Even though demons often summon them as individuals to bring decay upon the ranks of their enemies, some enjoy to employ Blightwalkers as shock troops and footsoldiers of their armies.
