Mega Dragons are bred to be the new ruling class of dragonkind, a reflection of the ancient dragon Nimmersatt's grand vision and himself. These colossal and conceited creatures, adorned with three heads, are constantly engaged in fierce battles for supremacy. Their internecine struggles are exacerbated by their shared belief that they are the epitome of excellence. It doesn't help they were taught to be the best of the best as each head tends to see those words as addressed to himself only. Rarely do the heads find accord, but when they do, the Mega Dragon ascends rapidly in power. Whenever one of their kind becomes overly influential, it is prone to draw the attention of Nimmersatt. In theory such dragons should be all what Nimmersatt envisioned then to be. However, this often triggers his vanity, leading to the unfortunate fate of the influential dragons being invited to his dinner table - as lunch. Nimmersatt's casual disregard for the potential consequences of his actions may prove detrimental to his ambitions of dragon dominance, but in his eyes, Nimmersatt is always right.
