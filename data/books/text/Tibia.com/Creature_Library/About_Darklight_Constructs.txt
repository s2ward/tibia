As the decay of the fallen realm takes hold of living things, the corrupting influence of the Darklight extends its reach to unliving entities. Stones and crystals, once dormant and lifeless, become animated by the unholy fusion of darkness and light. The Darklight Constructs stand as twisted embodiments of this corrupted union, their forms bearing the scars of their transformation. Veins of pulsating, malevolent energy traverse their stony bodies, emanating an eerie glow that casts haunting shadows in their wake. These constructs, infused with an unholy sentience, wield their newfound powers with an unsettling grace, becoming relentless agents of destruction under the influence of the darklight's corruptive touch.
