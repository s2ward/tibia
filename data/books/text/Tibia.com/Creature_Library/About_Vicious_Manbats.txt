An enemy not to be underestimated, the vicious manbat is swift and deadly, with a little magic ability that make it a dreaded foe. It is assumed by some of the wise in Tibia that the manbats are degenerated vampire viscounts unable to change back, or maybe some hellish breed between vampires and bats from a dark unnamed place. In appearance a more than man-tall giant blue bat with sharp claws and teeth, the manbat is both intimidating and grotesque. It will chase its victim relentlessly, slashing and clawing at it, and sometimes calling bats to its aid in order to harass and disorient its prey. Anyone unfortunate enough to encounter a manbat should be swift-footed and well-armed.
