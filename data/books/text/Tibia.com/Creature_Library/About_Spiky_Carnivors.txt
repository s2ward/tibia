This species as the name already says exclusively feeds on raw meat. The very special way of digesting its prey leads to very unique products a hunter can obtain. The items of interest are little glass plates that arise in the so called process of glassification. They are coveted materials for craftsmanship.During their development, they go through various stages which ultimately manifest in specific habits and appearance.The adolescent carnivor has already breeded a massive protective dorsum. So its name is spiky carnivor. Adventurers should avoid direct contact with this species, otherwise they might get poisened by its spikes. It is more threatening than its younger developmental stage. So they hit harder while also having a better defence.
