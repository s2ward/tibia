Glooth Brigands, as they also call themselves, hang out at the more or less abandoned tunnels and sewers under Rathleton. As usual bandits they try to gain something of value for themselves, but they are also highly interested in new glooth-based inventions and weapons. Glooth Brigands are often in the possession of a wide variety of weapons, their armour has usually at least one glooth-based component. They set up their hideouts in secluded and often dangerous caves, tunnels and sewers. Involved in many illegal activities, they can be found in the service of all kind of persons that want some dirty work performed. Mostly though, the theft of new glooth weapons is their main purpose.
