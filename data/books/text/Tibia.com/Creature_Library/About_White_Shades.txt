White shades are ghostly apparitions stalking the sunken graveyards of Drefia. Haunted by painful memories of unjust cruelties and an undeserved death they have suffered, they seek to drive out all living intruders, attacking and vengefully tearing at them while mourning their gloomy fate. Some adventurers believe that white shades are the remains of exceptional heroes and nobles of Drefia that cannot stand the dark summoners' presence in their once beautiful city, not even in death, and so are unable to rest in their graves.
