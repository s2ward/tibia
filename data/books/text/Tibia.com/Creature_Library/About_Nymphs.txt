Nymphs are female nature spirits and usually take the form of beautiful, young maidens who love to dance and sing. They dwell in the hills and forests of Feyrist, often near lakes and streams and they can't die of old age nor illness. On Feyrist, nymphs can be encountered by lone travelers where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool. Such encounters could be dangerous, though, as nymphs generally dislike to be stalked. These fae have a special, strong bond to the plants and animals of their domain and are very protective of Feyrist's flora and fauna. Nymphs emerge from mortals' dreams about love.
