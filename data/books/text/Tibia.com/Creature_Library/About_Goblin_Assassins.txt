All goblins employ stealth and treachery as legitimate means to win a battle. This goes so far that the goblin culture actually encourages and adores such methods. Though Goblin Assassins are hardly anything else than 'wannabe assassins', they are indeed the most tricky and cunning of their kind. They use everything at their disposal for fighting including dirty trick. They enjoy stealthy attacks and the use of paralysing poison to eliminate their enemies. Amongst their kind, they are revered as heroes. They often hold high positions, gained by trickery to get rid of other contenders for leadership. Every goblin chieftain has a bunch of assassins as close advisors. Since the king knows that his advisors would gladly stab him in the back to succeed him as chief, he plays a difficult game of playing off the Goblin Assassins against each other and sending them on suicidal missions to get rid of them. So, being a Goblin Assassin is a mixed blessing. It is desirable as it ensures a position of power which all goblins long for. At the same time, it is a threat for a goblin's life.In battles, Goblin Assassins try to be as effective as necessary to keep their position and as inconspicuous as possible to avoid the attention of both, their opponents and their fellow assassins. To some extend, this restricts the assassin's effectiveness, though when under pressure, he usually plays out all of his tricks to either flee or to kill his opponent.
