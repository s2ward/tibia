Although the Blue Djinns are considered entities of goodness they tend to guard their secrets well from nosy explorers, diligently performing any task they accepted. Being highly magical creatures, they are masters of illusion and transformation. Djinns are known for their witchcraft and fairy-tales commonly narrate about djinns granting people wishes. Magicians often mock this idea, arguing that only djinns bound by powerful magic feel obliged to such duties. Be that as it may, Blue Djinns are the weakest of their kind. Searching the world for the servants of evil and their eternal nemesis, the green djinns, they still pose a threat for all those they suspect of being in league with evil.
