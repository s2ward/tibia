This very rare fish is not a common sight, not even to the eyes of experienced fishermen. With a healthy dose of luck, the Northern Pike can be caught in many lakes across Tibia. Given the ability of going underwater, the adventurous explorer can also experience these frail creatures in their natural habitats. Catching them without a fishing rod, however, can be a challenging task.
