Sharks are some of the most fearful killers that roam the black depths of the seas. They rarely sleep, they focus solely on their prey once they have chosen a victim, and they have enough energy to pursue even the swiftest creatures as they swim fast and extremely efficiently. Beware if you ever encounter a sleeping shark, chances are it is awake and you are just the meal it is resting for.
