Genius and madness are often only a fine line apart. Mad Scientists have for sure crossed that line. Putting their science and researches above everything else, they put themselves above human morals and see other humans as test objects at best.In combat, Mad Scientists fight with everything at their disposal and use a vast array of dirty tricks. Being bad fighters, they use their tools, gadgets and inventions as dangerous weapons. Protective about their secrets and fearing punishment for their amoral experiments, they tend to attack outsiders on sight.Mad Scientists often join confraternities with other scientists to profit from more resources. Others find employment by unscrupulous beings that fund their researches in exchange for their services. Most of them are too absorbed in their researches to become leaders themselves. Some, however, are worldly enough to hire minions and plan and coordinate operations as the scientific mastermind.
