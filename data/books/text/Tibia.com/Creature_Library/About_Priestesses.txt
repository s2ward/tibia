Priestesses came to Edron together with the monks. They are also followers of the evil god Zathroth but they roam the dungeons instead of having a home. Like the monks, they will fiercely attack every intruder into their holy realm. They are weak fighters, but have a lot of magic abilities. They shoot magic missiles at their enemies and drain mana off them, summon ghouls as reinforcements, and heal themselves.
