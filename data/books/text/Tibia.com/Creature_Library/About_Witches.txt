Witches are magically skilled women that usually live deep in the forests and swamps of Tibia. There they collect herbs and other ingredients, e.g. parts of dead animals, from which they brew potions in their large iron cauldrons. Rumour has it that they can fly using their brooms. Most of them are quite malicious and short-tempered and attack adventurers by casting fireballs at them.
