Vampires are undead creatures that live in the haunted ruins on Darama. They are very strong, and live on blood which they suck out of their victims. Dressed with long capes, which are black as night, they are hunting in the dungeons and, at night, even on the surface. Some people actually believe that they are able to fly, like bats which look like small vampires. Their scaring sight and their bloodcurdling cries have already paralysed many brave adventurers.
