The Ancient Scarab is ancient indeed - it is said that there are specimens that are aeons old. Rumours say that unless killed, a scarab will not die of old age but continue to grow and grow to enormous proportions. Their usual pace of movement is not impressively fast, but they are capable of doing sudden charges to catch their opponents off guard. Even more dangerous, their poison is strong enough to allow these creatures to emit large clouds of stinking death and mayhem around themselves. Ancient Scarabs are said to be the keepers of mysterious secrets swallowed by the sands long time ago. So don't be surprised if some of them might display even more cunning tactics and devastating magic.
