Cursed warrior apes rumoured to dwell deep in the Tiquandan jungles. Said to be kin to the Kongra, they hide in the darkness of the jungle and attack from the shadows. Freed from the shackles of feelings like pain and compassion yet filled with insufferable rage, they hunt and kill their prey with furious might. With the origins of their curse unknown and the consequence of an encounter with them most certainly death, it is impossible to determine whether this bane could actually be lifted.
