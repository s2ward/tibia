Over time, different groups of dark summoners developed in Drefia who each follow their own path in using and worshipping the dark powers, loosely allying themselves, or feuding viciously, with another group from time to time. The Blood Priests are a more recent order that reveres the fluids of life and death - above all blood, which they amass in horrendous quantities. Blood priests devote their lives to the study of blood and so-called lesser fluids. They attribute the most stupefying qualities to blood, and experiment extensively with it, using strange devices in their blood hall caverns. This requires a constant supply of fresh fluids and bodies and therefore blood priests and their henchmen are avoided even by their fellow Dark Summoners for fear of their lives. Even their names reflect their love for everything associated with blood and it is said they do not exactly dye their robes blood red. Blood Priests love extravaganza in speech and habit, but they also favour symmetrical shapes and figures - nets, crosses, or abstract tree shapes - shapes that favour a flow and distribution of fluids. Their single-minded extravaganza extends to their love for other species as well. Though rats are usually preferred animals of Urgith and abound in Drefia, blood priests dote on bats, ticks and leeches, and it is even rumoured they have some kind of agreement with the vampires - though nobody dares to imagine to what purpose, and certainly will not ask.
