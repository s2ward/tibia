The usurpers to the throne of the Lion laid siege to the town of Bounac. Their main goal being the fall of king Kesar, they are trying everything in their might to breach the old walls of the castle. Shamefully disregarding the very life and well-being of its inhabitants. The usurper archers are especially keen with the longbow and should not be underestimated even over the longest distances.
