Foxes are medium-sized, omnivorous mammals that live in the forests and mountains of Tibia. They are smaller than wolves and unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some are known to be solitary. They eat insects, small reptiles, birds, mice, eggs and berries.
