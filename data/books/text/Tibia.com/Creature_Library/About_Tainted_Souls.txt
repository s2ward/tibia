If an unlucky mortal gets lost in the swamps and meets his death there, often his soul is unable to find peace. It haunts the bogs as a wraith or ghost light in search of peace and salvation. Such hapless souls may be captured and cursed by evil witches or warlocks, thus transforming into tainted souls that aggressively and enviously attack everything they encounter. There are tales though that it is possible to redeem even these tainted souls.
