Sharing a connection with its bloated counterpart, the Rotten Man-Maggot is a revolting creature held together by additional layers of rot and decay. Its body, a macabre tapestry of putrid flesh and decomposing matter, seems on the verge of disintegration. Foul-smelling gases seep from its decaying form, creating a noxious cloud that precedes its arrival. Like a grotesque puppet, the Rotten Man-Maggot moves with a sickening gait, its movements accompanied by the squelching of decayed flesh. Its jagged, skeletal appendages lash out with surprising speed, fueled by an unholy strength drawn from the very rot that binds its form. It is a macabre testament to the twisted nature of the fallen realm, embodying the horrors that lurk within its darkest corners.
