To become a Lich is the ultimate goal of all those who follow the dark path of necromancy, and there is no one among these lost souls who would not give his life gladly in exchange for the immortality and the frightful powers of these undead wizards. The Lich are true masters of their kind who have learnt to harness the vilest powers of death and corruption, and they know how to channel these unholy energies onto their unfortunate victims with deadly precision. Worse, they typically control legions of lesser undead, so a single Lich may be enough to bring whole cities to ruin. Thankfully, they are very rare and they often prefer to hide in old libraries and laboratories where they ceaselessly continue their wicked research.
