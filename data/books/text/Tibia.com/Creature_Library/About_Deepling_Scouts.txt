The Deepling Scouts are an ancient race. It is not known how old they are exactly or when the first Deepling Scouts emerged from the depths of Tibia's seas. There are no known records of these creatures so far and the first sightings were reported only recently. Usually inhabiting the very depths of the world, it seems their number grew significantly over the years and at some time, they started ascending. It is currently unknown when or why this ascent started. As of now, their origin is shrouded in mystery.
