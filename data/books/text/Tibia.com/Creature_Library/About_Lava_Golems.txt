In the deepest depths of Tibia daring explorers sometimes find ruins that were probably ancient even at the dawn of mankind. Not much has been left by the ravages of time. Pictograms can be found in some places which show a civilised octopus-like race which apparently once dwelt in the deep. On those portrayals the race is served by creatures that look like the Lava Golems we know today. It seems the Lava Golems were once creations, servants or pets of that long extinct race. The fact that the Lava Golems of our time are now in service of 'those below' can be interpreted in many ways. Given the facts, it is most likely that the octopus creatures were conquered and annihilated by 'those below' and their creatures enslaved by the vile conquerors. Now the Lava Golems serve as faithful and unquestioning minions of their new masters. The Lava Golems are astonishingly passionless in their duty, usually doing nothing more than they were ordered to do. They quite obviously lack the destructiveness and rage that seems inherent in the other servants of 'those below'. Their masters coped with this issue by obviously giving them a set of rather broadly defined and extremely destructive orders like killing everything foreign in a certain area. That combined with their sheer power and destructive ability raises them to a completely different level of dangerousness: in the end the Lava Golems have to be seen on par with the other minions of those below.
