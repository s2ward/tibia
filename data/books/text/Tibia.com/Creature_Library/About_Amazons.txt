Amazons are communities of martial women who have erected some hideouts in the swamps in the east of Tibia. They attack every intruder of their sphere vigorously and cut off the heads of their victims in order to keep them as some kind of trophies. They are not only quite strong in close combat but are also able to throw knives with deadly precision.
