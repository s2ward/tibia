Carnisylvans were normal people once. Exposed to a dark ritual at birth, they unwillingly abandoned their former lives to morph into tree-like shadow beings. Some time after coming of age they wander away to fall into a neverending slumber deep underground. Standing in pitch-black darkness, sleeping still, dreaming quaint dreams of death they await the time of joint uprising. Some are born to be chosen custodians of their siblings, awake and sentient.Due to a curse, they have undergone an incomplete metamorphosis and remain human. Their extreme determination and will to defend the Forest of Life, for example, stems from the fact that they deeply feel the need of all their siblings and will fight, if blindly, for their survival. Mumbling and full of aggressiveness. They can be described as deformed humans, connected to a complex hive mind.Poisonous carnisylvans will spit their venomous guile upon all intruders. Like acid, their demonic saliva is not only toxic but also burns the skin and flesh to the bone.
