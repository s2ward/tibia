In ancient times the Green Djinns lost a great war against their blue brethren. Considered to be extinct, the last knowledge of these powerful beings turned into legends and legends became fairy-tales. Those who have encountered the recently resurfaced, self-proclaimed masters of evil can attest that they are indeed, a reality, and not a pleasant one. These magic-wielding enemies of all good embrace destruction and enjoy causing pain. Although only inferior members of the green-skinned race have been sighted until now, they are enemies to beware of. Their magical tricks make them more than a match for unexpecting adventurers. Despising all living beings and everything that is beautiful, their especially passionate hatred is reserved for their blue-skinned relatives, whom they regard as traitors to djinnkind.
