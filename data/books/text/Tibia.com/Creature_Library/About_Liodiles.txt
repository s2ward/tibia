The liodile are best known for their ravenous appetites. The mix of two aggressively carnivorous species with a human lead to the creation of a creature that even puts an ogre's appetite to shame. They spend most of their time looking for something to eat and are prone to phases of lethargic apathy after a good feeding. The liodile is both known for either lying in wait for potential prey or hunting in small packs. In the confined space of the isle Ingol, their aggressiveness is kept in check by feeding them the remains of failed fusions of creatures. Yet they are still occasionally preying on fellow mutants and probably more by accident than design keep the population of Dr. Marrows experimental specimens at bay and relatively stable. As in natural occurring hybrids, the reproduction of Marrow's earliest creations was impossible. The mad yet determined scientist had his first breakthrough in that regard with the creation of the liodiles. Only later he retroactively altered the creation process of most of his other mutants with his new found knowledge. Curiously enough, the liodiles can fertilise themselves and propagate by laying eggs. They shallowly burry the eggs and leave them unattended, seemingly oblivious of their meaning. Liodile eggs are often stolen by other predatory creature and only a few of them are lucky and fertile enough to hatch an offspring. Liodile offspring more closely resembles its crocodile ancestors in the first few months and mature in shallow waters, were they are again targeted by bigger predators. Matured liodiles are regularly rounded up by boar men patrols and brought back to the laboratory area, where they are raised and trained to fit into the mutant society.
