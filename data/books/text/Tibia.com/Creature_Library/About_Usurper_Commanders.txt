The usurpers to the throne of the Lion laid siege to the town of Bounac. Their main goal being the fall of king Kesar, they are trying everything in their might to breach the old walls of the castle. Shamefully disregarding the very life and well-being of its inhabitants. The usurper commanders are battle-hardened veterans who guide their subordinates with wits and an iron fist.
