The Iks were an ancient civilisation of proud warriors, builders and artists long lost to the world of Tibia. Their origins lie far from the known continents, only fragments of obscure lore and cultural remains tell of their history and legacy. A great catastrophe at the evolutionary height of their society led to exile and the scattering of surviving Iks in various parts of Tibia centuries ago. The Aucar are cursed remnants of the once proud Iks warrior caste. They are expertly trained in melee combat, formidable foes utilising a rich set of effective moves and artistic flexibility. They are slower than other Iks but make up for this with raw power and aggressiveness.
