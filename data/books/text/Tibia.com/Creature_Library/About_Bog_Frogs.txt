Bog Frogs came with the rise of the bog temple in Shadowthorn. Formerly normal animals, these vicious little critters have transformed into an abomination of the bog. They are quick and ugly but should not pose a much greater threat than normal frogs. They usually appear in swarms in close vicinity to swamps and lakes.
