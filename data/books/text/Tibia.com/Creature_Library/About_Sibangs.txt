The Sibang seems playful and harmless but this impression is misleading. They use their incredible agility to attack enemies from a safe distance and to swiftly evade counter-attacks. Their hit-and-run tactic proves especially effective in the familiar territory of the jungle. Attacking suddenly from the cover of trees, they throw volleys of different projectiles and then retreat to safety to prepare for their next attack. Ever curious and adventurous, they are the apes that are most often away from their homes. Sometimes they serve as scouts and spies to prepare a bigger assault. Using trees like humans are using roads, it is nearly impossible to catch them.
