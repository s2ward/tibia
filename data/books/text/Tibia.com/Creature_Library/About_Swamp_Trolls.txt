Swamp Trolls are a variety of normal trolls that live in the swamps in the east of Tibia. Like the other tribes of trolls, they hunt animals and seek treasures. But they are a bit stronger and they soak their claws with the extracts of some poisonous herbs they collect in the swamps in order to envenom their opponents. So they can be quite dangerous to inexperienced adventurers.
