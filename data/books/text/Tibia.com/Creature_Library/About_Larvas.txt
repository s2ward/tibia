The Larva of the Daramian desert scarab is a small, yet poisonous insect that usually avoids the sun and dwells only underground. Lacking the hard shells which protect older scarabs and moving rather slowly, they do not pose a too dangerous threat to a well armed warrior. However, in greater numbers they can bring down even a capable foe. Since they usually prefer to remain with their siblings, it is unfortunately not rare to encounter a pack of them at once.
