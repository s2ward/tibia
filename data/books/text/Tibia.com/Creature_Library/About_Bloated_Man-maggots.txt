It is an abomination that defies categorization, leaving observers uncertain whether it was once a humanoid being that became a hive of maggots or a blasphemous amalgamation of maggots cleverly bonded to mock a humanoid shape. The Bloated Man-Maggot is a grotesque entity, pulsating with a nauseating vitality. Thousands of wriggling maggots writhe and squirm within its bloated flesh, their insatiable hunger never sated. The stench of decay and the sickening sound of churning insects accompany its every movement. Despite its repulsive appearance, the Bloated Man-Maggot possesses a perverse strength, its misshapen limbs capable of delivering devastating blows. Those unfortunate enough to witness this abomination in combat are left with a haunting memory that lingers long after the encounter.
