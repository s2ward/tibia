Valkyries are the upper caste of the amazons, communities of martial women living in the swamps in the east of Tibia. They are even stronger in close combat and use their spears skilfully for distance fighting. Every amazon who has proven her bravery by taking the skulls of thirteen opponents will be promoted to a Valkyrie.
