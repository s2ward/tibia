Winter Wolves are related to normal wolves, but they have a thicker, white coat and are a bit stronger. They live at the ice islands in the north-west of Tibia, where they hunt small animals. A single Winter Wolf is rather shy, but as a pride they can be quite dangerous. And when they are hungry they even attack humans.
