Chickens are domesticated animals that usually live on farms. Their eggs and their flesh makes them quite useful and neither the rumour of evil battle chickens nor the myth of a hidden town inhabited by talking chickens turned out to be true. Chickens have accompanied mankind and other races from the beginning and they have spread over the world as civilisation advanced.
