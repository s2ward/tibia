The Draken heritage is one of power and competence. Their training is merciless and their honour leaves little room for failure. All Draken use the best of their abilities to serve the dragon emperor, willing to die for the slightest failure. Yet, only the best of the best make it into the elite of the Draken society. The harsh and rigorous training hones their skills and makes them a living weapon at the disposal of the emperor. Wielding arcane power and weapons alike, the Draken Elite combines this with an impressive physique, turning it into a one man army. Using combat skills and spells, the Draken Elite has just the right answer to any combat situation in its claws.The Draken Elite have become some sort of knightly or religious order in the lizard society. Their grandmaster receives his order only from the dragon emperor himself, and their chapter house is part of the dragon emperor's palace. If the need arises, the emperor lends some of the elite warriors to one of the dragon kings. Sometimes out of need, another time as a boon or token of respect. The elite forces handle even the most trivial duty they are assigned to with precision and unwavering diligence. Often it is sufficient to send a single elite warrior to fulfil a task. When the need arises, small squads are sent which are capable to handle most threats on their own. Given the rarity of the elite forces, such squads are only seen under dire circumstances. Actually it seems that the elite forces are that accustomed to work alone that they do not even get along well with other members of the elite, let alone with 'lesser' warriors at the empire's disposal.
