Scorpions live in the swamps and deserts of Tibia. They usually hunt small animals but when they get excited they even attack humans. Their very poisonous sting penetrates even thick armor so that they can be a great threat when they attack surprisingly. As their defence is quite weak you should strive to do the first strike.
