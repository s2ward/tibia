Bulltaur Brutes are the most physically imposing members of their species, standing taller than the average Bulltaur and boasting incredible strength and stamina. Their unwavering devotion and deep-rooted believe of the Great Father Forge and Mother Fire, their otherwise nameless gods who bless their craftsmanship ensure their loyalty to their sacred leaders. They view every product of the bulltaur's forges as a sacred gift, which they proudly display in the form of elaborate tattoos and the armor and weaponry worn. Despite their brutish nature, they are rather simple-minded and superstitious, often deferring to the wisdom of their elders and leaders, whom they blindly follow. This makes them easy targets for manipulations by priests and astrologers that use them as pawns in their power games. Their every action is governed by their unyielding belief in the divine origins of their forged equipment, making their use in war a sacred act, often accompanied by simple battle prayers. Some among their kind revere the occasional warrior saints, who scholars see as remnants of a long forgotten war-cult that was obliterated but not entirely erased when the Forge Cult claimed dominance. Squads of brutes are often accompanied by an alchemist 'advisor' who is responsible for tactics that he acquires from horoscopes and reading the stars.
