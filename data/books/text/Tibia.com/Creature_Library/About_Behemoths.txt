Behemoths are giant monsters that live in the ancient town deep below Edron. They look a bit like cross-breeds of humans and bulls and even talk in human language, but nobody knows yet where they come from. Although they are of minor intelligence, they are very strong fighters and throw huge stones at their opponents.
