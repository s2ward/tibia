War Wolves are a race of fearsome beasts bred by orcs. They are much larger than their less dangerous cousins from which they evolved, reaching up to five feet in height, and in fact orcs often use them as mounts to ride on. However, War Wolves are dangerous opponents in their own right, endowed with awesome strength and vicious, razor-sharp teeth that can cut through armour and flesh alike. Also, War Wolves have proven to be so cunning in battle that some scholars believe these animals have acquired some kind of semi-intelligence. Of course these may only be rumours, but there can be no doubt that War Wolves hate all civilised races just as ardently as their masters do. A War Wolf will always fight to the death.
