Even more bloodthirsty than the other quara and even feared by their own kind for their murderous frenzy, Quara Predators are usually found in the first lines of a battlefield whenever the quara decide to fight their sworn enemies (which basically means all non-quara). Obviously a mixture of quara and sharks, they share the most disgusting and most lethal attributes of both. Ruthless and vicious they know no mercy and no surrender. Quara Predators are known to fight until the last spark of life leaves their bodies. Sometimes they even fight against each other after slaying all enemies in sight.On shore they are somewhat weaker, losing their speed and agility, but their huge jaws are still fatal.
