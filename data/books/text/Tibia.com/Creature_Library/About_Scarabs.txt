The Scarab is in general associated with buried secrets and wisdom, which made this beetle an important religious symbol for the city of Ankrahmun. Typically found in their underground lairs, they also inhabit sacred places such as temples or tombs. Scarabs protect their charge with ferocious intent. They will attack anyone who dares to intrude their area and will not relent until the threat is eliminated. Their shells are immensely hard and sometimes weapons might get caught in their chitinous armor. They are able to concentrate their poison in a deadly cloud of nauseating fumes that especially cover their retreat if overwhelmed.
