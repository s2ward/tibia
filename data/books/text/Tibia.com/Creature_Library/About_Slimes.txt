Slimes are not real creatures but very strange entities which occur in the dungeons of Tibia. They move by flowing rather than walking. Their favourite tactic is to enclose an enemy by separating and floating around him. Their attack is quite heavy, but their defence is weak. Upon their death, they turn into a cloud of poisonous gas that vanishes quickly into thin air.
