Fused by burning unlight, the Walking Pillars are towering monstrosities driven by a malicious purpose. These hulking entities are formed from an unholy union of colossal stones and the malevolent essence of the fallen realm. As they roam the desolate landscapes, their footsteps reverberate with a bone-rattling intensity, sending tremors through the ground. Burning with a dim, maleficent glow, their stony surfaces crack and shift, revealing glimpses of the volatile darklight contained within. The Walking Pillars possess an unrelenting determination, wielding their massive limbs to unleash devastating attacks upon any who dare cross their path. Their malevolent presence casts a foreboding shadow upon the land, a constant reminder of the ever-present dangers that lurk in the fallen realm.
