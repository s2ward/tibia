If there is a seemingly unstoppable force in the ranks of demon kind, it is the infamous Juggernaut. Thought to become extinct in the great wars of the gods, recent sightings of Juggernauts have proven those rumours wrong. Raised in the playpens of the deepest hells, where only the most powerful can survive, about 90% of the Juggernaut population is killed before it reaches adulthood. Those who are not torn into pieces by their merciless brethren or other creatures, grow to enormous, frightening killing machines. Juggernauts are known to be able to slash the head of a dragon with one hit, while fighting back a half-dozen of other dragons. The earth trembles where a Juggernaut walks, heralding the incoming of doom. Seemingly being made up only of armor and muscles, the Juggernaut is incredibly powerful and fast, killing the first opponent and walking to the next in a mere blink. Serving as one-creature armies, the Juggernauts are some of the most powerful weapons at the disposal of the demonlords.
