Chakoya Toolshapers are more skilled than the tribewardens but less powerful built. Provided with a bit more intelligence than the other chakoyas, they are mainly responsible for handcraft in the tribes. It is them who provide the tribes with all kinds of different weapons and who are able to handle the more complicated distance weapons in fights.Since supplies are hard to gather in the northern waste, Chakoya Toolshapers often accompany the tribewardens on their hunts for food and resources. In battles they function as leaders, at least until the frenzy takes over. As running away is no option for a chakoya that does not want to end as dinner for its clanmates, Chakoya Toolshapers, unlike other distance fighters, charge an enemy with little regard of their own safety.
