The Lost are some of the dwarfs that never joined one of the dwarven communities and aimlessly wandered the depths of the world in search of refuge. Sometimes in the ancient past they were found by 'those below' and cruelly enslaved by the masters of the depths. After generations of slavery and breeding, those dwarfs have lost all memory of their ancestry and culture, rendering them hardly more than aggressive animals of war. They lack a complicated language, communicating only with select gnarls and snarls. Their entire bitter lives are centred around battle and carnage. After their masters have completely broken their will, the Lost march in unquestioning obedience into battle whenever their cruel slavers order them to do so. It is hard to tell what motivation drives them. They seem not to revere to their masters in any way and show no joy in battle. The only emotion they are showing is incredible anger that rivals that of a rabid animal.
