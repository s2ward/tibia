Ice Golems are constructs raised by powerful sorcery. The creation of Ice Golems dates back to times no mortal can remember. Golems follow simple tasks, given to them by their masters. Often, they are ordered to protect some place or item and they are still bound to this duty even when their masters are already dead for a long time. This is only one of the reasons why most encountered Ice Golems are hostile. Another less known fact is that the structure of the Ice Golem's feeble mind makes it easy for all kinds of spirits to possess these creatures and to take over control. Thus the Ice Golems are easy to be 'ridden' by such entities and especially malignant spirits have little qualms to do so.The strength and resilience of Ice Golems is quite similar to other golems. They tend to be a bit faster and more agile compared to stone golems but are not that heavily armoured. They are only able to survive in cold climate as Ice Golems will melt in warmer regions unless some kind of magic is applied to prevent this. In cooler areas it is much easier to raise Ice Golems than their stone cousins. As a rule of thumb, Ice Golems are usually encountered in greater numbers than stone golems.
