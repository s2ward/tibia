Bulltaur Alchemists play a pivotal and multifaceted role in the Bulltaur race. These enigmatic, esteemed members of their species are scholars deeply entwined with the celestial, their alchemy intertwined with the vast expanse of the night sky and therefore astrology. They serve as soothsayers and fortune tellers, their arcane insights often shaping political decisions. Deeply entwined in their own, often convoluted belief system, they are often bound to odd behavioural patterns to appease the forces of fate. In their world, alchemist cabals continually scheme and connive against one another, fiercely competing for influence in the ever-evolving tapestry of their society. A substantial portion of their work and research is dedicated to the mystical pursuit of enhancing their forging capabilities, crafting novel alloys with wondrous properties. Following their teachings, mixing alchemy and astrology, they try to find the perfect alloy, created at the perfect alignment of stars.
