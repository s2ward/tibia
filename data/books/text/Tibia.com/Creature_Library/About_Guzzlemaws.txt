The guzzlemaw is a larger variation of the frazzlemaw. Not only will they bite even heftier, they can actually swallow a person up in one nibble. They almost know no fear and seem to follow strange patterns and routines. Somehow these big maws have erected shrines for a probably non-existent god they worship as the "Overmaw". It is better to make short work of them as they are often surrounded by a pack of smaller guzzlemaws and wouldn't hesitate to call even more of them to join their fray.
