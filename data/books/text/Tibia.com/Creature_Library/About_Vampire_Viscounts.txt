Always with an air of style, insouciant and sniggering, the Viscount ambles through undeath looking for the next blood drink, entertaining fight or other pleasure to while away eternity. Viscounts can be charming in a casual way, but only to distract their prey until the final bite - they say it sours the flavour when their meal is scared or distressed. Masters of the rapier, they love to see their enemy bleed, heightening the pleasant anticipation of the kill while simultaneously letting their victim believe it could still win the fight. When hurt or when trying to impress his foe, the Viscount will eventually change form to scare his opponent away, and take on the shape of a vicious manbat.
