Coming from the lowest classes of society, it is easy to recruit those low-life guises into the pirates crews. Often already criminals before their career as a pirate, it is no big step for most of them to live a pirate's life. Lured by tales about freedom and treasuries, they become quickly disillusioned when facing reality.No better than a common bandit on land, Pirate Marauders care little for the health or the lives of others. Due to their living conditions they have turned into bitter and angry people who try to strike back at life by tormenting and suppressing others whenever possible. As weapons they use everything that they can purloin and loot and serves the purpose.Their agility makes up for their lack of armor. Fairly weak and cowardly, it is rather their number than their skill that might pose a threat.
