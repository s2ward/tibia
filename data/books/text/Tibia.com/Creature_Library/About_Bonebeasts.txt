The result of an unspeakable ritual that mocks the holy secrets of creation, the Bonebeast is a harbinger of doom and pestilence. It is best described as a hideous conglomerate of bones and rotten flesh vaguely resembling a bull. Bonebeasts are often created by some unscrupulous lich, and they mindlessly obey their master's orders no matter what they are. More often than not, these orders include impaling one or more hapless victims on one of the Bonebeast's massive horns.
