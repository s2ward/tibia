Although Gargoyles are a common sight all over Tibia, the origin of this remarkable species remains clouded in mystery. In fact, a reward offered by the great wizard Cyrius the Half-Bald to those who could solve the mystery was never claimed. However, one or two interesting facts have been discovered. It is widely agreed today that Gargoyles prefer dark places,which is why they are typically found in dreary dungeons and other subterranean complexes. There they breed and hunt, using their uncanny ability to blend in with the stony surfaces of their lairs.
