The Dire Spectres arrived as phantoms to this world. Born from dark fragments of lost souls, they are not bound to this plane, nor do they have a past. They long for a physical existence and their sole goal is to anchor themselves to our world. They are literally pure evil woven from bad spare parts of souls and feed on the life energy of any living creature. The most powerful dire spectres are the oldest. Those who clung to this plane for long enough, eventually gained adequate power to control and coordinate other spectres. Those are the most dangerous and resourceful and should be treated with the utmost care. Burster Spectres wield the most powerful magic among dire spectres. Their attacks are quick and devastating, often emanating in abrupt and hazardous bursts of raw energy.
