Though relying on a diet of plant matter, the hostile environment of Gnomprona made this creature aggressive beyond reason. Aggression seems to be the driving force of their behaviour pattern as they even tend to ram trees until they break and fall, to later feast on otherwise unreachable leafs. Though they mostly graze on more reachable plants, its the mentioned behaviour that sticks to the memory of an observer mostly and serves as an ample warning to approach this creature with care as it eventually will inevitably attack. It doesn't matter, what the Gore Horn is distracted with in the moment, they attack anything on sight, assuming it's just another predator of the subterranean lands. Despite their individual prowess, the Gore horns tend to form small groups or even herds, to rely on strength in numbers. Such groups of Gore Horns stick together closely and rather die together than to leave one of their own back. They are even known to relentlessly attack a predator that already killed one of their herd, protecting it's corpse for quite some time. And they are even more protective towards their young ones though those often hide in thickets nearby. Sometimes such a herd of gore horns gets into a stampede in which they stomp down everything in their path. While the increase of volcanic activity was still a new thing in Gnomprona such stampedes were often observed, sometimes ending by the herd mindlessly plunging itself in the surrounding ocean and drown. Since then the creatures have to have grown accustomed to it and a stampede is a rather rare occurrence again. Oddly enough for such massive and relatively clumsy lizards they often build lairs deep in caves or even the underground. Certain findings suggest that they use volcanic heat to help them hatch their eggs and that might be the major reason, they dwell in caves, close to the volcanic heart of the area, though the attraction of cold blooded creatures to heat might be another reason.
