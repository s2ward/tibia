The Death Blob is the undead version of the well-known green slime. While the green slime is constantly absorbing living things as a source of food, the Death Blob is less picky in this matter. It devours everything that comes into contact with it. Death Blobs are even able to dissolve harder materials using its gastric juices.Death Blobs arise out of green slimes. In the course of centuries, a green slime tends to eat quite a lot of negative energy which usually comes in form of cursed objects, undead material, demonic remains and other sources. This negative energy slowly poisons the slime up to the point where the ordinary green slime turns into a black undead slime, consisting of a huge amount of negative energy. The undead characteristics make the Death Blob quite a strong opponent. Although it has quite some power and extra abilities, it seems to be driven by its primitive instincts and only aims to destroy everything in its way.
