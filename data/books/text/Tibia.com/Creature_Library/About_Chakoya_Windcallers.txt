The Chakoya Windcallers are a strange breed of chakoyas. Just a few of these rare and quite fragile chakoyas actually reach adulthood where they can acquire their full potential. Only if other Chakoya Windcallers recognise the ability of a child to wield magic, it may be spared from the deadly pecking order of the clans. The Chakoya Windcallers are considered as a mixture of saints and abominations, certainly nothing any sane chakoya would eat. Touched with the gift or curse of magic, a young Chakoya Windcaller usually grows up under the relative safety of a Chakoya Windcaller patron that serves as its teacher. In some rare cases, a Chakoya Windcaller survives on its own, rather relying on its instinctive magic than on its brawn. As an adult, a Chakoya Windcaller has either been recognised and raised as such or gradually begins to lose its magic abilities, mostly turning into a Chakoya Toolshaper instead.The magic of the Chakoya Windcallers is rather primitive. They use the elements for protection, enhancement or damaging effects. Like every chakoya, they rely on close combat so their ability to cast distance spells is limited. Instead they use their magical skills to increase their own speed and to freeze their opponents.
