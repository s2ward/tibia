A curse, necromancy or some magic plague has turned the Undead Gladiator in his current state. Unlike other undead, his will power and determination let him retain a certain degree of his former self. A few gladiators were even able to stay almost the complete same person considering personality and intelligence which makes them to especially fearsome opponents. Undead Gladiators can wield a large variety of weapons, and their undead state has even enhanced their fighting skills. Without any moral restraints, immune to pain, and tireless, an Undead Gladiator is a virtual fighting machine that wears down his opponent before he finishes them off in a burst of skilful attacks.Without the need for sleep or food, their existence has turned into a constant battle, a permanent test of their skills. They strive for perfection, but ironically, their undead state prevents them from enhancing their skills further or to train their body. So the emptiness of their existence is haunting them every moment, and feeds the rage and jealousy towards the living.Undead Gladiators often participate in gruesome duels with each other to test their skills in a macabre and tireless dance of death, sometimes lasting for days.
