Unless other creatures from beyond, the Reality Reaver seems to follow regular patterns of behaviour, as it does not cause the random destruction in the same way that others of its kind do. However, just because the Reality Reaver possesses a form that follows predictable patterns to an extend which other beings do not, it is not yet in possession of sentience.This being said, the Reality Reaver is just as malignant as the rest of its ilk. However, it has certain characteristics that are more often found in ordinary creatures, whereas the other "newly created" are closer in nature to a tornado or a wildfire. For instance, it has been reported that it creates small flocks of its own kind in order to attack in a pack. Still, even a single Reality Reaver is a force to be reckoned with.The Reality Reaver seems somewhat more stable than the rest of its kind. While the others regularly dissolve and re-form, even in the realm beyond, the Reality Reaver is more anchored in our reality and with that, one step further towards our plane of existence. It cannot be foreseen what this means for our future.Whether or not the current crisis can be averted, one thing is certain; an invasion of these creatures can no longer be prevented. The very existence of the Reality Reaver and its ability to manifest in a concrete form is an indication that our reality's laws of probability helps these incursions to evolve into a more stable state of existence, which makes them more dangerous. The Reality Reaver is already very dangerous and destructive, but the aspect that it evolves in our world makes the Reality Reaver even more unnerving. Scholars have proven themselves inadequate to the task of classifying these new creatures. They have categorised them as "forces of destruction". Equally erroneously, they have labelled the Reality Reaver as a "destruction golem". This classification is so obviously wrong that it would never stand a close examination.
