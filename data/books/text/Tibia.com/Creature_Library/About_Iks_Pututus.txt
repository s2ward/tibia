The Iks were an ancient civilisation of proud warriors, builders and artists long lost to the world of Tibia. Their origins lie far from the known continents, only fragments of obscure lore and cultural remains tell of their history and legacy. A great catastrophe at the evolutionary height of their society led to exile and the scattering of surviving Iks in various parts of Tibia centuries ago. The Pututu are cursed remnants of the warrior priests of the Iks. Their knowledge of arcane powers, nature's mysteries and intricate rituals provides them with a variety of deadly skills in combat. Their role in ancient Iks society was to be servants and an executive to high priests, Ahpututu. Shortly before the collapse of the Iks society, they often carried out their will with cold consequence and cruelty.
