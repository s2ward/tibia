The Hellspawn is a creature that is neither fully a demon nor a living creature. They are grotesque hybrids being the result of experiments to breed certain demons with beasts. Their appearance and level of intelligence can vary widely, though a number of them are so deformed that they do not even survive birth. Some Hellspawns look very much like their beast parent and often are mistaken for some animal until they show their devastating powers. The majority of Hellspawns, however, looks quite alike as the cross-breeding of demons with beasts seems to result in a certain appearance. Hellspawns are wild, always hungry and have a short temper.Even though, they are very strong, they prefer sneak attacks and to fight in groups. If cornered, a Hellspawn will fight with a fearsome ferocity that uses the power and skills of both inherited species.Possessing demonic immortality, the Hellspawn usually outlives its original purpose and is then abandoned by its creators. Hellspawns are often quite attached to their surrounding, and might stay in an area for decades or even centuries. Sometimes, however, they grow restless and start to roam the world in search for a new territory. For this reason, it is possible to encounter a Hellspawn almost anywhere.
