The shrewd Quara Mantassins are often not recognised until it's too late. Like all quara, they have undergone massive modifications of their bodies which have made them an own subspecies. Especially in their native, maritime habitat, they are masters of camouflage and disguise. However, also on land they are known for stealthy sneak attacks. But away from their natural element, the water, they are weaker and easier to defeat.Usually they serve their race in special operations and they are the ones that target the leaders of their enemies in big battles. With an arsenal of tricks the Quara Mantassin are quite capable on their own. Their love for covert operations gives them their place in the quaran warfare but they are not seen too often in open battles. On the other hand, a Quara Mantassin that you do not see is four times deadlier than a Quara Mantassin that you do see.
