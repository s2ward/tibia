The Efreet are the merciless leaders of the green djinns. Surpassing their lesser brethren both in power and in cruelty, the Efreet are truly terrible opponents who love to use their awesome powers to spread havoc among their enemies or sometimes among their own kind. The disdain they feel towards all other sentient races is second only to the undying hatred they feel towards their blue-skinned relatives, the Marid.
