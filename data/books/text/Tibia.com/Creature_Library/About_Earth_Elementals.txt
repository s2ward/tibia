Followers of Crunor claim that Earth Elementals mirror the wrath of Tibia's land. All the abuse and mistreatment of the earth caused an elemental subconsciousness to wake up and to send the powerful Earth Elementals to seek revenge on the living creatures. It is said that Earth Elementals form spontaneously, so to speak anywhere and not necessarily at a place where the earth has been defiled. The Earth Elementals seem mindless, guided only by some mystic field that spans the whole world according to the followers of Crunor. If an Earth Elemental is disconnected from this field, it becomes increasingly violent and destructive. It starts a rampage that eventually will lead to its own destruction. However, even the Earth Elementals that are connected to this field are by no means peaceful creatures. They follow a universal instinct that often leads to conflicts with living beings. The ultimate goal might be to bring some kind of universal balance; but to achieve this goal, much violence is used, relying on the enormous strength and resilience of the Earth Elementals.
