The Bulltaur Forge Priests are the revered and mighty leaders of their race. Born into priestly families and indoctrinated from their earliest days, they are unwavering, unflinching devotees of Father Forge and Mother Flame, convinced in their superiority and right to to rule. Within Bulltaur culture, the Forge symbolizes both birth and death, in an twisting of traditional roles that challenges and reshapes their beliefs. Their strength and ingenuity are the hallmarks of their people, with their self-made weapons and armor serving as a testament to their skill and determination. The highest-ranking priest, known as the Priest-King, is typically the strongest among them and is chosen through a trial by combat, relying on self-fashioned weapons and armor to assert their authority and leadership. The bulltaurs leading castes awaits the arrival of the prophetized forge-born, a mythical figure that is supposed to lead their people into an age of unparalleled craftsmanship that will ultimately lead to the recreation of the world by Father Forge and Mother Flame into a perfect version ruled over by the bulltaurs, reforged in perfect, metal bodies.
