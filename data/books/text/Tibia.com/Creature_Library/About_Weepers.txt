The Weepers are more living minerals than anything else. Though the gnomes fiercely deny it, it can be assumed that the Weepers served as inspiration for the construction of the first crystal golems. As an oddity of life, Weepers physically share only a few characteristics with truly living beings. It is all the more astonishing that in appearance and behaviour they could be confused with biological live forms. This raises a lot of questions about the Weepers and is fuel to dozens of more or less educated guesses about their origin. Some speculations see them as surviving servants of a long extinct race. Others point out the possibility that they are the offspring of early gnomish experiments. Some see the Weepers more in the array of elemental beings, going so far as to say that the Weepers are the incarnation of a new and to date undiscovered element. They got their name from the fiery 'tears' that usually leak in what would be considered their eye region as well as the odd sobbing sounds it emanates. Weepers are extremely unpredictable in their behaviour. The only constant seems to be their hatred for biological life which they attack fiercely and without restraint.
