Dark Torturers are distant relatives of the diabolic imps. Like all members of the imp family, they enjoy pain and havoc they wreak upon other creatures. Their physical abilities exceed by far those of their cousins, the diabolic imps. Since they lack the magical affinity of the latter, those creatures tend to sell their services to more powerful demons or even some malicious mortals. Given their somewhat lazy and cowardly nature, they prefer to take up the roles of jailers and torturers. There they can indulge their malicious instincts without risking too much in open warfare. Those disgusting qualities have earned this race the fitting name Dark Torturer in the vernacular.
