Skeletons are undead monsters that live in the dungeons of Tibia. It is rumoured that they are the bodies of dead adventurers that have been revived by some evil power. Cropping up in packs and occasionally accompanied by other undead creatures like ghouls, they are quite nasty opponents, particularly because they are able to drain life energy off their opponents.
