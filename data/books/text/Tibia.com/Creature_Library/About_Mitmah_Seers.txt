With a long history of invading a colourful palette of the exotic civilisations in different dimensions, the Mitmah are intruders, marauders, thieves. They robbed whole continents of their cultures and legacy, stole treasure, art and even whole monuments and structures including their inhabitants all and sundry. Yet they see themselves as benefactors. Vanguards of art and culture, history and the legacy of all kinds of ancient beings. Creators of unforgettable experiences and builders of museums and exhibitions accross an interdimensional array of countless exotic realms. The Mitmah seer is a specifically vile specimen which utilises his magical abilities to a maximum while hiding inside a fortified metal case of unknown origin. Seemingly impenetrable they wield their arcane powers efficiently and with finesse.
