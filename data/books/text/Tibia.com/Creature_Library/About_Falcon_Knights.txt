Falcon Knights are members of the Order of the Falcon. A once honourable and revered order of knights. They fell victim to a curse centuries ago and are now mere shadows of their former, noble self. The mighty knights are expertly trained and can prove an unsurmountable obstacle in combat. These relentless warriors are still bound to their oaths and will defend the order to the death.
