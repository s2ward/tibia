With a long history of invading a colourful palette of the exotic civilisations in different dimensions, the Mitmah are intruders, marauders, thieves. They robbed whole continents of their cultures and legacy, stole treasure, art and even whole monuments and structures including their inhabitants all and sundry. Yet they see themselves as benefactors. Vanguards of art and culture, history and the legacy of all kinds of ancient beings. Creators of unforgettable experiences and builders of museums and exhibitions accross an interdimensional array of countless exotic realms. The scouts of the Mitmah are fast and versatile, yet protected by a solid coat of metal armour. As all Mitmah are not born warriors but rather cowardly manipulators, they hide in cases of metal and let their magic do the work for them. From the outside this doesn't take away from the fact, however, that they are absolutely not to be trifled with and still pose a formidable threat.
