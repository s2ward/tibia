Sheep are domestic animals which are kept by farmers and herdsmen. They have been raised by humans for a long time to gain meat and wool. They are absolutely peaceable and live as herds in sheepfolds or on pastures. However, the owners will be upset if you kill one of them. A Tibian saying states that there is a black sheep in every herd.
