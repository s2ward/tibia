Necromancers are powerful magicians who pursue studies on undead creatures in the haunted ruins of Drefia on Darama.Nobody knows what they intend to use their perilous knowledge for and which dreadful secrets they already have discovered, but adventurers, who have managed to escape from their realm, report that they are able to summon several kinds of undead creatures like skeletons, ghouls, and mummies. They can heal themselves and they know how to drain life energy off their opponents. Although they are quite strong fighters, they prefer distance fighting, namely shooting magic missiles and letting their summoned servants fight for them.
