Stone Golems are kind of living rocks. All their limbs are out of stone, and they live on stones. They live in the dungeons of Edron, where they find their favourite food, granite with quartz. Normally, they are peaceful, but they can get very angry about adventurers trampling on their food and try to slay the intruder using their incredible power.
