The Darklight Sources are malignant constructs of darklight and stone, unlike their mindless brethren, possessing a palpable hatred for the truly living beings that venture into the fallen realm. These abominations pulse with a malefic energy, their crystalline forms infused with the corrupted essence of the darklight. They stand as guardians of the realm's twisted secrets, channeling the decaying energy to unleash devastating attacks upon any perceived intruders. The Darklight Sources radiate an aura of malevolence, casting an eerie glow that illuminates their surroundings with an unholy light. The air crackles with suppressed power in their presence, as if the very fabric of reality recoils from their dark influence. To confront a Darklight Source is to face an entity fueled by hatred and dark intent, a testament to the fallen realm's malevolent nature.
