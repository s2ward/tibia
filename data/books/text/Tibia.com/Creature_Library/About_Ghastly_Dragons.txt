Ghastly Dragon is the best translation one can come up with for the unpronounceable word that the lizard people use for this creature. It seems the Ghastly Dragon is not a sub-race of the dragons but some sort of intended transformation. Sages assume that Ghastly Dragons are the failed result of a self-initiated transformation of some ancient dragon. While probably the original aim is to reach some state of transcendence, the failed outcome is a creature trapped between the spirit world and the mortal realm. The failed transformation often dangerously maddens the dragon creature. Even those who against all odds manage to retain their sanity have to cope with the knowledge that they turned in some, even in their own eyes, abominable creature instead in the intended ascended being. This leads to the fact that also the few sane specimens are usually not less aggressive and destructive than their mad fellows.Although the legends of the lizard folk also tell about some extremely wise and benevolent Ghastly Dragons, most of them that have been encountered are dangerous and powerful. The transformation of their bodies has changed their abilities significantly. They can draw upon immense powers and use them to wreak havoc on anyone foolish enough to disturb them in their eternal agony.
