Freakish lost souls are some of the more self aware souls which, caught in their own cycle of damning thoughts, will still posses some form of animalistic instincts of self preservation. In a subconscious way they have learned to fight back the many attackers and predators that roam the nether realms. Still they often lack the power or finesse to fend off their attackers and are left scarred and changed forever. Somewhat battle-hardened they change over time and become an own subcategory of entity. On the surface they are like animals while in their core they are just another tormented soul, captured in this ghostly shell they subconsciously animate. In the contrary to flimsy lost souls, freakish souls like animals can actually learn things and react purposely, albeit with rather limited intelligence. In rare occasions a spiritualist was able to reach the trapped consciousness in a freakish lost soul and had a form of limited conversation, which rendered the instinctive side of the soul inactive for the remainder of the contact. As soon as the contact is broken, however, the animal takes over again and reacts extremely angry and hostile, using all of its capabilities to attack immediately. It seems that other, more conscious inhabitants of the nether worlds are able to train and exploit them for their own sinister purposes. As such they are often used as attack and watch dog-like creatures by their masters and can even be encountered in areas they would instinctively avoid on their own. Any attempts to awaken the dormant souls and to have them attain control over their state have met with little useful results. Especially those entities touched and trained by the more tainted seem beyond any help and redemption.
