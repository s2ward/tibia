It is said that the Wyrm is a distant and primitive relative of the dragon. Dragons, on the other hand, oppose this theory like a human would oppose the theory that an orc is a primitive relative of a human. In the end, the distinction is of no importance if you face such a creature. While it lacks the fire breath of a dragon, it is still a creature of heat that knows how to melt snow and ice while passing through it. What it lacks in magic, it makes up with sheer strength. It is a much better fighter than ordinary dragons and astonishingly agile, almost like a snake. A Wyrm's teeth are prized by dwarfs since they easily cut through most materials. The Wyrm indiscriminately eats minerals and meat alike, and it is said that you sometimes find valuable metals in the excrements in their lairs. The Wyrm is a powerful predator that does not back away from attacking small towns in times of hunger. Their territory is usually quite large, though they tend to stay in their lairs most of the time. Wyrms are quite intelligent compared to other animals. Still, they are not capable of speech and at best understand a few short commands just like a trained dog. Of course, training a Wyrm is easier said than done. However, there are some scrupulous beings that capture young Wyrms and train them for their evil plans.
