Fiercer than the dreaded orc berserker and more powerful even than the mighty orc leader, the Orc Warlord is the true terror of all civilised races. Orc Warlords are the strongest fighters of their race who have managed to rise to the highest ranks through treachery and murder. Even though they are extremely skilled fighters who can cut a man in two with a single stroke of their mighty blades, Orc Warlords prefer to use their superior speed and cunning to overcome their enemies. They avoid open combat whenever they can, sneaking up on unwary adventurers from behind or throwing their vicious shuriken instead.
