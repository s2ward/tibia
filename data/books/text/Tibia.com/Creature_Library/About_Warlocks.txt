Warlocks are among the most powerful magicians of Tibia, but they do their research not for the benefit of mankind but only for their own interests. Nobody, however, knows what their plans are, hiding deep in the dungeons of Tibia and attacking and killing every intruder of their sphere, so that hardly any information about them can permeate.Of course, Warlocks know a lot of fighting spells. They can shoot fire and energy in various forms, summon stone golems as vassals, paralyse their victims and drain mana off them. Moreover, they know how to heal themselves and how to make themselves invisible.
