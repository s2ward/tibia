The most intelligent bird in the known world is the colourful Parrot. It is even possible to teach it a few words. It is disputed if the bird is actually aware of what it is saying, after all a Parrot is at most as smart as an orc or a troll. The bird is usually unaggressive and in the wilderness it flees as soon as someone approaches it. Caught Parrots can be tamed and trained though. It takes some patience to teach them some simple sentences but the patience is ultimately rewarded with a funny companion whose buffoonery amuses its owner.
