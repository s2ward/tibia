Werewolves are humans under a curse that causes them to lose control over their inner beasts. At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation starts more and more early and lasts for a longer time. At a certain point, the beast takes over and there is no return. The human part is washed away by rage and primal instincts. The cursed person has turned into a savage Werewolf permanently.Werewolves are ferocious beasts who enjoy the thrill of a hunt. They are unnatural born hunters that have many traits of a wolf, but are much more dangerous and lethal. Like wolves, a Werewolf claims a large hunting ground as its own and everything alive is seen as a suitable prey. Unlike wolves, werewolves do not only hunt for food, but also for the thrill of the hunt itself. Their magical nature makes them extremely resistant and their regeneration powers are legendary.The curse of the Werewolf is usually spread by the infectious bite of other werewolves. Forbidden books tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a Werewolf with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.
