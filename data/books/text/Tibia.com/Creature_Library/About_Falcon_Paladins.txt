Falcon Paladins are members of the Order of the Falcon. A once honourable and revered order of knights. They fell victim to a curse centuries ago and are now mere shadows of their former, noble self. The powerful paladins are masters of the bow and crossbow. Their arrows rarely miss and whatever still stands where one of them hits, is brought to fall by the other paladin you didn't see. Their will to protect the order is unbroken and they are formidable enemies on almost every account.
