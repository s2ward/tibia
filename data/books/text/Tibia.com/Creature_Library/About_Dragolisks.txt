Dracolisks are a heretical creation among dragonkind, designed to rival the fabled basilisks with a dark and potent grace. While they may not quite match the basilisks' otherworldly power, dracolisks are undeniably menacing and dangerous creatures, which is amplified by their malicious shrewdness. These dragons bear a subtle, smouldering resentment toward their kin, their bitterness manifesting as sarcasm and cunning. Harbouring little sympathy for other dragons, they are unusually comfortable amongst other dracolisks, forming cabals and circles to work towards common goals. As longtime goals and personal ambitions seldom align, for most of the time a dracolisk is often a loner, following its own agenda. Dracolisks excel in manipulation through their dark intellect and deceptive wiles, relishing in the slow torture, subversion, and ultimate destruction of individuals and communities. Instead of relying on brute force, they take pleasure in devious tactics like poisoning wells and abducting villagers to accomplish their sinister objectives.
