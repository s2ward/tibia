The actual Energy Elemental is just a tiny spark that can be hardly spotted. The origin of those sparks is unknown, but their creation has been attributed to natural forces. This malicious spark strives for nothing more than mayhem and havoc. Although it is not necessarily evil, it is definitely cruel and careless. In the state of a spark, it swirls around for a while until it has gathered enough electrical charges and stirred up the wind to turn into a small storm. By 'riding' this storm, the elemental becomes more substantial and significantly dangerous.Hurling mighty energy attacks and being almost insubstantial, Energy Elementals are extremely dangerous. They have some intelligence and actually enjoy blasting their enemies with powerful lightnings. Energy Elementals can be encountered almost everywhere, as they can spawn at any place that contains some air. Their main attacks are lightnings and forceful gusts of wind, but they can also cause some form of suffocation. Almost as fast as lightning, it is hardly impossible to escape from an Energy Elemental unless it is temporarily destroyed. It can regenerate itself by drawing air from the surrounding area. Capricious as a storm, it is very unpredictable in combat and even experienced adventurers can hardly foretell how an Energy Elemental will behave.
