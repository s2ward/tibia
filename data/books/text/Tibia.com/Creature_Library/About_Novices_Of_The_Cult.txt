The members of the lowest rank of the sinister cult still lack any greater powers but are eager to prove themselves worthy. Their inherent cowardice is somewhat compensated by first signs of fanaticism. Determined to protect their cult, they are capable but not too impressive opponents. What they lack in strength, they try to make up with quantity. Usually Novices of the Cult band together for a fight, often accompanied by a member of a higher rank whom they protect with their lives. Quite clueless about the true agendas and teachings of the cults, they are seen as disposable shock troops by their superiors.
