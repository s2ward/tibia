Often encountered in caves and ruins, Bats are often seen as a bad omen. Being little stronger than a rat, they are rather a nuisance than a threat to an experienced adventurer. Their diet usually consists of small animals and their rare attacks on people mainly happen out of self-defence. Bats often form large swarms, and it is slightly more dangerous to face such a swarm than a single exemplar. Bats can be found almost everywhere as long as there is some dark place close-by where they can breed and sleep.
