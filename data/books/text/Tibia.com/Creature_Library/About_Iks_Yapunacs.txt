The Iks were an ancient civilisation of proud warriors, builders and artists long lost to the world of Tibia. Their origins lie far from the known continents, only fragments of obscure lore and cultural remains tell of their history and legacy. A great catastrophe at the evolutionary height of their society led to exile and the scattering of surviving Iks in various parts of Tibia centuries ago. The Yapunac are stronger than most of their brethren and wield sacred ceremonial gear that enhance their combat prowess. They rank as some of the highest Iks warriors in the hierarchy and can be seen as a group of ancient special forces. Now long dead and controlled by their evil benefactors, they are a seemingly unstoppable force to be reckoned with.
