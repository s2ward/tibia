The desert-creeping Cobra has become a symbol of assassination and venom throughout the world. Contrary to the slithery green snakes which dwell the swamps and in general prefer a moist surrounding, Cobras have well adapted to the dry and hostile environment of the desert. The silent killers usually prey on smaller animals and even insects, digging their bodies into a sandy dune until they are almost not visible anymore to the unaware eye. As soon as a potential victim passes by, the Cobra will perform a fast and surprising strike, injecting its highly dangerous poison into the prey. Usually only chasing for nurture, Cobras can be easily provoked or irritated and might consider any encounter a threat, fearlessly attacking everything regardless of its size. Although the tales of the fatality of its poison and its toughness are wildly exaggerated, they still pose a significant threat to all unaware wanderers and explorers.
