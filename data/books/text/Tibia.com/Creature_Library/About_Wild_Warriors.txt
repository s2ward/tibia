Wild Warriors are deserters of the Royal Army. Together with other criminals they have erected the so-called "Outlaw Camp". The king's power is too weak to reach this place, and so they feel quite safe from prosecution there. To keep up this state of lawlessness, they will attack every intruder vigorously. Equipped with heavy weapons and, due to their former training as soldiers well organised, they are quite powerful opponents.
