The so-called Cyclops Drones are the workers among the cyclops society. They are born physically different from their kin. The most prominent feature of a Cyclops Drone are its four muscular arms. They are stronger and more persistent than the ordinary cyclops, though they lack considerably on intelligence. They are usually calm, but their fellow cyclopes train and condition them in order to ensure that their passive attitude changes quickly when facing one of the 'lesser' races. Conditioned Cyclops Drones usually attack on sight. Fortunately, they hardly seem to understand what they are doing and therefore rarely use the full strength of their imposing arms. Still, the sheer force of a thoughtless blow can crush bones and break weapons and armour. Cyclops Drones are not numerous, and as they are also not much valued among the cyclops, they are usually found deep underground working under supervision of other cyclops.
