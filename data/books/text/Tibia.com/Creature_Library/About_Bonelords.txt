Bonelords are members of an ancient race that once ruled vast parts of the world. The days of this ancient glory are long gone but unlike other races of the past, the Bonelords managed to survive the decline of their power. Parts of their former power exist along with small groups or loners who took refuge in some ruins or caves. Some reluctantly allied themselves with other races or enslaved weaker creatures to do their bidding. Using bribes or threats, some overlords managed to hire Bonelords into their rank. Such 'labour contracts' are only temporary at best and chances are that a Bonelord is more concerned about plotting revenge or betrayal on its 'master' than to do his bidding.Bonelords are accomplished magicians of great intellect. The latter is rather alien to human standards and it is not easy to understand a Bonelord's motivations and philosophy. With their natural affinity to the necromantic arts, the Bonelords still claim some areas of land as their own and guard them with the help of their undead minions. They are hostile to most other races which they consider as upstarts and primitive. They fiercely defend their realms or places they claim for their own, and their interest in fresh corpses for their necromantic studies makes them a threat for each human community. Since their population grows only slowly, they envy and hate the more fertile races which, in their eyes, stole the power that rightfully belonged to the Bonelords. Seeing themselves as a superior 'conqueror race', they gather their undead forces and pursue their studies aiming at the day on which they will raise an unstoppable army of powerful undead creatures to lead them to another war to conquer the world.
