Most of the hardened desert Nomads are hospitable and honest people but some of them have become bitter due to the way they are treated by the city dwellers. Especially Ankrahmun's claim of power over the whole desert was a thorn in the side of those proud tribes. Some of them look upon the desert as their own land and don't welcome any trespassers. Others who lost their herds to famines or raids of the henchmen of the Pharaoh have turned to banditry. Be that as it may, these few Nomads have become a serious threat to the unwary traveller. They are not enough to form a raiding party of some size, but small groups of Nomad bandits can be encountered almost everywhere in the desert nowadays.
