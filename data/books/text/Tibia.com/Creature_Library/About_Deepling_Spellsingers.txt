The Deepling Spellsingers were once members of the priest caste. They were the librarians of the greatest treasure of the Deeplings - their amazingly vast knowledge and rich culture. Their turn to violence could be the result of the recent call to arms that made most members of the higher castes abandon their temples and obligations. They are also the keepers of most secrets of the forsaken Drowned Library. However, their vast knowledge of the workings of magic and the labyrinthine caves of the deep make them formidable foes who are not likely to part easily with their sacraments.
