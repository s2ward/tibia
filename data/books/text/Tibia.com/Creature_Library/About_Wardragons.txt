Wardragons are the result of Elder Dragon Nimmersatt's relentless efforts to create unstoppable engines of war. Lacking the capacity to feel fear and pain, these dragons are as unfeeling as they are relentless. They are like inexorable juggernauts on the battlefield, never swaying, never wavering. With their peculiar perception of time, they value a second in the past as much as a day in the present, rendering the concept of death meaningless to them. They relish in their great strength and sheer power. As wardragons are infertile and seem genderless, it is still an enigma how Nimmersatt is able to muster them in such great numbers. Theories are abound about a supposed wardragon queen or Nimmersatts knowledge of stashed away wardragons from the past. Wardragons are viewed as tools by their master, tools devoid of the comprehension that they are seen as disposable pawns in the grand machinations of dragons. Sometimes squads of them are deployed to just create havoc but usually they accompany other, more intelligent dragons as bodyguards or warriors.
