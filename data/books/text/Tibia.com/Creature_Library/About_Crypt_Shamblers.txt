For a long time it was believed that the Crypt Shambler was a mere myth, and even though today most scholars agree that this undead abomination exists, little else is known about it. A common theory holds that Crypt Shamblers are created from the bodies of lesser necromancers and death cultists who were turned into undead creatures while they were still alive! Although this theory remains unconfirmed, it would help to explain the burning rage that seems to be a common trait of all Crypt Shamblers. Whatever the truth, Crypt Shamblers are dangerous undead that far exceed many other undead in power and ferocity.
