Frazzlemaws are fast, fierce and above all - biting creatures. Once scented, it is not easy for a human being to escape them. Basically a ball of teeth, they have neither eyes nor ears, they are simply upon this world to feast. Their arch rivals are the equally fast and ferocious silencers. They usually avoid each other as both have strengths and weaknesses which would outmaneuvre one against the other. They share some kind of strange religion with their larger siblings, the guzzlemaws.
