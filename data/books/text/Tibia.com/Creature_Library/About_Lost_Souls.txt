Some people die in so much agony and pain that they rise again in a ghostly form. They are by far more powerful than ordinary ghosts, fuelled by the memory of those painful emotions. Roaming the place of their death, they seek revenge, not distinguishing between guilty and innocent. Usually they haunt crypts, graveyards or places of torture and great pain.Sometimes though, these Lost Souls are snatched away by demons and forced into their service by the use of magical powers. Although the demons do not consider the Lost Souls as really useful, they enjoy to have an incarnation of suffering and pain around. Some of the more powerful and cruel demons even enjoy to 'breed' such ghosts on their own. They subjugate abducted mortals and expose them to unspeakable procedures which culminate in the painful death of their victims. Sometimes a demon is able to 'harvest' one of those unfortunates out of the procedure to make an especially impressive exemplar of a Lost Soul which it can brag about to other demons.
