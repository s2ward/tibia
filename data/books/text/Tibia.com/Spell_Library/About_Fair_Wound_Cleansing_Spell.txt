One of the newest approaches of the knights guild to handle injuries completely lacks any subtlety and acquires its end by the means of brute force. This spell painfully cauterizes any wound and instantly forces mana to be converted to raw life-force. Therefore the spell is known to leave hideous scars but the knights guild has little concern for vanity and approves only usability. Though druids see this spell more as butchery than healing art, even they can't deny the efficiency of this primal approach. The immense pain that accompanies the usage of the spell is nothing for the squeamish and so the spell is only taught to veterans who have proven to be able to handle pain and injury in countless battles.
