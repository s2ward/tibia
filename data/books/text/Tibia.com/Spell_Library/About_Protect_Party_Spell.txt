One of the paladin guild's principle has always been to support and help others. So it is not astonishing that they have developed a spell that helps to protect members of their party. Every paladin who is a member of a party can cast this spell to protect their fellows. Affecting 37 squares including the one the paladin stands on, the Protect Party spell will raise the shielding by 3 for 2 minutes for every party member standing on one of these fields. Even though the spell costs extra mana for every profiting party member, the average mana costs decrease with every additional member.
