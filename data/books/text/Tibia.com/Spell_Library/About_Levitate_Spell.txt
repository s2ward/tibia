A variation of the Magic Rope spell, Levitate allows the caster to swiftly move onto suitable obstacles without having to climb stairs or to use ramps. The practical value of this spell is far greater than may be readily apparent, as large obstacles are a daily nuisance to the exploring adventurer. Besides, the spell is quite useful to make a quick escape in case of danger, as creatures usually abandon pursuit if their enemy moves onto higher terrain. When casting this spell you should not forget to add the necessary parameter "up" or "down" to specify whether you want to move upwards or downwards.
