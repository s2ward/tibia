Cowardly creatures that run away from a fight can still be brought down by a knight with the Whirlwind Throw. Just like a boomerang, this spell lets the knight fling his weapon on his enemy and then returns it to his hand. Already young knights are able to learn this useful spell. However, a knight is well advised to train his weapon skill beforehand as the damage will rise with the skill to handle the weapon he is wielding. Moreover, he should carefully consider which weapon he uses to perform this spell, as this determines the damage type he is dealing out.
