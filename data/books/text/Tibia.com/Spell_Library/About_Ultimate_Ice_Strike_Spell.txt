This spell was developed by the ice witch Yakchal herself and has made its way to the magic community through renegade ice witches that fled her mistress's wrath. It concentrates the powers of cold to a level that is even dangerous for the casters.
As the magic potential of a druid is only strong enough to master one such powerful spell, Ultimate Ice Strike and Ultimate Terra Strike share the same cooldown, before either of them can be cast again.
