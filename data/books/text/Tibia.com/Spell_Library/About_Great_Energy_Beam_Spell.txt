The Energy Beam continues to be a favourite among sorcerers. For this reason, a lot of research has gone into the spell to make it even more effective. The Great Energy Beam was the result of these endeavours. It is very similar to the original spell in appearance and in the way it is used, but its effect has been greatly improved. Of course, better performance comes with a price: The mana cost of the Great Energy Beam spell is considerably higher than that of its lesser relative.
