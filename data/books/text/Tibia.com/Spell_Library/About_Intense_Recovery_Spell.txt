This spell breaks the bound between ordinary spell casting and divine incantations. It draws heavily on the help of the gods to do its work in such efficient ways. For a while this spell was only rewarded to the most honoured followers of certain gods, but this lead to envy and corruption and so it has been made available to public as well. Though it is said that the spell will fail the unworthy, there are no verified cases of this spell malfunctioning or backfiring. It seems to work well for each and everyone that is able to cast it.
