Although this spell cannot restore as many hit points as certain other spells, it can still be considered to be the most powerful of all healing spells since its effect is not limited to a single target. Instead, every creature that is within the considerable range of effect of the caster will be healed. However, due to the large mental strain the mana cost of this spell should not be underestimated. Also, the druid should keep in mind that this spell will affect all targets, including any enemy that is within range! For this reason it is best to use the spell after combat when all opponents are slain and many members of the druid's party needs quick, effective healing.Please note that on optional PvP game worlds, this spell has no effect on wild creatures.
