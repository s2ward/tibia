Flashing lights and dark eerie thunderclouds appear in a huge area when an experienced sorcerer casts this mighty spell. Almost everybody that stands in sight of the caster will be hit by this dangerous energy spell. A sorcerer must be extremely careful when casting this spell as it happens all too often that a friend or party member is deadly hurt when the Rage of the Skies is unleashed. Not only ice dominated creatures should fear this powerful spell - an experienced sorcerer can bring down almost every enemy by speaking the magic words to call the Rage of the Skies.
As the magic potential of a sorcerer is only strong enough to master one such powerful spell, Rage of the Skies and Hell's Core share the same cooldown, before either of them can be cast again.
