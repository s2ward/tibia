The Fire Wall spell is one of the oldest known enchantments, and it has proved its worth on countless occasions. It offers reliable protection against all creatures that are afraid of fire, and many an adventurer who travels through the wilderness uses these runes to make sure he gets some undisturbed rest. The exceptionally long duration of the spell as well as the possibility to form massive barriers or even protective circles out of fire walls make this a versatile, practical spell that should not miss in any druid's or sorcerer's spellbook.Please note that on optional PvP game worlds this spell has no damaging effect on other characters, unless characters are war opponents.
