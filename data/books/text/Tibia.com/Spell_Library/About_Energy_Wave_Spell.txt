A variation of the popular Energy Beam, casting this spell causes a cone of energy to unfold in front of the caster that inflicts considerable damage to all unfortunate creatures that are hit. Due to its peculiar form it is especially useful when used in closed spaces or against fleeing enemies. Like its relative, the Energy Wave spell is not bound to a rune, requiring the sorcerer to invest mana at the point of time when it is cast. Although the cost is substantial the comparatively large area of effect and the amount of damage that is caused usually justify using the spell.
