Any newly appointed knight can learn this spell for free. It was invented by the knight's guild to provide their members with some much needed healing abilities. As the name indicates, the spell helps to clean wounds rather than to provide full healing to a seriously battered knight. Therefore, it is more of a pain relief rather than a true healing spell. Nonetheless, in extreme situations this spell can still serve as a last resource to escape death. As the spell was specifically developed for knights, it uses the limited magical potential of knights to its full extent.
