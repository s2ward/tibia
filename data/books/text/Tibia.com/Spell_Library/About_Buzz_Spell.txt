After some extensive field studies, the magic academy at Edron decided to release a slightly less powerful variant of the Energy Strike for training purposes. From the particular sound it made upon creation, it was called the 'buzz' - and it's all the buzz among apprentice sorcerers, who are specifically called upon to test its effectiveness against roaming monsters. A small bolt of lightning hits any victim standing near the caster with instant energy damage, the extent of which is determined by the caster's magic skill.
