Already Banor, the father of the first paladin Elane, had godly assistance during his battles. Until today, paladins are holy fighters who are not only skilled in distance fighting but also in the use of magic. Magic needs it to concentrate the divine powers of a paladin to a fairly good spell who is especially effective against undead creatures. If a paladin aims this spell at an opponent who is standing in a short distance, a holy light appears causing painful wounds.
