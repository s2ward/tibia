Many years and countless experiments have been necessary until the paladin guild succeeded in developing the Sharpshooter spell. Experienced paladins can cast this very useful spell to raise their distance fighting skill by 40% for 10 seconds. Still, to hit accurate with so much power, the paladin needs to slow down. So one of the spell's side-effects is that the speed of the paladin will be decreased by 70% during this time. Moreover, paladins cannot block any attacks and are unable to cast any support, supply or healing spells in these 10 seconds.
As the magic potential of a paladin is only strong enough to master one such powerful spell, Sharpshooter and Swift Foot share the same cooldown, before either of them can be cast again.
