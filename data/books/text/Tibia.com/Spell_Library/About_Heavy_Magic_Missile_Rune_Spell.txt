Heavy Magic Missile is perhaps the standard attack spell rune in Tibia. As with its lesser relative, the Light Magic Missile, this spell is bound onto blank runes which may be used up to 10 times each in order to hurl massive balls of concentrated magical energy at one or several opponents. A true classic that should not miss in any spell caster's book, Heavy Magic Missile is popular both with beginners and with masters of sorcery alike as the damage that is inflicted is largely determined by the caster's skill and experience, making this an economical, reliable attack spell. Keep in mind, however, that there are a number of creatures that are immune to the damaging effect of magical energy.
