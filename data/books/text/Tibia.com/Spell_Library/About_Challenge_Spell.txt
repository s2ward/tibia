In the heat of battle it is crucial to distract the monsters' attention from weaker party members. For this reason the knights, who are traditionally the best melee fighters in Tibia, have developed this remarkable spell. Whenever it is cast in combat, all surrounding monsters will be filled with blind rage and rush to attack the knight, forgetting their current targets. Many lives have been saved by this spell, but quite a number of knights have also paid their courage with their lives, so make sure you are strong enough to meet those you challenge by casting this spell. The sage Eremo teaches this spell to elite knights, who are exceptionally strong in close combat and thus predestined for using it.
