The research into earth spells has a venerable tradition among druids, and over the centuries a number of corresponding spells have been devised. Not all of them are as deadly as this spell. Wrath of Nature represents the ultimate achievement of this research and is now the most powerful earth damage spell in the druid's arsenal. Whenever it is cast a huge cloud of grass and soil combined with the powers of Mother Nature hits any creature that is unfortunate enough to stand close enough to the caster. Only the immunity to earth damage will allow a victim to survive the effects of this powerful attack. All druids who are thinking about using this spell should be careful though, because of its massive range of effect and its substantial mana cost.
As the magic potential of a druid is only strong enough to master one such powerful spell, Wrath of Nature and Eternal Winter share the same cooldown, before either of them can be cast again.
