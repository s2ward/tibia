This spell was developed by druids for the specific purpose of studying wild life from within, as it were. Although they succeeded in devising an enchantment that allows the caster to take on the physical form of nearly any animate creature, the spell was in fact a failure because the metamorphosis is strictly limited to optical effects. Taking apart the appearance, the caster remains normal in any other aspect, and no special abilities such as flying or breathing fire are attained. Consequently, few creatures are fooled by Creature Illusion. However, the spell is far from superfluous, as it allows for some terrific effects on Halloween.
