Being aware of the own body and its functions, the caster can assert a certain amount of body function controls that are usually beyond conscious control. Using this awareness, it is possible to force gaping wounds to close and to stop any blood loss immediately. This necessary and often life-saving spell was derived from more powerful healing spells and condensed to an energy-saving, to the point healing that addresses the all too common danger of bleeding to death.
