This spell is actually a reversal of the well-known Cure Poison spell. By 'reverse engineering' this spell and analysing its components, the researches of the Noodles Academy came up with this poisonous variant. As expected it works contrary to the Cure Poison spell and inflicts a powerful poison upon its victim.
