Like the name says, this spell represents the ultimate achievement in illuminating magic. After centuries of painstaking research the wizards at Edron's magic academy have finally succeeded both in extending the Great Light spell's duration and its intensity to create a whole new enchantment that is almost literally capable of turning night into day. Except for those creatures that possess the uncanny ability to turn themselves invisible, no evil creature should ever be able to catch you by surprise if you have cast Ultimate Light.
