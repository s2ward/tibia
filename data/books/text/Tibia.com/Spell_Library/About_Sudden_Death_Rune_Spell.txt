The name of this spell and the ominous skull and crossbones on the runes say it all. Fast and deadly, the sorcerers' widespread reputation of gruesome efficiency in combat is largely based on this devastating spell. Nearly no other spell can compare to Sudden Death when it comes to sheer damage. For this reason it is immensely popular despite the fact that only a single target is affected. In fact, most sorcerers and druids and quite a number of skilled paladins always have a couple of Sudden Death runes in their backpacks in case of an unexpected ambush. However, a wary adventurer will not blindly rely on his Sudden Death runes to save him in any position. Since the damage caused by the rune is of deadly nature, it is less useful against most undead creatures.
Due to the enormous power that is bond to this strong rune, it can only be used by players who have experience level 45.
