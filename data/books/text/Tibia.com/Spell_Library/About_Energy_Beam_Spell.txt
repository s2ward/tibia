The Energy Beam was one of the first instant attack spells to be devised. Its development sprang from the need to allow for quick offensive magic that did not rely on the use of runes. The result of this endeavour was this handy spell which is capable of dealing massive damage in the blink of an eye. On casting this spell, a ray of concentrated energy is shot in the direction the caster is facing, electrifying everything in its way. A clever sorcerer will use this spell in narrow passageways where his opponents have no choice but to line up.
