The modern research of new found sources of power, like the secrets of exaltation, have led to parallel breakthroughs in magical traditions. Ignoring the heated discussion who was first to channel the purest power of their area of expertise, it can be said that all traditions came up with their results almost simultaneously. Probably due to the general knowledge that the other guilds were experimenting on that matter, a competitive race to reach that goal first had started. In the end the result was the creation of an avatar empowerment by each of the guilds.
By focusing on their spiritual purity, experienced paladins learned to focus the holy light into their own bodies.
Over the course exploring his own devotion the paladin creates a projection of his ideal self into the core of his soul.
When a paladin channels this devotion he actually switches places with this ideal form and his physical body is engulfed in his own soul, while his consciousness inhabits the holy projection which becomes physical.
