Wielding raw elemental forces, the caster calls down a concentration of destructive elemental energy engulfing the victim with fire. This spell was the logical extension of the commonly known spell of destructive fire magic. While prior spells suffered from the amount of control a caster had to put into shaping the effect, this spell in the contrary embraces the uncontrollable aspects of fire. This makes the spell highly capable to destroy things, although not always reliable. Some scientists warn about the possibility to accidentally create an unstable but permanent rift to the elemental realm of fire by using this spell but this notion is usually waved aside as only a theoretical side-note by their colleagues.
