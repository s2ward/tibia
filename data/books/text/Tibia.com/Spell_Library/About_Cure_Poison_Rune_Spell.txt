In the old days, when the world was still young and people did not know the dangers of the wild, many adventurers fell prey to poisonous creatures that were roaming the caves and forests. The druids, who were skilled with all kinds of poisons, wanted to help those young adventurers that were not able to cure themselves. After many years of research they finally succeeded in altering the cure poison spell so it could be bound to a rune. By using this rune it was possible to stop the effect of any known poison.Ever since then, the trusty cure poison rune has saved the life of many a poisoned adventurer who found he had run out of mana just when he needed it most.
