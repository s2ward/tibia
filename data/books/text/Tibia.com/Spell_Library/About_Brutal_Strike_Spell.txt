This ability has been taught by renegade Mooh'Tah masters and is based on focusing one's inner strength into a single overpowering blow. It takes a great deal of training in meditation as well as in various combat techniques. The inner power is suddenly and often surprisingly unleashed into a forceful blow that uses the body's momentum and the combatant's concentration to achieve a maximum effect.
