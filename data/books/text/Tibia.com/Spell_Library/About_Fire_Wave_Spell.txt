This was one of the very first spells ever to be created. Impressed by the destructive power of dragon fire, some of the foremost sorcerers agreed to cooperate in order to develop a spell that would resemble the magical flames both in spatial extent and in destructive potential. The result was an instant spell that causes streams of searing fire to shoot from the caster's hand which unfold into massive cones as they go along. While the fire created this way never really matched its model in its sheer destructive effect, the spell is still capable of wreaking havoc among those that are hit, especially if the caster manages to direct the fire wave right into the middle of a group of enemies. However, the caster should be careful not use this spell too liberally in order to avoid serious mana drain.
