A cunning combination of the Fireball and Fire Field spells, this rune is a deadly weapon in the hands of the skilled user. On releasing it an area of 9 square metres is covered by searing flames that will scorch all those that are unfortunate enough to be caught in them. Worse, many monsters are confused by the unexpected blaze, and with a bit of luck a caster will even manage to trap his opponents by using the spell. However, caution is needed since most of the more determined monsters or creatures will not be held back by the flames for long.Some daring adventurers are known to have used Fire Bomb runes onto themselves in desperate situations to keep their enemies from attacking them. However, for obvious reasons only the strongest or most desperate adventurers should use fire bombs this way.Please note that on optional PvP game worlds this spell has no damaging effect on other characters, unless characters are war opponents.
