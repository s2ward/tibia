In certain situations, such as the final stage of a fight, it can be very useful to have an extremely powerful attack. For this reason, some clever mages have developed a spell that allows a knight to raise his weapon skills to 135% for 10 seconds. During this time, the knight is in a Blood Rage that gives him incredible attack power but lets him completely neglect his defence, and so he is unable to block any attacks in this condition and suffers additional 15% of damage.
A knight is versatile and can alter quickly between an aggressive stance and a defensive stance by casting Protector to remove Blood Rage.
