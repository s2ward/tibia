With this spell, researchers made the breakthrough in storing holy energy in runes. However, only paladins can control this holy power. For this reason, only paladins can fill up blank runes with 5 charges of holy energy, and only paladins can unleash the energy from such runes to hit the opponent with a forceful strike of holy power. The paladin's opponent will be struck by a huge holy cross that causes a good amount of damage and is especially useful in fights against all undead.
