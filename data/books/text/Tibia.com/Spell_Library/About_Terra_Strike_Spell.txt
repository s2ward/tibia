When a caster is yelling the formula of this spell, the aimed opponent gets not seldom a horrified look at his face. A huge plant with enormous teeth seems to appear out of thin air trying to devour the unlucky being with neck and crop. Particularly against energy dominated creatures this spell can be deadly in the hands of an experienced sorcerer or druid. However, this spell is also popular among young magicians as it requires only little mana and offers a reliable, instantaneous performance.
