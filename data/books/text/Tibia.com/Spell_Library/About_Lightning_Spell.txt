Calling upon elemental forces, the caster calls down a powerful lightning to strike his enemies down. This spell is a classic that has been rediscovered only recently. It passed out of use in the years of the great rain that made its usage extremely dangerous even for the caster. The modern version has been modified successfully and now works even under water.
