After facing the challenges of Zarganash the development of this spell was somewhat of a low hanging fruit. Several accomplished sorcerers developed this spell almost simultaneously with little variation. In the end the Noodles Academy gathered the different versions of the spell, streamlined and optimized it and released it to the public. At first elemental energies that sorcerers are used to wield are broken down into their more basic and unspecific components, which mimics their corruption while bypassing a real tainting effect to the caster. Then it uses this raw negative energy to reduce the damage that a creature is able to deal. Though sorcerers were eager to adapt this new spell, it was found out that the splicing of elemental forces needs a certain finesse that only comes with practice and experience.
