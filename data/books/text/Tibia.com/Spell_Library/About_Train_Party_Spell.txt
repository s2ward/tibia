When being in a party, knights are able to share one of their greatest talent with their party members. The weapon skills of the knight and all members standing on one of 36 fields surrounding him when casting will be raised by 3 for 2 minutes. The knight's long training hours are reflected in this spell that uses the powerful magical energy that develops at places with several joined adventurers. Even though the spell costs extra mana for every profiting party member, the average mana costs decrease with every additional member.
