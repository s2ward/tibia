By activating hidden inner reserves, this spell attempts continuously to bring back the body into a harmonic state without any wounds. Increasing the self-healing of the body considerably, the recipient gains enormous regenerative powers. This spell was derived from gruesome experiments with certain regenerative creatures by a cabal of necromancers. When the cabal was finally destroyed, also most of their blasphemous researches were destroyed. It was decided, though, that ignoring this helpful spell would be a disregard of the suffering of those who died for the creation of this spell.
