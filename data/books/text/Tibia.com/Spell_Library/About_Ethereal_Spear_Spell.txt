Every paladin is kind of lost when he runs out of ammunition. For this reason, a spell was developed which might save the life of a paladin in a risky situation. When the formula of the Ethereal Spear spell is spoken, a magic spear is created by the sheer willpower of the caster and shoot on the selected opponent. The power of this attack will rise with the paladin's skill to handle distance weapons.
