Food plays a crucial role in Tibia, as both the healing of wounds and the regeneration of mana require a well-filled stomach. In fact, many a daring adventurer who ventured deep into some dreary dungeon lost his life because he forgot to bring along food. However, with this handy spell in your book you never need to worry, even if you are shipwrecked on a deserted island or stuck in a lightless cave. Simply cast Food and you will receive one or two random delicacies that will help you carry on.
