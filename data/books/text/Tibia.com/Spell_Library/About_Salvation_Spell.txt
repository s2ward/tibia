Only those Paladins who achieved the highest level of sanctification are granted salvation by their god. With the cleansing of mind comes a cleansing of the body, healing even severe wounds. Salvation is the most effective and strongest healing spell a paladin has at his disposal. Still, it should be used wisely as the rather high amount of required mana does not allow an unlimited use of it.
