A last resort to any young paladin in a tight corner who has run out of arrows, this spell will conjure up three arrows to ward off the worst until you have reached a safer spot and can resupply. This spell was invented after much discussion between the high paladins who deemed it useful that even their paladins-in-training would have a little ace up their sleeves, but thought that granting them the Conjure Arrow spell would be overdoing it at that early stage of paladinhood.
