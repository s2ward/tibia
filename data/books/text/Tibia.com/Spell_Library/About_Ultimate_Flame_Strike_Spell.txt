This is actually a summon spell that willingly sacrifices a specific creature. As the experiments to summon the powerful hellfire fighters led to no success, it was tried to utilize at least some of the results in some form. This led to the creation of this spell with which one can summon an unstable form of an hellfire fighter that spontaneously explodes into a fiery burst.
As the magic potential of a sorcerer is only strong enough to master one such powerful spell, Ultimate Flame Strike and Ultimate Energy Strike share the same cooldown, before either of them can be cast again.
