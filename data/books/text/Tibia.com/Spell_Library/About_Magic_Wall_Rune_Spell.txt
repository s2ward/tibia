This spell causes all particles that are contained in the surrounding air to quickly gather and contract until a solid wall is formed that covers one full square metre. The wall that is formed that way is impenetrable to any missiles or to light and no creature or character can walk through it. However, the wall will only last for a couple of seconds before it evaporates just as though it had never existed. It is always a good idea to have a magic wall rune or two in your backpack in case you are chased by a monster you just cannot hope to defeat.
On open PvP game world, magic walls can also be yellowish. The yellow tone appears to all characters who are not in a PvP situation with the casting character. Characters can simply walk through these yellowish walls.
On optional PvP game worlds, magic walls are mostly yellowish and will collapse if somebody walks on a field with a magic wall. The only exception are magic walls cast by one of your opponents if you are involved in a guild war. These magic walls will last just as long as on other game world types, or until somebody who is not a war opponent of the casting character walks against it.
