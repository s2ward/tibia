One of the standard field runes, this spell creates a limited barrier made up of crackling energy that will cause electrical damage to all those passing through. Since there are few creatures that are immune to the harmful effects of energy this spell is not to be underestimated. In fact, rather than using the rune to block narrow passageways, many of the more inexperienced Tibians use it as a cheap offensive spell, since affected creatures suffer energy damage at least twice.Please note that on optional PvP game worlds this spell has no damaging effect on other characters, unless characters are war opponents.
