Casting this spell generates a solid wall made up of magical energy. Walls made this way surpass any other magically created obstacle in width, so they are recommended for use in outside areas where there are powerful monsters to run away from. For this reason it is always a good idea to have an Energy Wall rune or two in one's pocket when travelling through the wilderness. However, recent studies have suggested that there may be some creatures that are capable of breaking through energy walls, so you should always be prepared for a quick escape just in case.Please note that on optional PvP game worlds this spell has no damaging effect on other characters, unless characters are war opponents.
