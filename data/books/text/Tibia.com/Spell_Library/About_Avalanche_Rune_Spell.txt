The Avalanche rune rolls over its victims just like its name giver. It is just as cold as an icicle rune but with up to 37 squares it affects a much greater area. The ice damage which arises from this rune is a useful weapon in every battle but it comes in particularly handy if you fight against a horde of creatures dominated by the element fire. Once it is released, everybody standing near the rune user will feel the gruesome pain this freezing magic is causing. This rune is popular among all vocations even though only druids are able to fill empty magical stones with this powerful spell.
