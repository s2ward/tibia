At a certain point of expertise an experienced druid is so much in harmony with the elements, that he can just ask them to do his bidding.
Though other traditions object such views, the druids vehemently insist on their interpretation.
Following their reasoning the elements are ever-present at any place where things exists. It is the druids view, that they just gently nudge this ever-present forces to awake and to assist them.
Reaching a point where such feats are possible is a tedious and long process but the true druids find it even more rewarding and natural that way.
They learn to harness such forces along with the flow of nature's power through their surroundings and themselves.
This necessary attunement is seen as a natural evolution and leaves behind the artificial burdens and restrictions that human existence imposes on them.
As the shackles of the unnatural fall, the power of harmony grows within the druid.
The manifestation of such powers can come in different ways, according to the druid's wishes.
The usage of such powers in form of several burst spells is a rather mundane incarnation of the things such an attunement is capable of.
