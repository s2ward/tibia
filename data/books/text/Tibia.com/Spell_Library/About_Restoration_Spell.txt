Concerned with the growing threats to the world, the normally reclusive druids lately gathered in what they call a 'ting'. There they not only discussed the state of the worlds and shared experiences, but also actively worked on improvement of their arts. Over time the traditional tings had developed into endless debates that only the elderly attended and that more often than not ended in bickering about pointless interpretation of ancient lore. In modern days the tings are invigorated and see the attendance of some of the brightest minds of druidhood. For the first time in centuries constructive progression was pushed and this powerful healing spell is one of the most potent results.
