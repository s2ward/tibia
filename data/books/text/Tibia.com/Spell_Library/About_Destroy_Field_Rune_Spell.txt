In the world of Tibia, magical fields are a common threat. Not only do many adventurers have the possibility to use field runes, but there are also a number of other conceivable causes, including traps, breath attacks by certain creatures and even perfectly natural occurrences. To be trapped by such harmful fields is an unpleasant experience most seasoned adventurers have had at some point or other. Many of them simply owe their survival to having had a couple of Destroy Field runes with them! A truly indispensable spell, this rune should not miss in any adventurer's backpack.
