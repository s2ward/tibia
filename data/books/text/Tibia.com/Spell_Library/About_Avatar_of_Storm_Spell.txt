The modern research of new found sources of power, like the secrets of exaltation, have led to parallel breakthroughs in magical traditions. Ignoring the heated discussion who was first to channel the purest power of their area of expertise, it can be said that all traditions came up with their results almost simultaneously. Probably due to the general knowledge that the other guilds were experimenting on that matter, a competitive race to reach that goal first had started. In the end the result was the creation of an avatar empowerment by each of the guilds.
The transformation into an Avatar of Storm is an offshoot of alchemical research to transform lead to gold. While being unsuccessful, the experiments yielded several side results that had little to do with their original intention but have proven worthwhile nonetheless.
In this case one of the results was a potion, that in itself seemed of little effect. Yet prolonged exposure makes a body highly reactive to the channelling of elemental powers.
By usage of said potions over time and the simple usage of elemental spells, a sorcerer attunes his body more and more to the elements.
If the attunement has reached a certain point, it's relatively easy for the disciplined mind of a sorcerer to channel said elements through his living body like using a complicated yet controllable spell from his spell book.
The sole problem is the amount of strain such a transformation puts on a caster and maintaining it for too long lead the first users to explode in spectacular manner.
Since it is sorcery work, in a formulaic way, it was easy to put several restrictions into the formula and create a powerful and manageable spell that puts the caster into minimal danger.
