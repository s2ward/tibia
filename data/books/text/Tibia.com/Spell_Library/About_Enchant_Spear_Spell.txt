Spears are especially popular among young paladins. To make spears more attractive also for more experienced distance fighters, Tibia's most talented paladins set together and developed the Enchant Spear spell with which regular spears can be greatly improved. To cast this useful spell, the paladin needs to have a spear in his inventory and speak the right formula. The spear will fill up with magic now. Such an Enchanted Spear does not only have more power, but it is also much more durable than a regular spear.
