The Light Magic Missile spell is usually the first attack rune spell to be found in a beginner's spellbook. By casting it onto a blank rune in his hand, the caster will create a beautiful green rune that can be used up to ten times against an opponent. The Light Magic Missile itself is an energy blast that will cause moderate damage on the target.
Spell casters usually abandon this spell as soon as they are capable of creating the more powerful Heavy Magic Missile runes. However, as the damage caused by the rune is determined by the skill of its user, the Light Magic Missile rune can cause surprising damage in the hands of an expert caster.
