The Explosion rune is somewhat unusual. It must be aimed at areas rather than at specific creatures, so it is possible for explosions to be unleashed even if no targets are close at all. For this reason the effective use of the rune requires some skill. Thankfully, however, explosions cause damage within a substantial blast radius, so the experienced adventurer will know when and how to use this spell to achieve optimal results. In spite of its tricky handling Explosion is still an immensely popular spell as it deals considerable physical damage and because it is the most powerful attack spell druids can bind into runes.
