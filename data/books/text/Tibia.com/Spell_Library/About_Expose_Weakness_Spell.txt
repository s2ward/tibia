This spell is a side effect of the failed attempts to create a spell to counter Zarganash's draining effects and curses. While it proved to be too difficult to create a reliable shielding, the knowledge about the draining energies enabled the creation of this spell that somewhat mimics their effects. Sorcerers all over the known worlds embraced the new spell, though cautious voices warned about its untested nature, possible side effects and long term consequences of its continuous usage. Still some caution is applied and the spell is taught only to more experienced casters that are left on their own to decide when or where to apply this potentially dangerous spell, to make enemies more vulnerable to their attacks.
