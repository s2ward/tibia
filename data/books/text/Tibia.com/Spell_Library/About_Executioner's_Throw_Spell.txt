Albeit knights relying on close combat, the need of means to have an answer to attacks from distance fighters made it evident, that even a knight has need for a more diverse arsenal of abilities at his disposal. The endeavour to find such has led to several more or less effective techniques, with most of them shunned for their lack of effectiveness and impact. This changed with the development of the Executioner's Throw. Even the earliest incarnations of this technique showed great promise and many of the finest knights took effort in honing and perfecting this skill.
In our days the Executioner's Throw is becoming a difficult to learn but greatly prized ability that has earned its place in the array of skills that a true knight has to possess to be recognized as equal amongst its peers.
