The modern research of new found sources of power, like the secrets of exaltation, have led to parallel breakthroughs in magical traditions. Ignoring the heated discussion who was first to channel the purest power of their area of expertise, it can be said that all traditions came up with their results almost simultaneously. Probably due to the general knowledge that the other guilds were experimenting on that matter, a competitive race to reach that goal first had started. In the end the result was the creation of an avatar empowerment by each of the guilds.
The Avatar of Steel is a form that needs some sort of self-control that has to develop over a long period of time. Eventually a knight that can steel his will can connect to an individual patron entity, which is believed to be one of the partly ascended followers of Banor. By channelling the force of their patron into their body, the knight physically transforms into a colossus of steel and embodiment of war. This state puts a heavy toll on even the most experienced knight. The first attempts often left the practitioners stuck in immobile metallic forms without any sentience. Even the more refined versions of the spell left the user with metallic marks like iron fingernails. The modern version of the spell fixed those problems, aside from a neglectable few occasions in which the spell causes the wielder's hair to stand up and turn to solid gold.
