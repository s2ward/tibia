Just recently, a group of druids finished a long-term research to develop a new spell that allows a druid to improve the regeneration ability for a certain period of time. However, only in a party, the druid has enough magical energy to cast this spell that will increase the regeneration speed to 20 hit points every 2 seconds for a period of 2 minutes. However, the spell can only boost an already running regeneration, so adventurers with an empty stomach will not profit from this spell. This spell can be cast on an area of 37 squares including the one the casting druid is standing on. Even though the spell costs extra mana for every profiting party member, the average mana costs decrease with every additional member.
