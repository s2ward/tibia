Life in Tibia is dangerous, and all adventurers must live with the disquieting certainty that the next fight may be their last. For this reason the crafty sorcerers and druids are constantly looking for new ways to assist the Tibian heroes and to guarantee their survival. This spell was one of the more uncommon solutions they have found. Starting from the thought that to survive a battle means to live to fight another day, the researchers developed it to help adventurers to escape from fights they cannot win. Using their excellent medical and anatomical knowledge, the druids found a way to magically generate powerful adrenaline rushes which allow the caster to perform superhuman feats for short periods of time, allowing them to outrun most common creatures. It has to be said that some reckless sorcerers proposed a different approach which was actually based on the manipulation of time itself. This approach, however, was quickly dismissed by the wise council at Edron's magic academy, since it posed imponderable risks. Unfortunately, however, these studies were carried on in secrecy. Later on, they led to the creation of the more powerful, but dangerously unstable Strong Haste spell.
