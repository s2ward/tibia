The foreigners have taken us by surprise. They used evil magic to overcome our men and we finally had to retreat. If the mighty Yakchal had not been in her regenerative sleep at this moment, we would have beaten them for sure. But to make matters worse, the holy coffin, in which Yakchal is sleeping, has been stolen during this attack. Our scout reported they have dragged it into the mines. They probably plan to use its powers for their own purpose. The good thing is that it won't open at all as long as it is not touched by starlight. The bad thing is without starlight Yakchal might be trapped in the coffin eternally.
