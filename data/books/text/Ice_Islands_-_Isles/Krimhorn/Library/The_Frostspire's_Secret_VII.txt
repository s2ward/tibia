... figured out at least some of the secrets of the ancient artefact I have found. Its purpose was to focus the power of some other structure, probably the destroyed frostheart spire. However, the shards of the frostheart, which can be found in this land, seem to have enough power remaining to fuel the powers of the sarcophagus. At least I was able to unlock the healing and restoring abilities of the artefact. The annoying part is the function of the sarcophagus itself. I put much effort in figuring out how to open it. It seems that starlight is the key! The sarcophagus is easily accessible by starlight. At sunrise it seals itself and only opens again when the stars brighten the sky. Since my first tries in some dark ice cave, the sarcophagus won't open at all of course. My first experiments with the sarcophagus left me with a claustrophobic feeling. What if a cover of snow makes the sarcophagus inaccessible while I am inside? I will have to trust my apprentice to see that I am freed in such a case. It's a good thing my vain apprentice is very concerned about conserving her youth and beauty. For this reason, she has a vital interest in opening and accessing the sarcophagus on a regular basis. Still there is a slight risk, but that's a risk a scientist like me has to take I suppose.
