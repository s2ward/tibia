Hard to believe but those miners from Carlin did actually something useful for my research. Through my apprentice I learned that their mining uncovered ancient caves and passages in the ice. They also found strange creatures frozen in ice. That creatures could either be the ancients themselves, that got trapped in the ice, or remnants of the invading demon army that laid siege to the frostspire.
My apprentice gets restless more and more. Her lust for power is as disgusting as her body is alluring. Both have little importance for a man of science like me though. Let her be occupied with her petty struggle with those druids on Nibelor. As long as her followers bring us a sufficient amount of shards, I don't care about her private plans. I have to get a better access to the mines. Any confrontation with Carlin authorities, backed up by the druids there, would cripple my researches. There has to be some other way.
What a waste of time! I remember a quite exotic ritual I've learned in my youth from a lizard snakecharmer that I'd captured in the Tiquanda jungle years ago. Although the idea to modify it is ingenious, it will take an incredible amount of time to prepare a complete and useful ritual. In the meantime, I heavily rely on the help of my apprentice.
