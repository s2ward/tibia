I think my apprentice is up to something. Probably a raid on Svargrond or even Nibelor or something foolish like that. After all those years, I know this little scheming snake well enough to smell that something is cooking.
The ritual of binding gets closer. It's hard to believe another seven years have passed. As soon as I have recovered enough strength from casting another spell to lure the sea serpents, I will have to get rid of my apprentice. I almost feel some melancholy after all those years but it has to be done. I probably just freeze her for some decades until I have finished my researches and leave this isle. Then she might become the queen of all her barbarians and kill the druids on Nibelor or die trying. I don't care.
