Things are going smooth and well for me. I was able to investigate the mines and caves. It seems that most creatures that are frozen in the ice are part of the demon army that fought the ancients. To my surprise, some of the demons are quite alive when they are freed from the ice. So I had to kill a handful of them. Unfortunately, now my barbarian helpers are too scared and won't enter the mines anymore. It is no great loss though. As far as I can tell, there are no significant shards hidden in the ice and I have no use for any rampaging demons. The chances to discover one of the ancients dead or even alive, are slim at best. Most likely, the majority of demons were frozen in ice at that moment the frostspire shattered. It is highly unlikely that any of the ancients was amongst them at that time. So after verifying some of the myth behind the frostspire, I could return to my actual work. The secrets of the shards will be mine, now that all distractions are eliminated.
I am a bit absorbed in my studies. Everything else does not matter. I have spent more than two lifetimes in investigations of the shards. My results so far are amazing, though of little practical value. But it already raised the boundaries of my perspective of magic as a whole. My apprentice is growing more and more restless. She demands more knowledge, more power, more of everything. If I would not need her to maintain things here, I'd get rid of her one way or the other. But the way things are now, I have to live with this nuisance. I have no time to teach her new tricks. She knows enough to impress and frighten her superstitious people. I don't care about her fight with the people of Nibelor. I will not allow her to provoke a war that will further hinder my studies. There has been enough delay already.
