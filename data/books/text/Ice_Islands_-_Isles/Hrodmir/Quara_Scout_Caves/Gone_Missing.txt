Two days now that I fell into this cave, and still no help from the base. Did they not notice my gone missing? Surely the others were able to reach the camp and tell of our findings in the ice? I hope that my notes will not be lost and that someone found my satchel with the shards, and can make something out of it. ... Three days now, and food for maybe one other day. It is cold, and I can barely hold the stylus. ... I believe I am not alone. I see strange things moving, behind the walls. Am I hallucinating? Maybe there is a way through to somewhere else, somewhere warm, if I could only break the ice. But my sword broke trying to reach the strange glitter and movement, and I am without hope.
