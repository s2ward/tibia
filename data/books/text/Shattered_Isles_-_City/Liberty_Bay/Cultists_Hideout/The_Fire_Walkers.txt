The Fire Walkers
On one of the isles I witnessed an utmost unusual occurrence. The natives gathered to some festivity. After some singing, dancing and drinking, they started to jump through some of the bonfires. They started screaming insanely and then started to walk over glowing logs of wood. I am wondering if this has something to do with the stuff they are drinking. It would be interesting to see if it can be used to cross lava streams.
