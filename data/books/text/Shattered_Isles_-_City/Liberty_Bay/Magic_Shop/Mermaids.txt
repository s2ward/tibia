Mermaids are vain creatures of magical nature. Dealings with mermaids are dangerous to some extent. Many men have fallen in love with one of them, bewitched by their beauty and magic. Fortunately, mermaids are easily distracted and lose any interest in their enthralled victims as soon as something or someone else draws the attention. Since this is often enough another man that was foolish enough to get close to them, one elflock-stricken victim is replaced with another one. It is almost impossible to escape this vicious circle since unbanning one victim often means to sacrifice another man's live or at least his freedom.
