Diary of Shawn Risjaw...

finally reached Port Hope. The settlement's name is quite suitable - for me at least. It is my last hope to avoid that assassin Ned Noxious. It said that the old red master himself has trained him. There is no doubt that I am no match for him in a fight. I can only hope he will lose my track somewhere in Thais or Carlin. I will head to the nearby mountains to look for a hiding place there.
The gods are with me! Not only did I find some sort of cave, but also a fourth raid covered my disappearance from the town. Now I have to manage to live here for a few years in a hideout, then I might return to the town. I have yet to explore the caves fully. They seem quite huge and I can only hope that I am not running out of luck. I do not want to imagine what would happen to me if I run into some hostile inhabitants here. Still I think my skills are sufficient to handle some cave bears or even some tarantulas. If I run into a giant spider, I might have a problem though. My supply of runes is not large enough that I could spend them needlessly.
