The Lighthouse in the Middle of Nowhere
Sailors claim to have travelled as far as the end of the world where the water pours down into nothingness. Although it is easily recognizable during daylight it poses a special threat at night. To make matters worse, a spooky lighthouse sometimes appears out of nowhere to lure ships over the edge of the world. Whether it is really a lighthouse or some other source of light differs from story to story and remains to be determined.
