The Quara, Curse of the Seas
No one knows where they really come from. It seems the murderous quara are living deep down in the ocean in unknown numbers. From there, they plot their raids on the surface in which they cause havoc and mayhem. The quara consist of several subspecies whose relation to each other is still unknown to men. Given their hostile disposition, it is unlikely that we will ever learn more about them. For most humans it is sufficient to know that a quara means danger. Those who are able to fight them should kill them, those who are too weak should avoid them by all means.
