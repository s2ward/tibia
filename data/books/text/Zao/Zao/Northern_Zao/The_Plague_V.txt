With the orcish hordes in our lands, many of my colleagues have recalled their troops from the borders and patrol duties to fortify their cities. Only me and a few others still maintain some form of patrols. It seems that due to the lack of resistance, the orcs roam quite freely in our lands. Ironically the calling back of troops seems to have brought the plague into the fortresses. So the reinforcement actually turned into weakening the positions. When the emperor learns about this, I am sure some heads will roll. Without any force to restrict them, hordes of infected peasants flee their villages and spread the plague further. From all what I can tell, the plague has spread everywhere by now and even the fortresses are no longer safe. I think once the orcs retreat, we will have a big task of rebuilding at hand. With the obvious failure of certain governors, I will gain more power and influence. Perhaps I can even convince the emperor to merge some of the bordering provinces with mine.
