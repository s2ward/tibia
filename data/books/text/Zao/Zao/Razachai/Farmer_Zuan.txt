The farmer Zuan was found guilty of heresy for speaking bad words about a spawn of the great snake that has crossed his field. He was sentenced to death and his tongue was cut out. The tongue will not be given a proper burial but will be thrown into the sea. The village has to pay the temple 20 sacks of their finest rice as compensation. Praised be the great snake.
