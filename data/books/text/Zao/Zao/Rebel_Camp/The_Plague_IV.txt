I have been informed by the local governors of the north that they will not be able to send any additional troops to help out with our orc problem. They claim that the diseased are threatening to invade their fortresses in the hope of finding some cure or nourishment there. Therefore, they need every men at their disposal. I will gather the local guards that are now on their way to stop the spread of the plague by burning infected villages and join them with my remaining soldiers. Considering our might and expertise, the orcish raiders are of course no threat. I will take the rejection of support as an opportunity to prove my superior strategical and logistical skills. There has not been any glorious battle for decades. Even though I fear that the reports of panicked peasants exaggerate the number of the orcs, there is still hope that they will be enough to give my soldiers some exercise. The captain of the local border patrol has remained silent for quite a while now. I assume he is still figuring out how to explain that he had let slip some of the orcs. I will not accept the decimation of his ranks due to the plague as an excuse. The plague is something we all have to deal with. It is even possible that one of my rivals has paid him for his inattention in the hope to disrupt my control of my province in these hard times. I think it will be the wisest decision to have said captain executed as soon as I have dealt with the orcs.
