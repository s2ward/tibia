Rabaz' Unabridged Almanach Of Botany
----------------------------
First Edition
Rabaz, Farmine
An unfinished passage of the almanach reads:
'Dreadcoil': Probably the most salient out of the manifold variations of plants befallen by corruption in Zao. (...) Strangely deformed but majestically developed, often aculeate. Blind. It twines constantly to find and catch small insects and even pollen foreign to the species. (...) those found in dry regions or steppes (often underground) are corrupted but still physiognomically intact and ideal for gathering samples. (#133, D, very rare, no sample)
'Giant Verminous': These mutations of various common deciduous trees are usually quite high. Leaves and branches are generally bound upwards (periwinkle, non-weeping) which makes them nearly impossible to gather. (...) some specimens grow subterranean (broad crown, tendriled treetop) and should be easier to reach. Typical locations are dry and secure from animals. (#137, A, very rare, no sample)
