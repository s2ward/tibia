Letter to the Guild
Today the other masons, woodworkers and the smith were to gather in the lower quarters posthaste. The task at hand being for us to take care of a remodelling of the complete northern wing in the basement: they want stables. Neither did they explain to us what they are needed for nor why we should scurry the process in such manner. It's an island for crying out loud! I demand a better explanation, without the exact purpose these stables may not be suited for what ever they want to put in there. I am hereby requesting additional help in the negotiation of this matter with the Order.
With regards,
(illegible)
