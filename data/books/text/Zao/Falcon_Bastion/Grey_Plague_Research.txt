Druid's note.
Our Grand Commander has ordered me to do more research on the Grey Plague. Books, experiments, studying, learning - it takes time. Time we do not have. We need to hurry up but within reason. What Oberon wants me to do is nothing short of superstition. I am to conduct ancient rites, rituals. Spells older than most things you see around you in this world today. I refused when I was asked to start rummaging in the entrails of a being I could not even classify. It seems they caught a type of lizard and want me to dissect it. Not to simply see its inner workings, no - to use its blood and bowels to conduct another ritual, a dark and spell directly drawing from blood and reeking of pure evil! No more. I know that our honourable order wants to find a cure to this and that Oberon can get quite 'persistent'. But this is just not what I was made for. I literally can't perform it, my hands are shaking and I am seeing the most vivid images of demons and devilish trickery. I handed my research over to the Preceptor, knowing that Lazare will handle this issue with utmost caution. May he be the better man. Oh I know I have have failed, my flesh is weak.
