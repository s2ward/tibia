Message to the honorable Grand Chaplain Gaunder,
we need to find a way to actually tame one of these dragons. If we cannot manage to make them follow our bidding, we will not be able to harness their power in full and in turn never get to the bottom of this whole issue. You know how Dominus treated me the last time I was n't able to carry out his orders from him which, if I may, where a bit out of proportion-even for him. If this happens again, I will hold you personally responsible. Make them squeal, use brute force or ask the Preceptor for one of his twisted spells from him, I do n't care as long as I'll be able to make it "Sit!" right after your treatment.

Grand Commander Soeren
