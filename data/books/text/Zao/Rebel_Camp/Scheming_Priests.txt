The few remaining priests of the great snake try to gather some form of resistance to overthrow the new rulers. I was never a religious lizard. With my grandfather being a geomancer, my family followed older teachings about spirits and ancestors and did not feel that the fanaticism that most followers of the snake god displayed was appropriate. I even doubted some of their essential doctrines and I remember tales from the dawn of time that made no reference to a great snake at all. Yet, those priests might be our last hope to get rid of the new rulers. The priests did not like my independence in the past, though, and I am not sure if I am welcome in their ranks. Together we might stand a chance.
