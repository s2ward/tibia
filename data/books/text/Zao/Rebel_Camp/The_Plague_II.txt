Only parts of the military are willing to support us. Their spirit was broken long ago in the fights against the orcs. Our once proud army was reduced to an inflexible behemoth that reacted sluggish to any problem. And this behemoth was beaten into shambles by the orcish hordes. Only the dragons' interference turned the tides of war. Now most generals fear what would happen if this support were withdrawn. Could we repel another attack of the orcs? Would a civil war not only make us more vulnerable with no winner at all? I fully understand and share these views. Still, it is our only hope. If we bow to the dragons now, they will rule us once and for all. We have to act here and now. Yet, I am afraid not many will join us and the temptation to betray our cause for some better position in the hierarchy is a constant danger. Our best hope is to form a resistance in secret and then strike at the dragon kings at once. None of them shall survive and we have to avoid fighting other parts of the army. We must save every strength that is left for the time ahead, for a time when the dragon kings are gone. With a beheading strike we will free our nation.
