On my journey back from the south, I have seen that this so-called plague has struck many of the villages on our way. It is hard to tell so, who is infected by the plague and who is not because none of these disgusting peasants seem to watch his health properly. I wonder how they waste their food rations, given how gaunt and shabby some of the uninfected looked. Also, they do not seem to be too interested in hygiene after a day on their fields, they seem to prefer the privacy of their cottages instead of taking a bath. They are so uneducated and silly it shivers me. They surely need our guidance. If you ever ask yourself what makes us nobility, then all you have to do is visit one of those villages and you'll see it at first glance.
