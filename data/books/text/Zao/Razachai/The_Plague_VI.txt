The plague is not much different from those we have encountered before. In fact in ancient texts I found a report of an occurrence some generations ago with almost identical symptoms. The plague of these times was only local. The village was put under quarantine and the best physicians and supplies were sent. Over the course of a month, the plague had passed through and from over 100 infected less then 20 had died. It seems the plague in our days was ignored by the authorities for quite a while. Later a local governor tried to cover up this mistake and kept the plague secret. To ensure that, he chose a rather aggressive approach and had the village burnt down with all its inhabitants. It seems that some of the villagers had escaped though and fled to relatives in neighbouring villages. As the word of the extermination of the village spread, many peasants fled their villages as soon as the first symptoms of the plague showed up. Still, it seems the plague is hitting the peasantry harder than it had in the past. I think I will have to investigate their living conditions to get a better insight.
