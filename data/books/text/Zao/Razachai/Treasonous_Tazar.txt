The governor Tazar was found guilty of treason in three cases and was executed at sundown. He was found guilty to have withhold money from the local taxes to fund a rather dubious private army of mercenaries. Secondly, he had used said mercenaries to sabotage the property of a neighbouring governor. Further, he was found guilty of belonging to a cabal of three governors of his family line that planned to assassinate the emperor and to replace his house in regency. His belongings were confiscated and his family was dispossessed, his co-conspirators were arrested.
