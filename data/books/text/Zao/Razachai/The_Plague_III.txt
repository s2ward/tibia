The treatment of sick peasants has lost more and more importance in the recent years. The local governors have grown accustomed to rather shunt infected people into the provinces of their rivals than to pay for their treatment. People are cheap and plenty, medication is not. As a physician I cannot agree to such an attitude, but I am in the employ of a governor and have little influence on his decisions, and even less on those of others. The nobility in turn values its health quite much. Even the most minor symptoms have to be treated with the most expensive and powerful potions at our disposal.
