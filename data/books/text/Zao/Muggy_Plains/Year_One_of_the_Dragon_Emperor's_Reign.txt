This is year one of the dragon emperor. Today the great dragon was crowned emperor over all Zao, the land and its people. It was a most magnificent and spectacular ceremony. I would disgrace the moment if I tried to describe it. How it looked, how it felt just cannot be described to someone who was not present himself. I am still deeply moved by the ceremony. Now the wise dragons have finally taken the places of dignity they deserve in our society. Their wisdom and leadership will lead our realm to new heights of civilization and prosperity.
