This is a letter to a woman who is referred to as Uquora the High-Handed. It seems to be a report about the activities of the group that has occupied this old masonry. The group calls itself the "Circle of the Black Sphinx". The letter's author also reports that one of the local leaders, Lady Tenebris, obviously has turned against the circle. He is writing about so-called broken shapers whom she is using for her own ends, sending them against her former comrades.
