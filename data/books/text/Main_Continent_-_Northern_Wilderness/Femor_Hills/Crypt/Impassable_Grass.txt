<you recognize a torn diary of some sort>
... Now I have the information I needed so much. It cost me a fortune, but my 
love is with it. The evil Minz hid my beloved Caramellia in a tower in the femur
hills, I will travel ...
... almost killed me but i made it to the tower. Sadly the druid enchanted the 
area with some nature-magic and the grass is almost impassable ...
... met a wandering elf and bought a machete. Now I will be able ...
... not possible! I am not trained enough to cut the fast growing grass away 
quick enough to clear a path to the tower ...
... will hide for the night in a nearby cave I have spotted this morning while 
passing by and will tomorrow travel to the town to improve my grass-cutting-skill.
I am sure if I am more familiar with that I will make it!
