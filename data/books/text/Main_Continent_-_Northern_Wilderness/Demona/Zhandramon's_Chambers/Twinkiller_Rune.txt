Dear Gelunidas,
I request that you send me the twinkiller-rune I ordered some months ago immediately. If I am convinced that they work as promised I will order them in greater numbers. They might be handy in my next schemes. As this letter should show you, the tales of my death are wildly exagerated. I hope you and your warlock brethren did not think you get off the hook that easy? If you don't work on the stuff I ordered and I do not receive the stuff I ordered in time, be prepared for a visit. You won't like my new friends that I would introduce to you.
