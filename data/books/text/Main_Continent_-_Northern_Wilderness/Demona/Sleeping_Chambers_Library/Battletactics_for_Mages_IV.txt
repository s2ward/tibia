Battletactics for Mages [IV]
by Zun Su
*The last Book of Zun Su's famous Battletactics for Mages deals with the combination of field runes, offensiv runes and spontanous spells (both offensive and defensiv). All known spells which could (at least theoretically) be learnt by a mage are listed at the end of the book.*
