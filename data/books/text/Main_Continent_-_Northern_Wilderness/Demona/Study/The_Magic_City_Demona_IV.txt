The magic city Demona
Written by Danae, historian of the warlocks
Part4
Wild monsters and human adventurers found the tunnel from Demona to the surface and tried to conquer our city.
Only with much luck and under many casualties we could defend our city.
But what was to do now? We had to go to the surface but we must somehow protect our city from enemies.
We had many ideas. But the best was to create a giant maze. We would know the right way but our enemies would have to search for months and maybe they would starve or go back to the surface and never come back.
So the works on the maze began.
