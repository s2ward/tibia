The magic city Demona
Written by Danae, historian of the warlocks
Part1
We dont know exactly when this city was build.
But it must have been centuries ago.
I have collected the few information we have from the past and tried to reconstruate the birth of this city:
Our ancients used their mighty magical power to control the lava down here. With the help of our loyal trolls, they somehow build this city.
A city only for serving one goal: The investigation of the magic in our world Tibia!
