The magic city Demona
Written by Danae, historian of the warlocks
Part2
Our world of Tibia is filled with various kinds of magic. Until now, we dont know much about this magic. Only a small part of the whole magic power is under our control.
Our goal is to research into the magic web of our world and to control it, so we can finally reach our purpose: the immortality.
But before we could start with the research, our ancients had many problems to solve.
