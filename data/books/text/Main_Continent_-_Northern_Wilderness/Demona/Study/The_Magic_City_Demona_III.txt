The magic city Demona
Written by Danae, historian of the warlocks
Part3
In the beginning, our ancients lived in total isolation. They thought, that they can survive down here without any contact to the outside world.
But after some years they realised that they cant cast enough food and water for all warlocks.
They also realised, that it was necessary to be under the free sky to cast some spells (Like the spell "Path of the Stars", that only works if the caster can see the stars in the night).
So they made a direct tunnel to the surface.
All seem to work well. But after some years new problems appeared.
