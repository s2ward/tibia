A teleportation through the magic web
Written by Zuania
I was one of the first who was allowed to teleport through the magic web.
I could easily open the gate with the power of my will. But after I was in the magic web I lost control. So I came out near Carlin although I wanted to come out near the east gate of Thais.
All others made the same experience.
It went all so quickly when I was in the magic web. I could only see a red light and some other gates far away for some seconds. And then I was already in Carlin.
Maybe one day we can just teleport into the magic web and stay there. I would love to investigate it.
