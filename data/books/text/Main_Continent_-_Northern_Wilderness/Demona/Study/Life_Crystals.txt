Information about the life crystals
Written by Doneos
Our ancients killed some dragons and suprisely the dragons carried some life crystals with them.
They researched into it and found out, that the life crystals obtain the same kind of magic that the life rings have.
But there is a slight difference:
The power of the life crystals seem to be ten times bigger then the power of the life rings.
Thats why the life crystals glow a little (you can see it in the night) and life rings not.
We couldnt solve its secret yet, but one day we will.
