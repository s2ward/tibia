The magic city Demona
Written by Danae, historian of the warlocks
Part5
With our mighty magic abilities and the help of our new friends, a tribe of trolls, we could create the maze within one month!
After it was finished nearly nobody found out the way to our city. The few who found it were killed by us.
We hired some mercenaries too. We pay them good for protecting parts of the maze against enemies.
And thats how is was for centuries until today.
We could make our researches in silence and without fear of an attack.
One day we will reach our main goal. And then we wont have to fear anyone.
