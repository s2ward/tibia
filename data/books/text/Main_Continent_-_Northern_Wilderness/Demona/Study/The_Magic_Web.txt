The magic web around our world
Written by Heronias
For centuries we have been doing research into this magic web in our world of Tibia. And the more we try to understand how it works the more I think that we will never solve its mysteries.
But we havent give up hope yet. Maybe we will find somehow someday by chance a key element that will help us to open many doors in the magic web.
Until then we will keep on trying to solve as many riddles as we can.
