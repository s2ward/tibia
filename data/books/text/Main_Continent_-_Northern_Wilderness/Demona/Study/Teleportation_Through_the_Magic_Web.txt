The research into the teleportation through the magic web.
Written by Notigeus
We used a part of the honeminas formula
to open some special doors in the magic web.
Those special doors have the ability to teleport the caster to any part of our world. We tried it a few times and we succeded.
Though we must be very careful because the teleportation through the magic web is very dangerous.
Unfortunately, we arent able to control the destination doors. So we can only teleport into random areas. And this could end deadly.
Until we know more, every teleport is forbidden.
