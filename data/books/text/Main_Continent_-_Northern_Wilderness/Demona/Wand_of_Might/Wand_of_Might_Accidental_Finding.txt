Sortaje Auterius!
Yesterday it happened something strange that I must report you.
While I was studying the magic powers of the talons I accidently dropped one talon to the ground.
It rolled over to the lava and fell into it.....
And then suddenly the wand of might began to glow....
For 5 minutes the wand spread a mighty aura and then it suddenly stopped.
I will investigate this....
Yours,
Tardimen
