Legends about the wand of might.
Written by Herion
This book is about the origin of the wand of might.
First of all I want to say that nobody is sure who made it and how it was made. But it contains a powerful magic energy of unknown kind.
Since we lost most books written by our ancients we cant say how the ancients got the wand in their hands.
However, we are very happy that we own it because it helped us and it will help us to understand the magic web around Tibia.
For example, only with its help we could find the gates of teleportation of the magic web.
We are making right now some experiments with several magic stuff and we hope that the wand of might will react to some of them somehow.
