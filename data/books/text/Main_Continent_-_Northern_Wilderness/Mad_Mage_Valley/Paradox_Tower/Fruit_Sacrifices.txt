I will become a GOD! YES A GOD!
I will be a better god then the others!
Those who whorship me will have to make sacrifies for me! Yes, they will have to!
What will I ask for? Not much, perhaps food. But i'd be a good god so I only accept plants. No! Better fruits! I love fruits! They have to sacrifice a melon for instance. Oh and then a banana!! But I love cherrys too! So they have to bring them too, yes yes!
Then they have to invoke a ritual, involving an apple, and and and ... grapes! Grapes are important! Yes indeed! And for the last sacrifice I demand a coconut from my faithfull. Only then they are allowed to ascend to my throne! Oh, yes what a joy for them!
