Report 34DFOO12
We still cannot figure out who or what caused the disappearance of Oliver Holmes. Aforesaid mage from the Noodles Academy of Magic Arts came here to study the different cultures of the area. After three days of preparation and planning, his room was found empty. His bed was unused but his clothes lay neatly folded on a chair as if he had undressed. There were no signs of a fight and the door had been locked from within. It is a complete mystery why or how he disappeared.
