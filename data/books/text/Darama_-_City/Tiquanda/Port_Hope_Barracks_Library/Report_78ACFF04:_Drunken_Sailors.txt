Report 78ACFF04
The usual turmoil when the QUEEN GENOVEVA is in town - the sailors, drunk as always, stood out with their usual misbehaviour with the result that one of them spilled the beer of a local dwarf. In the following fight a lot of property was destroyed and even lives were endangered. I sent word to Thais that such events destroy the peace of our colony and that we would probably do better to rely on the more disciplined seamen of Venore who are more accustomed to the hardships of long journeys than the men of the Thaian marine. A letter written by the local traders strongly supporting my point has been enclosed.
