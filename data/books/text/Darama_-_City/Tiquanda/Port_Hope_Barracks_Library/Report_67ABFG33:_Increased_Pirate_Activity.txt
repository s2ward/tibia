Report 67ABFG33
Captains report an increased activity of pirates on the routes from Port Hope to Thais and Venore. I support the traders' demand that the king should intervene. A well armed warship with some experienced fighters would not only secure the routes, but also boost our line of defence in Port Hope. With their support we could fight back such enemies like the ape men - or even capture Trapwood, an area rich in bamboo that is populated by those murderous dworcs.
