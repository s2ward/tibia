The respectable mage Borsoz was able to provide us with a cure for the so-called 'jungle fever'. People repeatedly reported some kind of 'out-of-body experience'. While sleeping, they suddenly stood beside their own body and watched over it. The magician proved that the 'fever' actually was caused by a small bug. This bug injects a mildly toxic hallucinogen into the body of a sleeping person causing the mentioned phenomenon. Borsoz developed a paste that, when applied to the walls and the floor, keeps those bugs away. All settlers were provided with the paste and the "fever" has been efficiently eradicated.
