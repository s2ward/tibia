The Lizard People
It seems the lizards we encountered in the jungle are some sort of civilised culture. When I speak of culture, I relate them only to primitive orcs and minotaurs of course. During our expeditions to the jungle we learned that they are hostile to humanity like most of the vile creatures of this new land. Their animosity also spreads to most other races we encountered here. They seem to be a warlike race, searching for conflicts and fights with each and everyone they encounter. Obviously this mindless aggression leaves little room to develop a culture like the human one, achieved due to a long history. It is unlikely those primitive brutes even know the very concept of history at all.
This leaves one to wonder who supplies them with their exotic weaponary and armor. Perhaps they are some minor race of a greater dark power that lurks in the deepest depths of the jungle. The magic I have seen performed by those lizards was far from impressive. They use a very limited variety of shamanistic tricks that are insignificantly more powerful than the powers those average orcish hive shamans hold.
To sum things up, the lizard people are another hostile race that might be seen as a hindrance for humankind but they do not pose a threat. On the other hand they are of no use to us and a timely elimination could only be helpful.
