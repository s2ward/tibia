Wondrous Plant Life - Jungle Edition Vol. 1
(In memory of Mandol the priest - Sadly this work was left unfinished due to his untimely end by a carnivorous plant.)
The threadlike vegetation of the thread tree can easily be cut off and, if woven with moderate skills, can be used to make ropes. These ropes are especially useful when it comes to simple constructions that only have to last for a short period of time.
The jungle dweller bush is quite a common plant. It's the home of a variety of insects and small animals.
The green wig bush is mainly known for its long, threadlike roots. Although those roots are edible it is not advisable to actually do so. They have an extreme bitter taste and need to be boiled to reach an edible state. The green wig bush got his name from the sad fact that sometimes the murderous dworcs use its roots to bind them to their heads as some kind of camouflage during their sneak attacks.
The lizards tongue is quite an unremarkable plant. It grows quickly but there is no real use for this resource and it does not please the eye enough to be worth growing it. It can be easily recognised by the slimy coating of its leaves which partly led to its name.
The jungle crown is somewhat rare. Still it's quite an unremarkable plant considering its majestic name which probably originates from its unique ringlike growth pattern.
It is unknown if the name of the green fountain bush was chosen deliberately or rather accidentally, but the name is well to the point for two reasons. Firstly, it does indeed resemble a frozen green fountain and secondly, like a cactus it is able to accumulate a substantial supply of water in its thick leaves.
