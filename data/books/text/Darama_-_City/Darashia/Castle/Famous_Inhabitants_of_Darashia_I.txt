<You have found this very old book that seems out of place among the other books.
As you leaf through the yellowed pages you see the description of a person on each left side and the painted portrait of this person on the right side. One person catches your attention. Not only does he have an inappropriate title, also his appearance is strange - on the one hand, he looks friendly, almost funny - on the other hand, his eyes seem to look directly into your soul. Eye-catching is the amulet he is wearing. You read the following and feel very uncomfortable with the portrait staring at you. You tear out those two pages and take them with you after having made sure nobody is watching you.>
