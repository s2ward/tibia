The Godbreaker
Though the only sources of information about this artifact are the confessions of demons who were tortured by power-hungry demonologists, the number of different and independent sources alone grant them some kind of validity. The godbreaker seems to be some kind of myth amongst demon kind, forbidden lore even to them only to be breathed under the threat of death. It may very well be that the whole story is a lie told to demons to raise their morale, as there is no hint whatsoever to give the stories some form of cogency. The godbreaker, according to demon legends, was created at the dawn of time. It may have been a weapon used by Zathroth to kill Tibiasula, but most sources claim it was created much later, in the most heated phase of the godwars by Zathroth's own raging son, to kill his godly opponents once and for all; but then it was taken away by Zathroth and imbued with incredible enchantments and magics, never dared to be used before or later. It is said that Zathroth himself was amazed and scared by the outcome: a weapon so dreadful that even a god could not look upon it for a longer time. Zathroth ultimately deemed the weapon too strong, particularly fearing that his other half, Uman, might get hold of it and take revenge for the murder of Tibiasula. So Zathroth broke the weapon into numerous parts (most stories claim seven, others name three, four or even thirteen parts). He hid the parts at places so remote and so dangerous they never could be reclaimed by someone other than him. Should the forces of darkness ever have to fear defeat at the hands of their opponents, Zathroth would reforge the godbreaker and vanquish his enemies. Sometimes it is said he entrusted the Ruthless Seven with guarding the parts.
Some stories even go so far to tell that Zathroth used the broken parts to create the Ruthless Seven with them, and that their unified power might be enough to kill a god.
