The Akh'rah Uthun is the unity of that which cannot be united. The flawed Akh, which is our anchor to this mundane world, is generally weak. By giving in to the needs of the physical Akh, the Rah and the Uthun become enslaved to this world, even though their potential is such that they could transcend the physical world. However, the greatest flaw the Akh suffers from is its mortality. Why should we seek to satisfy its puny needs and its trivial urges if we know it is doomed to die? Yet this is how the Akh holds our spirit captive. It slowly poisons both the Rah as well as the Uthun.
