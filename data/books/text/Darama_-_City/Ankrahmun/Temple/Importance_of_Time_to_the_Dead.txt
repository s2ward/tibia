Time is of no importance to the dead. To understand the concept of time is to understand the cruel trick the gods played on all mortals. Just because it pleased them to do so they stripped all living creatures of their immortality, thus turning anything they hope to achieve into futile ambition. For what is left to hope for if you know the sands of time are moving relentlessly in your hourglass, and that death will be the end of all? Whatever a mortal can hope to achieve time will take from him eventually, and all his hardships and his glorious achievements will be just a distant memory in an indifferent world.
