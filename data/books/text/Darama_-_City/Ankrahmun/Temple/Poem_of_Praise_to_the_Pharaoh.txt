By the powers that remain and the powers of old,
by the wisdom of the scarab and the kiss of the scorpion,
by the infinity of the sand and the eternity of the mountains,
by the life-giving powers of water and air,
by the death-bringing powers of fire and lightning,
by the blessing of death and the revelations of undeath,
this corpse shall rise from the grave,
this corpse shall break the shackles of life,
this corpse shall seek wisdom,
this corpse shall serve the one.
Praised be our pharaoh!
