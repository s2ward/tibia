...so Margathla revealed him one of the secrets he guarded. A secret long thought to be forgotten. And so he forged the parts of the mask and assembled it on the demonic altar he secretly built in the centre of the complex beneath the great pyramid that was supposed to become the final resting place of his father. The magic of the altar was that strong, that its power could fuse the parts to become the famous helmet of the ancients, when they even came close to it. He crafted eight helmets for him and his allies. His own helmet was imbued with the eternal power of a soul ruby, but his co-conspirators had to rely on ordinary rubies to obtain at least a fraction of the power of their master's helmet. Each of them was granted the secret to forge a single part of the helmet. Arkhothep knew they would never share their knowledge with each other and their greed would lead them to diffuse their energies to plot against each other instead of working against him.
