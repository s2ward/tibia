The secret of the high mask of the ancients was thought to be lost in time forever. But with the coming of the undying pharaoh its secrets were snatched away from the scarabs and the sands. Once more, masks were forged that contained the secret energies of lost aeons. Their true powers remained a mystery, but from the little that showed at first glance it was clear that they were most powerful indeed. Unfortunately, the pharaoh decreed that their powers were not meant for ordinary mortals, and ordered them to be destroyed. It is said that it was necessary to combine the powers of different ancient idols in order to create those legendary artifacts.
