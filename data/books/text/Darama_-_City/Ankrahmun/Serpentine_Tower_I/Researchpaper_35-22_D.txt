Researchpaper 35-22 D
The 'Foeburner' spell still is not working. Somehow it seems impossible to specify a group of targets to be excluded from the area of the spell effect. If only we found a way to use a spell or a spell-like ability to define non-target groups we could finally make the spell work. For now, however, we have stopped the research because we felt it is necessary to create the groundwork for future research in the field. The question is: Should we focus on working out a special definition spell, or is it actually possible to weave some sort of divination spell into the pattern of the foeburner in order to receive a satisfying result with a single spell. I am somewhat inclined towards the latter option because of the satisfactory results we have recently achieved in the field of divination magic.
