In ancient tombs beneath the burning endless sands
Where neither sunlight reaches nor the pale-faced moon
The whispers of the long deceased traitors dance
Bloodthirsty creatures screeching an unholy tune
Dark are the mysteries surrounded by doomed cries
Uncurtained to the warriors of righteous mind
Who well-prepared with magic, sharpened blade and eyes
Step through the doors and leave their mortal fear behind.
