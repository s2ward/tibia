The Klabautermen
The klabautermen are a race of impish, mischievous beings that live on ships. Using invisibility and other magic, they remain unseen most of the time. But be warned, if you antagonise the klabauterman of a ship, his harmless pranks will turn dangerous.
In general it is a smart move to keep your klabauterman happy with little presents
and a lot of rum.
