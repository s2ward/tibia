The Witches' Grotto
On a remote isle in the South there is a grotto where all witches come together to celebrate some demonic festivity once a year. They teach each other new malicious tricks to torment other beings. The legend goes that everybody that dares to disturb them is put to death or faces a fate even worse than death. But if you manage to step into their dancing circle at the height of the ceremony, the witches have to fulfil you a wish.
