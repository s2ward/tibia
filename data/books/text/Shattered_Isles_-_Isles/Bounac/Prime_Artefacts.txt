Prime Artefacts (Donated to the royal library of Bounac by the venerable knight and scholar Galthen)

Among the many magical items I came across during my travels, there were a few extraordinary specimens. Of all the bizarre magical creations only a handful would cause instant harm and even fewer corrupted body and mind in a manner that was not reversible or could be countered with spells or proper gadgetry. However, some were of a peculiar malevolence, not just charged with wickedness but "made" of chaos. According to my experience, there is no such thing as good or evil. Those are relative terms, derived from human evaluation and expectations. Based on the moral compass of individuals, rather than facts and meticulous research as dictated by a proper academic approach.
There are destructive forces in place in this world that can be harnessed to create impressive relics of might. Some artefacts, however, are rather pure and seem to originate from a time and space even before the world as we know it even came to existence. I dedicated my life's work to finding and neutralizing these artifacts which I call "prime artefacts". Their origin or purpose is unknown, their power to distort and corrupt is unfathomable. Yet I am convinced that the ultimate consequence of their influence is purely destructive.
