CARNISYLVANS, Classification and Treatise (Donated to the royal library of Bounac by the venerable knight and scholar Galthen)

An introduction to my findings in regards to previously undiscovered tree-like creatures:
A frightening, frankly shocking fact was revealed to me during studies, based on the discovery of the remains of a dead, tree-like creature recently. A new species I first described and classified as "carnisylvan", an organic mammal, sentient and intelligent but belonging to the realm of beasts. However, as a catastrophic result to arcane influence, Carnisylvans should rather be described as humans, who have undergone a severe but incomplete metamorphosis.
They are inherently human and are probably conscious. What little I could gather from the condition, my specimen was in, There was also human tissue and it had distinctive human features such as teeth, fingers and a familiar, if drastically twisted, bone structure.
As I continue my studies on what caused this weird condition, I will take the remains to the academy in Edron for further examination.
