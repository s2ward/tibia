Treasures of the Southern Isles
Quite a few pirates hoarded up treasures in the past. It is known that pirates tend to hide their treasures on deserted islands for some unknown reason. They just bury them on some remote place and then forget about them. This similarity to the behaviour of squirrels was never scientifically verified. However, since pirates love to dress lightly they also love the south. Therefore, it is only natural that they hide their treasures there. Some of the southern isles are so popular among pirates that there is hardly any free space left to bury new treasure.
If anyone ever is looking for treasures, then those isles are the best place to start with.
