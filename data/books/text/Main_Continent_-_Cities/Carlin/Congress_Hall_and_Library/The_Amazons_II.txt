The Amazons Vol.2
However, the threat posed by mercenaries loomed over Carlin for some years and the city was never fully able to disband the standing army. The core of the army was formed by the scouts and a city guard. This army was to be reinforced by a highly trained militia in times of need. Through many years, this militia became an effective force, so effective in fact, that as its reputation spread, those soldiers of fortune who may have been tempted to attack a city run by women decided they would be better off seeking their wealth elsewhere. Thus, the need for an army declined, and the cost of maintaining a standing army became too much of a burden for a city which was striving to become a major force in trading.
The army was therefore disbanded, and it was expected of the women that they return to their former occupations. This did not please many of them, who felt that they were being cast off and neglected and accused the Queen and her advisors of being short sighted and ignorant of the dangers to their city. When they failed to find support from the Queen they abandoned the city, setting up outposts in the woods to protect the militant way of life to which they had become accustomed.
Several years had passed after the death of Bella Bonecrusher, the valiant warrior who had roused the womenfolk of Carlin to protect themselves against the orcs, when the future direction of the army became a focal point for political conflict within the court of Carlin. Several conflicting groups jostled to influence the Queen in order to follow their own agendas, attempting to manipulate the army, its size, its composition and its aims for the furtherance of their own interests.
