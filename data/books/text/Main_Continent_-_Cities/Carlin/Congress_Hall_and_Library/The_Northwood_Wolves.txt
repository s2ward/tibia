The Northwood Wolves
The woods north of Carlin were home to numerous wild beasts. Packs of wolves were only one part of the fearsome fauna inhabiting the forests. So when sheep and cattle disappeared, no-one paid too much attention. Hunters were sent and they killed some of the wolves, however, the numbers of livestock stolen did not reduce. However, it was when humans fell victims to the wolf attacks that people turned to the Queen for aid. The conclave of druids, however, intervened and prevented the people from hunting down and killing every last wolf. They promised to take care of the problem themselves. Four of their most knowledgable beastlords were charged with the task of ending the threat. Only one returned, wide-eyed with fear and unable to speak coherently of what he had seen. And now, the true reign of terror began - whole farmsteads were attacked and their inhabitants torn apart and devoured. The druids organised a force of hunters and spellcasters. They fought their way through the woods, facing packs of wolves who seemed to be fighting as organised forces with an almost human intelligence. Despite winning the battle they failed to win the war and the ultimate source of the evil controlling the wolves, and more people fell victim to the wolves' attacks. The following winter a blood smeared adolescent was found, wandering aimlessly through the woods. His name was Charles Farmer. Shaking and half mad, those who found him were able to piece together his confession. He claimed he had killed his mother with a silver candelebra to make the wolf in her stop doing evil things. The boy was given over to the care of the druids, who took him in and protected him and the community from his madness. After this incident, the attacks on the farms and killings in Northwood ceased from one day to the next.
