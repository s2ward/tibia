Knight Brave: At last we meet face-to-face!
Doctor Darkness: Too late, puny knight. You can't stop my master plan anymore!
1st Knave: Watch out! It's a trap!
Knight Brave: Don't quail, my faithful follower! We have mastered worse obstacles to get here!
Doctor Darkness: Haha! You may not fear for your own life, but how about hers!?
2nd Knave: Oh no! Look! It's Princess Buttercup! He's holding her hostage!
Doctor Darkness: Indeed I do! Wouldn't it be a pity for such a beautiful young lady to die so tragically?
Princess Buttercup: Don't care about me! Save the world!
Doctor Darkness: Keep quiet! Else your hair will make the acquaintance of these scissors!
All: You're such a monster!
Doctor Darkness: Hahaha! Now drop your weapons or else...
1st Knave: Never!
2nd Knave: But what about the princess?
Knight Brave: Trust me, my loyal minions. Drop your weapons.
Doctor Darkness: At last! The brave Knight Brave in my hands! Your death is near!
Knight Brave: Not that fast, Doctor Dumbness!
Doctor Darkness: How dare you? Are you mad? I hold the princess hostage and you drop your weapons. You're all lost!
Knight Brave: I don't think so, dear doctor!
1st Knave: What's this? Behind the doctor?
2nd Knave: Look! It's Lucky, the wonder dog!
Lucky: Woof! Woof!
Doctor Darkness: Noooooo!
Knight Brave: Get him, boy!
Lucky: Grrr!
Doctor Darkness: Ahhhhhh!
All: Hooray!
Knight Brave: Lucky, once again you saved the day!
Lucky: Woof!
