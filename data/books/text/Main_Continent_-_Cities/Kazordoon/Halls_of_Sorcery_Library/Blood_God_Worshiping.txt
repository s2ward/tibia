In ancient times, a god of blood was revered by a cult of fanatical followers. This cult was said to have performed gruesome blood rituals and sacrifices to appease their deity and gain access to its immense power. Some sources claim that this god of blood was responsible for creating the first vampires, imbuing them with his own power and granting them immortality. Others suggest that the cult's rituals were simply an attempt to emulate the power of the blood god, rather than a direct channeling of his power. Regardless of the truth, the cult eventually fell out of favor and its practices were suppressed by the ruling powers of the time. Yet, whispers still persist of secret blood cults that venerate the blood god and seek to tap into its otherworldly power.
