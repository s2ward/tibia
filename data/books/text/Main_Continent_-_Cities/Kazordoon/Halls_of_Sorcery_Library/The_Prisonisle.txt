The Prisonisle
Most of the rebelious dwarves who betrayed us and allied themselves with the cyclopses and some dishonorfull human knights were prosecuted and thrown in jail on the prisonisle Dwacatra. They now have to live or fight the captured Minotaurs, Orcs, and Cyclopses they seem to like that much.
Justice is served.
