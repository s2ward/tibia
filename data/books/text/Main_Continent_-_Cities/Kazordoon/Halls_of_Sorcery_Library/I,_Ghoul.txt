I, GHOUL
By Himhor
Within this obscure essay lies a remarkable study of a dwarf who poses as a ghoul to view what life is like from the Ghoulish point of view. A particular emphasis of the work is the fascinating ghoulish healing habits, which the author presumes to be, unlike many warriors thinks nowadays, an effective romantic ritual which ghouls aims to the creatures they do found appealing somehow.
