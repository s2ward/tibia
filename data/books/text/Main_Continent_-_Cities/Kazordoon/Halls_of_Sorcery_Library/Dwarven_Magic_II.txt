Dwarven Magic II
By Marokin
Floatation
This spell will one day allow any dwarf that may not be a good swimmer the ability to almost walk on water. What we found out you would probably need are the remains of a slain stone golem, the branch of a willow, the wing of a wasp, and a flask full of slime. Pour the slime into a cold cauldron and add in the other ingrediants into the cauldron and boil it. This seems to be the base of a powerful potion, though the finalization and the spells needed to enchant it are still a riddle to be solved.
