Dear diary,
this nice ol' woman brought us some fine beer.
I guess its ok to help her with this apple mailing service she wants to start. If only this human girl would shut up. We all regret to have granted her hospitality. This gal has the appetite of a rotworm and if ye' don't watch her every second she'll drinks all our beer and starts throwing things and demanding for some 'prince'.
