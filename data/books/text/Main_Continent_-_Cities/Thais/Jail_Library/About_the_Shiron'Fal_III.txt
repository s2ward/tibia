The information that could be gathered about the legion is rather meagre.
In Rathleton one of the Shiron'Fal agents unleashed one of its minions, a mummy called the Ravager, to cover his tracks.
The individual itself could not be identified but several sources refer to him as a 'death priest'.
This, in tandem with his mummy minion, might hint at someone with powerful necromantic abilities, possibly with ties to Urgith.
He seems to have been looking for an artifact of corrupting powers with some relation to blood.
It seems that said artifact was not recovered or was not existent at all.
For all we know the death priest retreated with empty hands though this might be a ruse.
As recommended agents were deployed to look further into the rumours about said artifact.
Parts of the ravager could be acquired for further studies.
