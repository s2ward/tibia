The individual that was researching vampire lore and especially the whereabouts of possible vampires or their remains was NOT acting on behalf of the inquisition. In the light of warnings about some shadow organisation that is known as "army of the grave" and other similar names, it has to be assumed said person might have been one of their agents. Even more so, since all of a sudden this person, using the name Luthgar Decars, switched subjects of his research. His new agenda seemed to be to learn about famous knights of the past and lore about their time. Since it seems unlikely, that all of those knights were cursed with vampirism, the sudden change of fields of interest seems odd. Even more since this person used forged documents to access restricted information. It seems likely that this person had malevolent intentions.
