Only the most pious are allowed to join our ranks. The churches support the inquisition in their efforts to get rid of heretics that try to undermine our society. They are an illness and we are the cure. If we don't cut off the rotten parts, the illness will spread and eventually contaminate us all. If someone joins our ranks, he will start off as an investigator. He will have to prove his worthiness by diligent work and pious deeds. He will have to face traitors and monsters and kill them.
