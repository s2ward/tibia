Rewar the bloody was a petty man of intrigue with the aspiration to become king. Through manipulation and deception he acquired a great deal of power. To raise his status he claimed several heroic deeds of others as his own. Though he silenced anyone who could put his exploits into question, suspicions amongst his knightly peers begun to rise. When he claimed the dragon slaying by a shepherd, who was assumed to have died in the fight, as his own, another knight confronted him with a wounded but alive shepherd and called his bluff. Rewar, seemingly infuriated, demanded a trial by combat, thinking that he would easily best a mere herder of sheep, unskilled in the use of arms. When he learned that not the shepherd but the accusing knight would be his opponent he fled the court the night before the trial and hid in a remote castle at the border. There he lead a life as a robber baron for a while until a force of the realm drove him out. He became a traveller, visiting many wonders of the known world and beyond. He served as a sword for hire for some time, but serving did not suit him well and he abandoned his employers often in the time of greatest peril. Often he did so, with a good part of the employers wealth. Some he betrayed for gold, others out of spite. With his reputation ruined his traveling intensified. As an old man he returned to the realm and bought himself a pardon by a young, new king with his ill-gotten wealth. While a few old knights who remembered him and his misdeeds tried to put him on trial again, through intrigue and bribery he dogged their accusations until he finally died of old age.
