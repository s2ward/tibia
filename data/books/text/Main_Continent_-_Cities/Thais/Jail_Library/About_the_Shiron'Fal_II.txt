The assumption that the organisation Shiron'Fal had a hand in the exposure and ultimately destruction of two members of the triangle of terror seems rather unlikely. The effective elimination of the cabal had only strengthened the ruthless seven. There is no clue why they should assist a probably rivalling faction. It is by far more likely, that said exposure was orchestrated by the seven or by their last remaining member Zoralurk. It seems proven, however, that 'someone' had been acquiring assets that formerly belonged to the fallen demons. Though here also Zoralurk and one or more of the seven are likely suspects, it is still entirely possible but unlikely, that another party - namely the Shiron'Fal - was involved. Who ultimately managed to acquire an advantage in this matter is entirely unknown, though.
