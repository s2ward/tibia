After the rise of mankind the Shiron'Fal was founded by envious members of more ancient races, like the elves, dwarfs and minotaurs, to sabotage humanity's gods given ascension to power. From poisoning of wells to assassination of key members of human society, this shadow organisation did anything petty and spiteful they could to harm mankind and defy the will of the gods. Obviously they try to shroud their true intentions with lies and deception but to the true believer their schemes are laid bare by the gods like a rotting carcas in the sun. And though they deny it, all non-humans have some knowledge of the Shiron'Fal and support them at least by denying their existence. Thus, the true believer will never trust the words of a non-human. See their deceitful and treacherous ways. Strike them down with holy fury and let these heretics feel the wrath of the true gods, whose teachings they reject. Since the Shiron'Fall dig their vile and treacherous root deep into the hearts and minds of the non-humans, only their extermination can eradicate this threat to humanity.
