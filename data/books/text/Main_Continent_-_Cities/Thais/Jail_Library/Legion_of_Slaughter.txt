The first of the legion of slaughter were some of the unique creations of the gods. For not only races were created in the god wars but also individuals of power. Though most of these loners followed the path that the gods had planned for them, some lacking restraint and company became driven made by their loneliness. Crazed they defied the gods and banded together, accumulating an army of the mad and the lost. This army they lead onto a rampage through the battlefields of their days. They caused havoc and destruction on both sides but ultimately they were crushed and thought dead. But some of them survived, hidden at unholy places and feeding on them. In time they grew in power and when they arose again they were horrible to behold. Their rise fell into a time of relative peace, after the reawakening and those relics of war disdained what they saw. Where others saw harmony they saw weakness. Where others saw love, they saw a lack of ambition. They renewed their old bonds and looked for fallen allies of days long past. They reformed the legion, which was a mockery of the power of the past. Yet their madness, hatred and ambition drove them forward. They began to look for the guidable, the power-hungry and baited them with poisoned promises. They are still out there, scheming, manipulating, looking to increase their power in clear defiance of all gods.
