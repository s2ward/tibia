We have learnt from captured demon servants that the Ruthless Seven have occupied some new base and are preparing some kind of doomsday device there. It seems to be their intention to attack one of the major cities and to turn it into hell on earth. Our sources are highly reliable. The Ruthless Seven have deployed some of their most powerful lieutenants to ensure the success of their mission. Strangely, the things we read in the minds of these lieutenants did not point to the Plains of Havoc as expected but to the remote isle of Edron. We are aware that there are some ancient ruins north of Edron. Orshabaal, who is a powerful servant of the Ruthless Seven, might appear in this area to scare people away and to distract any attention. Our main task is to find this secret place of the Ruthless Seven and to kill the lieutenants there. Finally, the doomsday device has to be destroyed.
