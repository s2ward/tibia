On the movement of objects
As everyone knows many objects do not remain static all the time. But what causes them to move? In some cases this is clear, if I punch a ball I am the cause of the movement, but whatabout an object falling?
Falling objects head downwards, but what is "down", what is below us? The answer is simple: Hell! And who rules hell? Satan! So, obviously Satan is the cause of these movements, Satan is among us all the time. But if he causes these objects to fall, what reason is there that he should not be the cause of all other movements?
