Alistair Cropwell's Travel Notes
...strange things I saw today! A mighty city, inhabited with fearsome beings. Dark rituals, the reason of which I could not discern. Are these people friend or foe? I do not know. I remain in hiding and observe.. and what is the meaning of this strange talisman that I found? The symbol appears everywhere, I fear it may have powers that could cause damage in the wrong hands.
I have been travelling so long, I can hardly remember the features of my beloved ones. Will they recognise, will they remember me? What will they make of my tales? Oh, that I be back with them, walk the city again...
