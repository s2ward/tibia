Dolis, Planegazer and Headmaster of the Scriptorum
This log seems to be more than a few decades old and is nearly illegible. One passage reads:
"...what seems to be the very first of many mysterious chests. We tried everything to open it. But it refuses to spill its secrets. My assistants suggested to request advice from the council. Secretive and hesitant as they are, they suggested not to proceed until we know more about what we're dealing with."
Another illegible passage is followed by:
"...we shall never find him if we continue hiding in the shadows, prying old rubble and dusty tomes. My own plan was deemed too radical an approach. Instead, the council recommended to erect a chamber of knowledge around this recent discovery. My group was commanded to guard the chest and to
hide its existence like we did with all our recent findings. Me? A mere custodian of what might have been the missing part to a puzzle I spent a lifetime of research on? obey. We will guard it and keep it secret. But know that the creature never sleeps, never rests and never falters. Ever walking the planes he is bound to arrive here sooner or later. What the council fails to understand is that this is not and has never been a chase, it's an assault on our very existence."
