The story of old Dragons mountain...
Author: Anonymous
It is said, that near the swamp of the damned there is supposed to be a dragons lair in the mountains north of it. Legends speak about dragons with red scales and a fiery breath, which store great amounts of treasure in their lair. But since nobody will have the courage to go there, it will never be known, if the legends are true.
