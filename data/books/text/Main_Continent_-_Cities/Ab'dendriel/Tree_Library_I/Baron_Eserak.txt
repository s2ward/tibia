Baron Eserak was the spiritual leader of a knightly order, devoted to the service of the gods. As a gathering of philosophical and pious men and women, the order often met in debates on spiritual matters. Often such debates lead to heated argument because most members were extremely set in their opinions and points of view in religious matters. Over the time two fractions arose that at least vaguely agreed on crucial points to which the other faction strongly disagreed. Heated debates led to violent arguments and over the time this bred an atmosphere of hatred. When Eserak learned that the opposing faction secretly planned to split he saw his grand plan in danger. He gathered his most loyal and devoted members and lead them in a violent purge of the dissenters. The once wise and serene man had become infuriated about what he saw as the ultimate betrayal and he was not willing to show any mercy. But even after the purge of the order he would not find his peace. The shock of the defection by so many of his former brethren and sisters left him paranoiac. Seeing traitors everywhere he lead several more purges and was driven so far as to burn several of his loyal friends on the base of dubious suspicions. Listening to false advisors his harsh actions lead to the loss of many members, either because they were killed as heretics or because they left the order in disgust. Since the knights of the order hailed from some of the most powerful families of the realm, the schism spilled over into a civil war. The weakened order and their supporters were greatly outnumbered and to restore peace even the crown sided with its enemies. Unwilling to be brought to an - in his eyes heretic - trial, he took his own live before he could be arrested.
