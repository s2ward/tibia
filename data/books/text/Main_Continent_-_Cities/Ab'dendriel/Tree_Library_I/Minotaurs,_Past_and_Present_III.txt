To become an educated warrior-philosopher became the goal of all minotaurkind. Uncontrolled rage was considered to be primitive from then on. A minotaurian warrior is skilled as an artist, often found conentrated drawing, reciting or creating poems and wielding a weapon with awarenes and cold hearted skill. The warriors of the uppermost class are usually so well educated they control some amount of magic, often used to augment their own strength and defense. They are the heroes and role models of the lower class. The minotaurs still have a warrior culture, but the understanding of a true warrior has changed dramatically.
Minotaur cheese is a specialty, often envied by decadent human nobles.
