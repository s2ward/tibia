The Fall of Spiritkeep 

Due to the great earthquake during the third age of Tibia, the Stormknights 
castle Spiritkeep crumbled to pieces, by the shattering force of the 
rumbling earth. This was when Kalen Leah moved out, to find the Elves, and 
when he finally found them. He told them of his order and of his plans to 
guard the elven city of Alwasala. So the elves decided to build a new 
castle for the Stormknights, with the name of Northwatch.
