We confirm that the Ruthless Seven have occupied the place which is known as Pits of Inferno. With the help of divination, we were able to see that they channelled their dark essence to some remote place in our world for unknown reasons. We could not figure out this place, though. It cannot be emphasised enough that it is extremely important to find this place and if possible, to destroy it.
