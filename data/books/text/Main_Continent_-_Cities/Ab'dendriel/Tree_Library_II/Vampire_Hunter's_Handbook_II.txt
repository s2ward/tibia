Vampire Hunter's Handbook II
Vampires can be immobilised, also for a very long time, if the right method is used. If their physical body takes too much damage, it will go down. Sunlight will dry them out and even turn them into dust. If you drive a wooden object into the heart of a vampire, the flow of the vampire's tainted blood is stopped, leaving him completely helpless. It should be mentioned, though, that if the heart is partly missed or if the object is not large enough, the vampire might still be able to move.
Since a vampire is dead anyway, none of these methods allows to destroy a vampire for good. With enough time and blood, a vampire can recover from any of those seeming deaths. The only known way to permanently defeat a vampire is to kill him with a blessed stake. A blessed stake, however, is a rare object that cannot be obtained easily.
