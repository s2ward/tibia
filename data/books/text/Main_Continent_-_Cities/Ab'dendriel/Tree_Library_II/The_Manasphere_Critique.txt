Manasphere?
by Othis Ethna
I don't want to minimize the value of <name of First author>'s work. But to me it lacks any proof! Thus Ashkil's explanation is as good as the idea that the beings are producing the mana themselfes! And what about the "planet is surrounded"-statement? How should he know without leaving this planet? Either there's another (now lost) book that deals with the experiments and their results, or the whole "manasphere" is only an unproofable theory!
