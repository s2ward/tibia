Dear brother,
we are not pleased about your progress. The reports about 'the ice working against you' are pathetic.
Don't disappoint our masters, I warn you. Instead of embattling a veritable army, you just freed some minor troops - by far not sufficient for the plans of our master. With the growing presence of Orshabaal in the realm of mankind, it is likely the seven will make their move soon. We must do everything to be faster. This army is pivotal for our success. For this reason you were chosen to lead the operation. However, everything you achieved in the past will mean nothing if you fail now. Make sure the lord of blades won't decide on his next visit that it is time for an ... extraordinary punishment.
Praised be the Triangle.
