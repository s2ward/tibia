Dear brother,
it's a good thing that you were able to build a base in the mountains. Don't worry, the passing of you and your followers did not raise too much suspicions. Our agents in Carlin made sure to distract all attention and whatever the barbarians in Svargrond might think is of no importance. We managed to acquire a ship which we will be sent with reinforcements to the meeting point, remote enough from all possible observers. I expect that the camp is prepared and the area scouted at the time our forces arrive. The master expects a swift and precise strike to take over the mines. The fools in Svargrond will probably not even notice the change there since they are busy to be wary of the other barbarians. Our agent in Svargrond will do what is possible to further divert any attention. As soon as the mines are taken you will begin to defrost our new allies. Make sure they learn whom they owe their freedom.
Praised be the Triangle.
