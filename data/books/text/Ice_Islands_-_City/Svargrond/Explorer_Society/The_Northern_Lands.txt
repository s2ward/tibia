The northern lands proved to be a worthy object for our studies. After exploring the northern seas and verifying the absence of the sea serpents, we have no little part in reestablishing the contact with the Svargrond community. Now that ships will sail to Svargrond on a regular base, we should be able to use the gratitude our society has gained to get some necessary support for our explorations. The news about the reopening of the shipping lines will spread and adventurers and soldiers of fortune will surely arrive to seek fame and treasures. Perhaps some can be of help, though vital missions should only be entrusted to people who are already members of our noble explorer's society.
