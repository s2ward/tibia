The mining operations are progressing promisingly. Regular shipments to Carlin are established and we get along with the locals decently. Some of the northmen are still opposing our presence but most are supportive and appreciate the wares that our agreement brings to their lands. The small landing place for our ships has grown into a small settlement and I think we can pride ourselves on being witnesses of the birth of a town.
