This is a sad day. We will abandon our mine. Which was once the pride of Carlin will now sink into oblivion. Some of the miners decided to stay here in the settlement the northmen have built. They know that no more ships will arrive here. Carlin is giving up this venture for good and as long as there is the threat of the sea serpents no contact will be made.
Perhaps the serpents will be gone as quickly as they appeared. At least that's what some of the people who stay behind are hoping I guess. Others have found the love of their life here and will stay for that reason. Be it as it may, my days here have come to an end. I can just hope that our ship will make it through the serpents and that we will all arrive safely in our old home.
