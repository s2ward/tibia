A ship from Carlin confirmed our assumptions. The ship was also attacked by sea serpents and only managed to arrive here badly damaged. We have no clue why those vile beasts are even here in the northern seas. They usually live in the South and are never seen in such great numbers. If the presence of the sea serpents persists, we can do little but to give up our mining operations here. We have lost too much already and there seems to be no way to fight the serpents effectively.
