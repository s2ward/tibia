Chef Luc Venin's Exquisite Cuisine with Poison

Introduction
In order to keep your warriors healthy, fed and, in addition to that, their poison resistance at a maximum - you have to add poison to your food.
(The book goes on about the manifold benefits of poisoned nutrition.)
Chapter 3 - Dosage is the Key
Adding just a pinch of the poison from the fangs of our great matron's domesticated snakes will significantly harden your organism. Not only against the bite of the glorious cobra, but all kinds of poisons. The potency of this poison is so high, that it can paralyze a grown man within the first 10 seconds of it entering the body. Death will follow in under two minutes, so you will probably kick the proverbial bucket before even regaining the ability to move. Just a hint of the poison in a <this part has been completely redacted> will be enough for <again a redacted part> for a whole garrison of warriors. Even an already sensitized organism will not be able to process more than <again a redacted part> which will result in severe stomach aches and... well, if a whole crew of assassins has to deal with the runs at the same time, you will probably wish yourself away to a different place. Prevent situations like this and be careful with the dosage.
