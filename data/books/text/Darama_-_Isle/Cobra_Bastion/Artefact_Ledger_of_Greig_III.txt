Artefact Ledger of Greig, treasurer of the Order of the Cobra

(A scribbled note right on top of the list that says:)
I was trying to put a new artefact into the vault, you know, one of those Scarlett has deemed harmless and "righteous"... which means it's sellable now. Anyway, it was basically just an empty chest. Came in from the last expedition. I am sure there was nothing in it when I first laid eyes on it. However, when I later checked it in the vault, it had a few coins in it. When I returned with other things, the chest had been removed. Placed right outside the vault. Just to see if everything was alright, I checked the chest. And the coins were gone! I brought it back, together with other valuable stuff. It appeared to me that it would probably be a good idea to just place some of the stuff in the empty chest. But when I opened it, the coins were back, and it seems the thief added even more coins to make up for his mistake,
(A hastily scribbled note right below that says:) After leaving, I found the chest right outside the vault and it was empty once again! When I put it back, the coins had been replaced and once again additional coins had been put into the chest! Under my watch!! Who does something like that. I will position myself next to the chest and remain in the vault to find the culprit if it's the last thing I do. Furthermore, I swear I saw something a few moments ago. Like a shadow, a shape more than anything. If that's the thief, he will answer to me right here.
