"The Order of the Cobra" Compendium (by an unknown chronicler)

III - Rise of the Cobra

When Scarlett discovers a powerful amulet in a nameless crypt, the old order is already in shambles. Inside the tomb, next to the sarcophagus of a nameless entity, several burial objects and memorabilia of long forgotten generations, the sculpture of a cobra sits firmly, the amulet draped prominently on top of it. An inscription at the bottom of the sculpture warns: "The bearer of this amulet will command the gaze, the resilience and deadliness of the cobra. Yet what firmly has its place in the heart of its wearer, the cobra will conceal." Taking the amulett, Scarlett is instantly overwhelmed by its grasp and the power it holds within. At this point she is already too weak to destroy it according to her own codex. The dodgy bunch of bandits and assassins she now calls her allies is far from a sworn fellowship. Most of them of dubious morals, full of fear and acting more on their own behalf than that of the group. Thus, noone can muster enough courage to challenge her as she puts on the amulet. The gaze of the cobra allows the wearer to see through the material plane into infinite distance. With the help of this artefact's powers, any attackers, thieves and whoever will stand in her way, shall be easy prey for Scarlett.
