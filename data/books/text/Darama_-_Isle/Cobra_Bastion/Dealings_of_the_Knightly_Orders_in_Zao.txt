Dealings of the Knightly Orders in Zao

(This text consists of voluptuous descriptions of knights in shining armour, discovering the largely unexplored continent of Zao. With a focus on the disappearance of the Order of the Falcon and their quest for a lost almanac. Most of the pages dealing with time distortion have been ripped out, however, the avid reader will find various references to the Spatial Warp Almanac with somewhat vague memoranda on how it could have been used.)
(a small note has been scribbled below the text: Nb8-d7 (4/4)
