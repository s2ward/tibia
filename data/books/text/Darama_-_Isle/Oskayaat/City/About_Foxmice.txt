About Foxmice
The foxmouse is a mammal species that looks like a combination of a fox and a mouse, yet big enough to serve as a mount for humans. Foxmice typically have red-orange fur, large ears and a shaggy tail. Nocturnal animals, they are most active in the evening and night hours. They are social creatures and are usually found in groups of up to ten, but their subterranean caves are very hidden and hard to find.
Foxmice have the ability to sense magnetic fields and use them to navigate. Their senses are highly developed and they use them to find food, detect potential predators and communicate with other foxmice. They have sharp eyesight, hearing and smell. Although living in underground burrows, they are excellent climbers and can even scale trees and cliffs with their strong claws.
Foxmice are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. They will eat berries, fruits, nuts and seeds as well as insects, fish and small creatures.
