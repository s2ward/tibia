The special flora of Oskayaat, which is shimmering blue in the moonlight, is a recent phenomenon on the island. There are various theories about its origin. Some think it is related to the moon goddess. Amati is a gentle and benevolent deity who brings joy and peace to the world. She created the dewberry palm and the foxmouse, her holy plant and animal.
Recently, Amati was in pain because she had witnessed a volcanic eruption destroying and killing many of her beloved creations. She mourned for the loss of so much life and beauty and her tears fell to the earth. Where they did, the plants changed and became bluish in the moonlight. This signifies that the plants are connected to Amati and her tears and that they can draw power from her presence. It is a sign that Amati is watching over her faithful followers.
Others are convinced that the reasons are more sinister. They think the plants are affected by something that is already known in other parts of Tibia as the Curse of the Full Moon. Actually, this phenomenon has so far only affected animals. Humans, when bitten by such cursed animals, turn into ravenous beasts themselves: wolves, bears, foxes, hyaenas ... But on Oskayaat, for the first time, plants also seem to be affected. Some palms, ferns or cacti turn into bluish specimens during the full moon. Worse still, it didn't stop with the plants changing only during the full moon. Recently, they seem to change their appearance every night. Our scholars suspect that, at some point, the consumption of dewberries from affected palms could trigger such a transformation in humans as well. It is therefore to be strongly recommended to all inhabitants of Oskayaat to refrain from eating such blue dewberries.
