The Swimmer Part I
Translation from 'Jekhr' (language of the Deeplings)
By Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
And when the Swimmer reached the bottom of the sea, he was enlightened by the beauty of the deep. The lively cities of the Deeplings greeted him from the bosom of the ocean. Drowning in colour and light, the Swimmer reached the sea's moist bed, surrounded by guardians of the deep. But their welcome was of little warmth. They did not see a foreigner nor a stranger, not a visitor but a threat.
