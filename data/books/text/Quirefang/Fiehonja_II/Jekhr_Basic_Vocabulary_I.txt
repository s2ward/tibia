Exercises, Chapter II: Basic Vocabulary 1 (A-D)
Additional notes: Most complex words are constructed of smaller basic vocabulary. For example: 'surface' ('gouthn') consists of 'over/up' ('gou') and 'face' ('thn'). Ligatures appear as consonants only as in 'Qjell' ('Qjell'). An 'i' at the end of a word will always be pronounced as 'ee'. A verb is negated if it is followed by 'ro'. For example: 'lume' ('reach') followed by 'ro' ('not') means 'not to reach'.
