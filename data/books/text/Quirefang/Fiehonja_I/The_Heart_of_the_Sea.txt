The Heart of the Sea
By Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
The Deeplings seem to be fond of the colour red. Otherwise, I cannot explain their obsessive dedication to mine and process rubies while widely ignoring the other gems that can be found in the rocks and cliffs of this subaquarian world. Extraordinarily large rubies are refined even further. The most valuable and perfected is the blood-red "Heart of the Sea". Once I witnessed the stone being inserted into an impressive statue during some kind of ceremony at the large central passageway they call Apex of Worship.
