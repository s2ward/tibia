The Swimmer Part II
Translation from 'Jekhr' (language of the Deeplings)
By Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
Held captive for two lifetimes he became one with the stone and coral that bound him. He longed for the world above. Wandering the skies again in broad daylight. Roaming the deserts, mountains and vast plains of the world like he used to. Floating a drop above the rain and dodging beams of the twin suns, he would embrace the disembodied freedom of his true self.
He was a spirit and a ghost. His soul moved into the very walls and fences of every house and court. Claiming the very foundations of this watery city as his own.
The Swimmer now lingers in shadowy corners, damp and dark and hollow. Chasing flickers of light touching the ground like a cat born of fog. When the creatures of the deep fell for the first visitor, he mourned the loss of the good in their souls. When the colour finally fled from its last enclave, he longed for redemption.
What is left of the light once brought to us, what remains of the fires once thriving us, it is he.
