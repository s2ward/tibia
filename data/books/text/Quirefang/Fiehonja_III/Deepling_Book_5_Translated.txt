Interpretation:
Senx, book one.
When the creatures of the deep shall embrace the second coming, the first gift will be the dawn of Senx the invader of the deep. When the tide of the second coming strikes he'll turn water into f(l)ame. where he touch the dead bodies of those that don't obey will be swallowed by the boiling sea. He paves the way and heralds the second coming. We shall bow to you in battle, our profound invader Senx.
