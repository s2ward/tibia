The Drowned Library
Personal notes of Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
The once bright centre of the Deepling community has been given up ever since the days of the Second Coming. After their leaders were convinced that their future lied above sea level, more and more of them stopped maintaining the archives and tending for the books. With the Deeplings rallying for war, the great halls of the library were soon abandoned. The culture of these creatures is complex enough to produce a significant amount of literature. I have found several works about sea animals, food, architecture and even early philosophical theories. However, progression of the Deepling culture in this direction has long been abandoned in favour of war preparations or social oppression of lower castes.
