The Chronicles of Daraman I
That was the time when Daraman was captured by the djinns while he was fasting and meditating in the desert. They put him in heavy chains and brought him before Gabel's throne. There the old man stood, all haggard and torn, amidst the splendour of the djinns' court. And the djinns started teasing and tormenting the human with a thousand malicious tricks, trying to strike terror in his heart. But frail and crippled though he was, Daraman never so much as flinched under the pain, and his will could not be broken. Finally Malor, who was the most vicious and godless of the djinn, lost his patience and raised his hand to strike the final blow. But lo!, just when his deadly scimitar was about to strike the prisoner down Gabel's voice thundered through the hall, ordering Malor to stop. And though mighty Malor trembled with anger and spite, he did not dare challenge his king's authority.
