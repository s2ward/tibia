The Chronicles of Daraman V
Gabel told Daraman of the visions and dreams that haunted him and asked Daraman for advice. So Daraman asked him to open up his soul for him to see. And Gabel opened his heart and soul to him. When Daraman had seen deep into Gabel's soul he understood the pain and the confusion that lay hidden deep inside it, and he wept bitter tears of pity for Gabel and for the whole of his race, for he saw that the djinn were a forlorn race that had been cast away by its creator. So full of divine compassion were his tears that they froze into immaculate gemstones of pure blue crystal as soon as they left his eyes. It is said that that springs of clear freshwater sprang forth from the earth wherever one of them hit the ground.
