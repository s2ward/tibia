The events starts each 4 hours. You will get an information 15 minutes in advance.
When the event starts, all participants will be teleported into the challenge area.
Use your wand of tricks while standing on the white ground floor. You should do this immediately after your teleport.
You will be turned into a certain animal and only have a few seconds to reach the corresponding teleporter.
If you do not manage to reach the teleporter, you have lost your chance on that occasion and are out.
If you have managed to reach the safety of a room, you will be teleported back to the central chamber where the procedure begins anew.
The next cycle works the same but will grant you less time to reach safety.
This will continue for a given time.
In the end, at least one participant has to reach safety.
If no participant is left before the event ends, the event fails.
A world needs a certain amount of successful events in order to succeed.
