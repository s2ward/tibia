Oh Torrivan, love of my life, why did you have to go into the Dreaded Swamp to fight the evil spirits? Now we will never again be united under the light of this sun, your unborn son will grow up without knowing the wisdom and courage of his father, and the years of my life will pass in shadow and sorrow. I can but hope the gods will have mercy on us, and let us embrace again in the next life.
