On the Nature of the Undead, Vol. 1
Preface
There are several forms of the so-called "undead".  Indeed, it is a most natural phenomenon, and we have to discern thusly between the natural undead, appearing out of a natural course, e.g., out of some supreme will inherent to the late inhabitant of our world of the living; and between the scientific method of inducing undeath , and creating undead through an outside, e.g. OUR, will. Of the natural undead, little use can be made, for they obey their own strong will and will not be bended or made to pursue more noble fashions after our own will; so the most noble art of a necromancer lies in besting the natural course, indeed, in perfectioning it, and in bringing back life in death, and creating able-bodied subjects to carry out the most noble purposes of our order.
