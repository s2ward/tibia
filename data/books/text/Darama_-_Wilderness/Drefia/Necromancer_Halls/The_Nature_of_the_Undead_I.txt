On the Nature of the Undead, Vol. 1
Vol. I, Chapter 1
As I have said in my preface, we have to discern between two main categories of undead: the "natural" and the "technical" undead. The natural undead make up for most of the undead types; and we have but to wonder at the mean understanding of the outsiders to our art not seeing this. I will begin my dissertation with categorizing the undead, beginning with the natural undead in this first chapter, followed by a categorization of the technical undead in the second chapter. The means of resurrecting the undead will be studied and an ample introduction be given by my honoured colleague, professor rer. mort. Arrazul Alhazri in his book "An Initiation to Practical Necromancy".
Thus, to return to our study: the nature of the undead. The natural undead,  like ghosts and vampires, are indeed abundant on this world. Many have been spotted in the different locations in Tibia, and all seem to pursue a singular goal, which they have been denied in life and which they therefore seek to achieve in undeath.  As many of the lesser mortals that inhabit the lands of Tibia are not able to reach their goals in life, one must not wonder at the abundancy of the natural undead.
To the natural undead, we count the following specimen with their sub-classifications:
1.	Ghosts:
a)	spectres
b)	spirits
c)	phantasms
d)	 apparitions
2.	banshees
3.	reapers
4.	vampires
a)	vampire bats
b)	vampire brides
c)	vampire lords
5.	 Special consideration must be given to the hybrid classes:
a)	 lesser forms of demon spirits
b)	Ghouls
c)	mummies
