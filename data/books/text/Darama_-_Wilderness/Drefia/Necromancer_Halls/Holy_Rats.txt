From the Annals of the Priestess of the Dark Lands:
Rats are the Dark Lord's most favoured pets. These holy dark creatures must not be touched upon lest we incur the wrath of the Dark Lord. Sisters, do not let unholy creatures touch upon these, and always perform the Rites of Midnight, Blood Chains and Skull Music at their specified times.
