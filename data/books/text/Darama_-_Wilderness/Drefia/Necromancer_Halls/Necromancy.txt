Necromancy, a Philosophical Essay, by the Dark Brother Alonso de Iverra
Brothers, why does the ignorant world still consider death their enemy and end of life? It is not folly? Death is but the portal, not the end; it is but an artificial hindrance to ward off the lesser spirits from the realm of the mighty; and the gods put it up to prevent us Chosen from ascension to their own powers, and threaten their dominion. These shackles to our existence are unnatural; but it is natural to rebel and to seek power, yes, to gain power, to exert power! Brothers, we must overcome this hindrance set up by the jealous gods and claim our rightful place! We are the masters of the living and undead, the true lords of the created, and nothing shall stop us from achieving what we seek.
