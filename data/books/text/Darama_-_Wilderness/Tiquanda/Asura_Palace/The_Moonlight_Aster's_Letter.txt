My dear sisters,

our old foes, the nagas, are naive enough to believe that they have successfully expelled us from their little jungle paradise. They are unaware that we have found ways to return there, using the portals they believed are sealed for us. Little do they know that we created an artefact that can work as a key. We divided it into three parts and locked those parts away in three different treasure chambers. If you need the artefact, take three feathers of the birds we cherish: peacock, flamingo and swan. They will show you the way. With the complete artefact we are able to use the portal high in the Khazeel Mountains. Some of our sisters have already returned to our old home to take vengeance for our exile.
