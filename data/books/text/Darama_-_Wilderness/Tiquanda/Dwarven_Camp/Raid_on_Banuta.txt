We raided that ape city but there was nothing that would have been worth to be taken. Seems those apes did not build that city after all. They are just primitive idiots. When we went to that river area southeast, we saw the lizards' settlement. Given the fact that they live in shabby huts but also built a huge stone structure similar to the ones in the ape city, I would bet the apes have driven those losers out.
