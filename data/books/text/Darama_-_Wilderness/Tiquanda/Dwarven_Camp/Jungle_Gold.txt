We built our camp far away from those greedy scammers in Port Hope that are planning on stealing our gold as soon as we have found it. I know it is here. I am a dwarf, I must know. The others get impatient like silly elves. Until now we have found only little gold but at least it proves that the gold is here and we will defend it fiercly against everyone that tries to steal it. We have already chased away those apes and lizards that used to prowl around here. Too bad there are no dworcs around whom me and the boys could teach about the sharpness of our axes. We have already killed some adventurers that came here. As if we did not knew that they are after our gold. I can see the greed in their eyes. They would kill for a nugget, so they get killed for a nugget.
