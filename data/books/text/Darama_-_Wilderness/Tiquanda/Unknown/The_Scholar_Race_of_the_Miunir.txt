The scholar race of the Miunir were the only ones who were able to read the records of the Astral Shapers. The Shaper records were partly written in the same astral patterns like the Miunir's texts. The Miunir were the once who copied and 'translated' many of the Shapers' texts and stored them in their vast libraries. Since the Miunir treasured knowledge above everything else, they refused to share their knowledge even with their closest friends. When the orcs overrun the Miunir enclaves, most of the knowledge was destroyed and lost forever. Luckily, some of the Miunir's works about the Shapers survived. However, the forbidden treasures of knowledge the Miunir had collected was met with much more interest than the remaining Shapers knowledge. Only recently interest in the Astral Shapers knowledge was revived. Even though the works of the Miunir are often seen as part of the so-called Shaper records, the records themselves are much more important and full of vital information. After being translated, copied and rewritten numerous times, some of these texts, however, are now nearly worthless. The most adequate texts are those written in ancient Miunir. However, since many self-absorbed scientists found it fancy to show off by writing their own works in Miunir, texts written in this ancient language are no longer a guarantee for quality.
