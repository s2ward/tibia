How to mix magical potions
Potion of Invisibility
This potion is one of the most difficult potions to mix. Besides you need lots of time, you also need great magical abilties.
The ingredients you should have are:
a rat's tail
2 teeth of a dead troll
a piece of a ghouls robe
2 ghoul-breads
a dragon's eye
green slime
Put these things together in a pot and cook it about 25 minutes. Afterwards, speak the magical words: "Munga Mungos" towards the pot.
Now the potion is ready for use. Good luck and happy cooking!
