About the true nature of objects
by ...
What are all objects around us made of? Do they consist of the same things?
Could we divide things infinitly many times? The answer is quite obvious to anyone, who ever tried to cut a grain of sand into pieces. I tried it with the sharpest sword I own, and I can tell for sure: It is not possible to divide a grain of sand! Therefore, everything around us is made out of sand.
You might say: Hold on! How could a hard thing like a stone be made out of sand? Well, again we can find a simple solution: Take a big hammer and destroy the stone! What you will get is: sand, again!
