The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection
by Dave Charlwin

After years of research, I believe I have found the origin of of any living creature that exists in our dimensions. First,
shortly after our world was created, the were just stones and earth. There were small stones, big stones, gray and brown
stones, sharp and round stones. Some of these stones looked very much like today's seeds; that isn't just per chance.
Obviously, some of the round, small, brown stones,which were somehow placed some fingerlength deep in the earth, started
growing in the directions of the sun - in the opposite direction of hell. That is how plants and trees were created
- big trees came out of big stones, small plants out of small stones.

Now one may ask oneself (or me): How did animals come into the world?
I thought really long about this question, and I obviously found the correct answer.

Once there were plants existing they started "mixing" with stones:
Plants are living objects (just like
animals are), but they can't move very fast (animals move fast). Stones on the other hand do not live, but they can
move very fast (think about stones falling down a mountain).

That's how animals and monsters started to exist.
