How to mix magical potions
Potion of Silence
Do you have friends, who are nice but who can't stop talking and talking and talking....?
Make them stop it by drinking this potion!
The ingredients are as follows:
a dead spider
a potion of wine
a potion of beer
two cans of water
a piece of gold (silence is golden!)
an apple
and, of course,
a rapier to stir with
and finally a can to put it in.
You don't have to cook it (unless you want to serve it as a hot drink); you just need to cast: "Silentiam" on it.
Your friends will love the taste of this mixture, and they will be silent for a greater
amount of time. We suggest, that the reader himself does not drink this fluid, too.
Good luck and enjoy the silence!
