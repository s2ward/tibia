... This is the sixth day. It seems, the inhabitants start trusting me and begin to communicate with me.
I found out about colours and their words in gharonk.
"Red" means "narz", the word for "green" is "buzgob", "orolu" is "gold", "shura" stands for "blue" and "urbum" is the gharonk word for "yellow". Furthermore, I found out the words for "yes" and "no". "Yagla" means "yes", "glub" means "no", but it's also the word for "none", "not", and so on.
I just wonder why they keep on calling me "gar". Did they give me a name?
