The Adventurer's Guide To The Dungeons.
Troll: Trolls are some kind of strange monsters. They run around without having a target, telling stories no one can understand because of their unclear pronunciation (which results from the fact, that trolls do not have teeth at all). Trolls can easily be identified by their appearance: red skin, not too big, mostly in groups, often carrying a spear and a wooden shield to fight (of course, they do not know how to use these things properly...). Some Trolls (they are supposed to be the leaders of troll-groups) carry ropes and money with them - reasons are not known, but it is believed that they use ropes to climb down wells, what does surely not explain why trolls need money...
