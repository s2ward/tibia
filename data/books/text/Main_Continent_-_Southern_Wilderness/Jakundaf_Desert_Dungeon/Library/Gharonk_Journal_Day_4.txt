Notes about gharonk language
... It's now the forth day here in this town. I wasn't able to find out, how the town is called, but that doesn't seem important to me. More important seems to me to find out more details of gharonk language. I found out that they use some words for some different but similar expressions. Gharonk doesn't seem to distinguish between the word for "I" (nag) and the words for "mine", "my", "me", and so on. That makes the language more simple, and I think it's always clear what it means from the context. Of course, that are only speculations, I'm not quite sure about it at all...
