On mixing potions.
Now, being a really old magician, I decided to write down some of the formulas of potions I invented during my lifetime. First I thought it will be best to give clear advices for everyone to mix them. But after some days of crucial thinking I had a vision - everyone would be able to mix these powerful but dangerous potions within minutes without being aware of the consequences! It needs lot of wisdom and willpower to become a experienced and responsible magician. This doesn't mean to be cowardish - it means that you know your powers and that you exactly know your limits!
So, to prevent misuse of this knowledge i will write down these formulas in ****, a very old language only known by the wisest sorcerers.
