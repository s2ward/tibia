Notes about gharonk language
... On my journeys, one day I found a nice, little city. Not too many people lived there, and they spoke a strange language.
After trying to speak to some of it's inhabitants, I found out, that they call this language "gharonk".
In the next days, I will try to figure out, how this language works - I really wish I would understand what they try to tell me!
