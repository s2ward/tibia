About strange mechanisms
In the last few years, people began to use strange mechanisms to do different kinds of things. For example it is popular nowadays, to open or unlock doors by switches. However, there are different ways to realize such a switch, e.g. by using hydraulic pressure. Only a few persons have the knowledge to construct such switches.
