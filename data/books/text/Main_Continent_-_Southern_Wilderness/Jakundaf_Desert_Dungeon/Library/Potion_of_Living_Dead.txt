How to mix magical potions
Potion of living dead
Lost a friend? Your pet died? If it is like that, there's a solution for you!
Just follow the instructions. You'll need some ingredients:
the head of a (dead) dog
some oil
a rat's tail
two teeth of an orc
flour
a fishbone
2 potions of fresh green or red slime
a piece of wood
a bone of an undead
and, of course,
a rapier to stir with
and finally a pot to cook in it.
If you cook these things for 32 minutes and cast the magical words "maldan liflif" upon it, your potion is finished. Put some drops of it onto the dead body you want to resurrect.
Good luck and happy cooking!
