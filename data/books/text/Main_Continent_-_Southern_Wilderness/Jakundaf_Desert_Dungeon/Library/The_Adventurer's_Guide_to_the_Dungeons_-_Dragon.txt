The Adventurer's Guide To The Dungeons.
Dragon: This is a well known species in our lands. Dragons once were very shy and there didn't exist many of them. And there's the paradox thing about it: Because they were hunted more and more, and more and more of them got killed, the dragons population increased! It's a very mysterious thing, that a species's population increases the more they are killed, but it's what happend with dragons...
So the conclusion is obvious, that many monsters want human population to increase and therefore try to kill as many of them as possible!
