The Adventurer's Guide To The Dungeons.
Rope: A rope is a long thing in most cases. It is useful to climb up holes and to pull up heavy objects, such as dragons, empty potions or spiders. Sometimes, in special cases, it is used to pull up demons or giant spiders. A rope consists of many rat-tails tied together. Such a thing should not be missing in an adventurer's backpack!
It is not known, how it works in some cases - for example, no one found out until now, why one has to put a rope on the floor in order to climb UP a hole. Especially it is strange, that this rope does not get lost, but is found in the backpack of the adventurer again...
