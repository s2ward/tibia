The second kind of fluids are brown. There are several types of brown fluids.
The first one is called "beer". It is, to say, one of the real bad substances in our known world: It is tasty, it smells well and everyone likes it. But beware! It makes addicted! Once you drank a potion of it you won't be able to control your senses anymore!
You won't even be able to walk on a line! So, if possible, avoid this fluid. Just imagine you were hunting and your life depends on your reaction, on your movement, and on your visual impressions!
