How to mix magical potions
Potion of fast movement
This potion makes the user run faster than the fastest known creature. It is not known, if there is a brake once the effect disappears.
You will need the following things:
a tail of a very fast creature
some mud
a piece of wood
a flower
and, of course,
a rapier to stir with
and finally a pot to cook in it.
Cook this fluid for 9 minutes and cast the words "rurnum maelis" in the direction of the cooking fluid. Put a drop of it on each shoe you wear and run!
Good luck, happy cooking and beware of obstacles!
