"On different Fluids, 4th publication"
by Arisophlus
Next, I will write about pink fluids. There are two kinds of pink fluids: wine and mysterious mana-regenerating fluid. What I told before about beer is exactly the same for wine. The other pink fluid seems to be very magical. Some people are able to produce this liquid; what a pity, all of these people sell it for horrendous prices!
