How to mix magical potions
Potion of demonic transformation
Take good care of this potion. It is very dangerous, since it transforms anyone who drinks it into a demon!
This transformation isn't reversible...
The ingredients are:
a potion of red slime
the eye of a demon
a piece of paper with a footprint of a demon.
Now put the eye and the slime on the piece of paper and wrap it. Cast the words "urtuo sinium" on it.
Take this object and place it for 24 hours next to any drink. Afterwards, this drink will transform the
one who drinks it into a demon.
I again warn you: It might happen that you accidently swallow this drink yourself!
