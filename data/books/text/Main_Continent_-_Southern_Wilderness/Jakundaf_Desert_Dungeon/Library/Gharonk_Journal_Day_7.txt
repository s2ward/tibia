... It's now my last day of the first week here. From day to day, I am able to talk more and better with the people living here. I like it, the people are nice, I get food and drink. The king, or I'd better say their leader, showed me his "throne". It's more like a place on the floor, where he sits when talking to his people. He pointed with his finger at this place, saying: "Nag mogurz, nag mogurz". I guess, it means something like "my place, my place". I found out many other words, I wrote them all down in a table. Maybe I'll teach this language one day to someone, who is interested in....
