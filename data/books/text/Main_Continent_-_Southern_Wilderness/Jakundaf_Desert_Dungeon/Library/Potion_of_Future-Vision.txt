How to mix magical potions
Potion of future-vision
Once drunk, this potion allows you to see the future for some time. Since this potion is so mighty and powerful, the ingredients are very rare and therefore difficult to get.
You'll need at least the following things:
2 potions of clear water
a teardrop of a demon
fire from a dragons breath
a sting of a wasp
some hair of a gigantic spider
a nail of a finger of a king's child
the nose of a royal rat.
This potion is cooked in a golden pot and stired with a heroic sword. It needs to be cooked for two hours and a half, and you have to cast the words "murman thusis nalbo" on it.
Good luck and happy cooking!
