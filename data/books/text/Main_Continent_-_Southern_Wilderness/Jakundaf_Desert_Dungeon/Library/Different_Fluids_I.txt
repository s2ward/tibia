"On different Fluids, 1st publication"
by Arisophlus
There are some kinds of different fluids in our known world. I will try to categorize them in respect to their color.
To begin with, there are green fluids. I did not find many different kinds of green fluids.
In fact, I just found one. It's a mysterious thing, known as "slime" to the ordinary population. This "slime" has strange properties. On the one hand, it is nice to look at, on the other hand, it is poisonous, it doesn't smell nor taste well and it is sticky.
