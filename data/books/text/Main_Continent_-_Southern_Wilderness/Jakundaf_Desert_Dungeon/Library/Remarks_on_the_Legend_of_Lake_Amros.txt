Remarks on the legend of lake Amros
by ...
Some weeks ago, I spoke to my friend Othmor. Somehow, we spoke about the nearby Lake Amros.
Othmor visited Carlin some time before we met each other, and he said, rumors are going that it is somehow possible to raise parts of the lake, such that the water isn't as deep as it is now. This way, it should be possible to reach the little island in the middle of Lake Amros...
It is told, that there is something of value on this island. I never was able to reach it; my magical powers didn't last to get there...
