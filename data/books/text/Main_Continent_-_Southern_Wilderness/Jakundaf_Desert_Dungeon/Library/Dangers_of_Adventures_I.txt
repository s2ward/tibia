Dangers of Adventures
by Netlios
Volume I
An adventure is an exciting thing to do. Nevertheless it might be rather dangerous,
one may even die during his journeys through the lands!
I wrote the following books in order to show the fates of 5 men who devoted themselves
to discover new parts of Tibia. Each of them was a brave warrior and a superior explorer
and they all went through exciting adventures. Their journeys were of different duration -
one ended after 66 days, another after 100 days. Each journey ended in a very dangerous
situation; one situation even ended deadly!
