Dangers of Adventures
by Netlios
Volume III
The first potential source of danger I want to discuss is fire! Of course fire is necessary to survife wilderness - to cook our food, to have light, to warm ourselves in a cold and dark night ... But always take care: fire doesn't help us all time! Let me give you an example: One of our explorers was wounded badly, because he steped into an open fire he made himself to cook some fish he just cought in the nearby river. Of course, this was the end of his journey; it was shorter than the travelings of the joungest among the five adventurers.
