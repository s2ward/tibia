Dangers of Adventures
by Netlios
Volume VI
Because this topic seems the most important for me, I decided to write another
book to warn people of the danger of being attacked by monsters. Two more of our
adventurers (the ones I always tell about) were attacked by monsters:
Elaeus and the man, whos journey ended after 66 days, both were attacked by 
monsters. Both were jounger than Gadinius and the man who only barely escaped from 
the attacks of a mother-bear, who defended her babies. Heso, who too was one of
our adventurers, never saw a bear in his whole life.
One of the five adventurers was attacked by a pack of trolls!
