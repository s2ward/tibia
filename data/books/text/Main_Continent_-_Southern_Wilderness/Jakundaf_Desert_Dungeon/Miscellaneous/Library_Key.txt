Diary of Morrin
It seems, I found the entrance to the library. Unfortunately the door is closed, but somehow i have to get in. I searched around, but everyone I met claimed he hasn't got the key... I believe this guy with the red shoes and the blue trousers, who eats rolls with ham all day long, has it; he seems suspicious to me... he didn't seem to trust me, and I think, that is the reason why I didn't get the key. Maybe somehow I can show him, that he can trust me...
YEAH! I got it! I got the key to the library, and I hope, I can find a solution for my problems there! Somehow I convinced the old man to trust me, and finally we were real good friends! What a pity, I had to leave the library before dawn...
