Dangers of Adventures
by Netlios
Volume V
The next thing, maybe the most important topic these days, we will closer examine,
are monsters. Most adventurers die through monsters - be it because people are not 
well enough prepaired, be it because some people are surprised by eighter the 
apperance or the powers of a monster, be it because suddenly there are 20 monsters 
where you have expected only one. Always be aware: Our land is in fact dangerous 
and you always have to take into account that arround the next corner some 
monsters await you - monsters which you have never seen before!
Of course, I have a little story on this topic:
One adventurer of the five - his trip was at least 18 days shorter than the trip
of Hestus, who was one year jounger than him - climbed down a ladder, not thinking 
about the danger he might be in. When he finally touched the ground again, he saw 
himself eye in eye with a fire-spitting dragon. He tried to flee - too late. His
body was found weeks after his death...
Just to mention it: none of the two explorers mentioned above (Hestus and the man 
who was killed by a dragon) were 41 years old. The journey of the 41-year-old man
was longer than the journey of the man who died during his adventure.
