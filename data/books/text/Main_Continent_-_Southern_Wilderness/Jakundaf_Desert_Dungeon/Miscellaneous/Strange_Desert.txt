Expedition diary of Erin Cropwell
Day 1: After visiting my fathers grave, I headed northeast to explore the world 
behind the great vulcanic mountains.
Day 2: I sneaked through a great cave full of cyclopses. After hours of 
wandering and climbing I reached the other side.
Day 3: Following the coast to seek signs of life.
Day 4: Found a strange desert. In the middle there seems to be a ruin, I will 
examine this at night, because it's much too hot now.
Day 5: DAMN!!! I fell into the deep hole and broke both legs and a rib. All I can 
do is...
climb up      spider        poison
Tell my wife I lov...
