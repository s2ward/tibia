Dear master,
I write to inform you that the targets were eliminated as requested. I still regret that you decided to entrust that mercenary Ned Noxiuos with the task and I was only a mere spectator. Although efficiently done, there was no finesse or skill displayed in their elimination. The fallen paladin Ned Noxious simply provoked the said individuals in a tavern. As soon as one of them was stupid enough to draw a weapon, they were disposed by a combination of energy bombs and fireballs. Of course the authorities did little about it since the tavern's patrons did swear the others attacked first. It seems unlikely that Noxious has those abilities in stealthiness and subtle assassination that the stories grant him.
