The attempt to place a mole in the Brotherhood of Bones has not been successful yet. The major problem is that the brotherhood usually contacts promising candidates itself and not the other way around. The only success in arousing their interest led to the elimination of our hired necromancer by some local heroes. Seemingly the brotherhood stole the corpse later and reanimated it. I hope they did nothing with his spirit, else unwanted information might have leaked to them.
