It is sad that you had to inform us that the individual known as Ned Noxious wants only to cooperate with us as a freelancer. We do not suggest his elimination. He has proven his usefulness in the past and I fear even your pet assassin Malicious is far from having acquired the skills that Noxious possesses. Noxious is efficient yet expensive, but if it comes to really important missions, money matters little. Still, it is a sad thing to see that a freelancer outclasses the specialists who we invested a great deal of money in to train. Take Ned Noxious not as an obstacle but as a touchstone.
