The so-called tradition among the students to send a newly promoted assassin on some foolish quest has taken another life. The young Roland fell to death while trying to steal the flag from the Thaian castle. Not only that we lost the time and effort we put into his education, the whole affair did draw some unwanted attention on our organisation. It is quite certain that the young fool used some of our highly specialised equipment in his silly stunt. As far as we know the whole affair is still under observation by the local authorities. We have to find a way to draw their attention in another direction before too many questions are asked. I had two of the senior students eliminated to make an example for the future. Such occurrences must stop once for all but I fear the harm has been already done and is irrevocable.
