The plans are making good process. The method of indoctrination and disinformation is very successful. Each week we can send out new students to further our course. Caution is still needed of course. Our enemies are numerous and powerful. Should they ever learn about our plans and this facility, the whole project would be endangered. It is far too early to go public with our plans. Therefore I suggest to build a second base at some remote place. It is important that we have an emergency backup, regardless of the resources it would take.
