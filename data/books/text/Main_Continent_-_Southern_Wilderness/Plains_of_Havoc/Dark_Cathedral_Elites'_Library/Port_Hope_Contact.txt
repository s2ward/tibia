Our contact in Port Hope claims that he has not yet been able to make contact with the dworcs. I bet this coward has not even tried it. For the sheer distance it is not possible to punish him in an appropriate manner. If we would send a specialist, he could take care of that dworc contact. On the other hand, a local helper who is familiar with the jungle would probably prove more valuable than sending one of our assassins to a likely death by the hands of those cannibals.
