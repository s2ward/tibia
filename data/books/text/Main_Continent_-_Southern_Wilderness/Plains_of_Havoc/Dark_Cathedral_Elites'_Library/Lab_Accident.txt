The recent accident in the laboratories did not interrupt the poison brewing in a considerable way. The loss of the head alchemist makes it necessary to ask for a replacement though. Although the remaining alchemists have to work twice as hard as before, everything went fine so far. Still, I have to admit that working overtime makes new accidents more likely, but I decided to take that risk until a replacement arrives.
