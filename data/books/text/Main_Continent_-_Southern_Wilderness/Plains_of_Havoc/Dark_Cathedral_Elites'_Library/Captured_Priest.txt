That captured priest should be eliminated as soon as possible. It is far too dangerous to hold her captive for several reasons. I understand that the headquarter wants her interrogated but I am sure we did our best and this woman knows nothing of value. Regardless of my superiors' fears, I am convinced that she was investigating on her own here and not on some mission for our enemies.
