I am doomed! I know that Hugo lurks somewhere in the bushes in the North. I won't survive his deadly breath which would kill even the mightiest warrior! I have no clue how to trick the infamous Hugo but there has to be a way! Perhaps alchemy is the key to success. I will mix these two potions I bought from the travelling dwarf. We'll see what is going to happen. Perhaps it makes me invulnerable to the deadly breath! Then the secrets of the Nightmare Knights are at my grasp.
