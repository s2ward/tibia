We tracked Goshnar's daughter to the gates of Carlin but lost her within the city. Of course we got no help by the 'authorities', so I think she could hide there somewhere. It's likely that the brotherhood of bones has agents in the city that gave her shelter. We think she doesn't know her father's secrets though. Her magic tricks seemed quite ordinary to us. I can't say whether the rumour that she is pregnant is true. If so, nothing is known about the father of this child. Considering that Goshnar was allied with darkness we must fear the worst. So the search for Fermubras continues.
