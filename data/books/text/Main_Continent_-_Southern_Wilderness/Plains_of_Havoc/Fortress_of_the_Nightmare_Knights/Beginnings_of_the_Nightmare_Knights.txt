We changed this remote monastery into a small fortress to guard our new secrets. There is much to learn and by now we only understand little of the secrets the elves have taught us. Our dreams are not bright and revitalising as the ones the elves told us about but full of dark omens. We have to learn how to interpret them adequately. The green plains in which we reside are sometimes dangerous. Therefore, we will soon allow fighters to join our group. Some suggested to form a formally order to further our cause. The conclave will discuss this in the next meeting.
