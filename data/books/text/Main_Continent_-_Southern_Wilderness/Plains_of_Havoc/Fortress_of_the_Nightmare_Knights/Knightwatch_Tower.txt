The sorcerers insist that the Knightwatch Tower is a powerful tool for our order. I don't understand what they are talking about but the conclave has ordered to spend more of our resources in the construction of the tower. I think the whole idea of building our bases here and not near the city is a bad idea. Regardless of what they think, the dreams might tell about the significance of this place. I don't see anything to guard here and I wonder if there is something to guard at all. Our presence here just draws unwanted attention to this place. Settlers have already built a little outpost west of here; as if we had not already enough to do without the extra burden to protect them.
