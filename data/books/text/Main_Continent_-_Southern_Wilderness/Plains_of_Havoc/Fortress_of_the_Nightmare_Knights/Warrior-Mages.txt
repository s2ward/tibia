The weapon trainer is not pleased with the progress of the mages. The bodies of the sorcerers and druids are not trained enough to stand his lessons as long as they should to improve adequately. On the other hand, the knights and the paladins adopt to the ways of magic too slowly to see any progress above a certain given point. So we will stick to the concept of the four ways and drop the idea of the warrior-mages for now. Perhaps in the future we might find another way to combine the skills of arms and magic in some way.
