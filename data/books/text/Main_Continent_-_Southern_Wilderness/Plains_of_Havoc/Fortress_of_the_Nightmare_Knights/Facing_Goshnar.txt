The time of war is at hand. At last we will face Goshnar the evil one! The man that was formerly known as my brother Falnus betrayed our order, humanity and the gods. We will punish him and his unholy allies. Now there is no truning back. We will fight and there is just death or victory. Surrender or truce is no option! Even if the seven are on his side we will win at last and may it cost the lives of all of us! No mercy for evil! With sword and magic, with honour and virtue, for king and country!
