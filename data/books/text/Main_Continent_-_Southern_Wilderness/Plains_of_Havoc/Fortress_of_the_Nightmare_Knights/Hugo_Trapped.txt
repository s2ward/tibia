At last we trapped Hugo in the dungeon cellars! The beast killed two dozen of our members in a wild chase. After a painful and long hunt, our mages kept Hugo occupied with some summoned dragons that distracted him long enough to prepare the trap. When Hugo followed the 'track' we laid for him, our druids trapped him with plant barriers and then moved earth around him. Now the beast is trapped. May Fardos, Uman and Banor give that we can keep him satiated and calm by using the trick the druids figured out. Our aspirants will have a hard time to pass the test that was created around this beast.
