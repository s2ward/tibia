The Dream Challenge is far too easy, all riddles can be easily solved if you have some knowledge about our ways, are a good observer and use your brain. Therefore, the conclave decided to add some real danger to the test to make it a real challenge. The major problem by now is the Circle o.L. since it often requires a quest for the candidates, but that will change soon if the monsters are added as the conclave decided. I guess the knights who cried for this kind of challenge will get more than they bargained for.
