Our studies on the source of our dreams are not conclusive. The elves are no help in this matter. I doubt they even understand what we are asking them about because their dreams are so different from ours that there are almost no similarities. Some of our dreams are prophetic and a great help in fighting the evil. Some are so dark and desperate that they ruin the moral of the dreamer. Others are seductive and evil and try to lure the dreamer to the dark side. Only the weak fall prey to that seduction and that makes efficient testing of candidates important. So we will continue to use the dreams as guidance but have to remain vigilant for the sake of our spirits and souls.
