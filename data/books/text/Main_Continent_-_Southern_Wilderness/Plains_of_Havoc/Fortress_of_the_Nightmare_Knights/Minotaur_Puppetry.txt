Today our scout party returned from the city of the minotaurs. As we were told in our dreams, they are not our true enemies. There is a secret power behind their attacks, filling their hearts with lies about the other races. Someone or something is abusing them. Even though their attacks are surly just a diversion for something far more sinister and dangerous, our dreamers can't figure out the true cause for all these fights. I think it is crucial to parley with high ranking minotaurs about a truce. If we don't stop to waste resources on this useless war, we won't be ready for the real attack of the enemy.
