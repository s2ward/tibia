For our deeds for king and country, the king granted our order the Eastern lands. The city under our protectorate is growing and will soon be as big and as beautiful as our capital. But there is much work to do and countless monsters to slay to bring peace to the green planes. Some days ago, Falnus vanished and we must reckon that he is dead, probably murdered by the brotherhood. Of course even a mage of his power could have been slain by a greater number of creatures as dangerous as giant spiders that still roam these plains. It's a hard blow to our researches in the arts of healing and recreations and the loss of a great man.
