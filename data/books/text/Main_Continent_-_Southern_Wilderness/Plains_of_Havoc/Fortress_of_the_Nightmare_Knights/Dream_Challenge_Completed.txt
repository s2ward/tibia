The Dream Challenge is completed now. I am glad to be a member already, I doubt I could pass this test myself. Although most problems have to be solved by intellect, the demons they  summoned frighten me to death. Maybe we had to add something like this to ensure that no one passes the tests just by being told how it works. Still, adding a bunch of powerful monsters seems like madness to me. As if Hugo wasn't dangerous enough already!! I wonder where this all might lead us ...
