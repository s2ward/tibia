It is certain now! We are doomed. I have not the heart to tell it our remaining brothers and sisters, but the dreams were clear as seldom before: our order will be wiped out by the hand of time soon. But at least there is also some hope. The same dream that told us about our doom, hold a promise. In Tibia's darkest hour our order will return and once again battle the forces of evil; and a new generation will lead our order to greater glory than
ever. May those who will come not fall prey to the same evil as we did.
