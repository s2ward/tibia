I can't figure out how to reanimate
dragons and other monsters yet. 
I am sure the secret was hidden by 
this ancient knightly order after they 
defeated Goshnar. 
I am also sure that the 'thing' called 
'necromants nectar' is crucial to 
find the secret entrance to the Pits 
of Inferno. And what is the meaning of 
the phrase 'feed those in need', which 
I discovered in the ancient scrolls of my 
former master, before he hid them from me. 
I have to find them or figure out the secret 
on my own. I will never share my secrets and the success with the brotherhood, 
but now 
that the summoning of Urgith went wrong I 
have to spend to much time in fighting the 
undead back that are out of control. 
But now, after all what I did allready to 
become the new necromant king, I can't give 
up and i will not. Never!
The secrets of death will be mine! MINE!
