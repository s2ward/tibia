The Astral Shapers are an extinct race that is mentioned in several texts of other races that also existed back then. Usually they are referred to as greedy imbuers which suggests that the other races harboured no love for them. Yet, their skills in charging items with magical energy must have been of some value to the others. It seems they prospered for a while, selling their craft. At some point though, the other races decided to take what they needed by force and thereby destroyed the entire race. Some texts hint that the Shapers preferred to sacrifice themselves and to detonate their forges, rather than letting them fall into the hands of others. Other forges were destroyed when trying to lift their secrets. Again others were dismantled by Shapers in order to protect them from the wrong hands. Some were simply stolen, only to learn that all but the simplest of them had stopped working. As for the Astral Shapers, they were used by their captors as some kind of magical truffle pig for a while. However, since their spirit was broken, the race as such perished and eventually died out.
