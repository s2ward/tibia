Diary of Hengis Wulfson
...
I can only hope I can escape the 
cyclopes someday. For now I have 
occupied their chief with an attempt 
to learn to read and write, but for 
how long?
I'm so desperate. 
What a foolish idea to travel here to 
search the famous treasures of this 
ancient, knightly order. 
I wish I had never heard about it. 
I wish I never had sung thant song.
No clue how many unfortunate souls I have lured to death with it.
