Dear Muriel!
My apprentice behaves strangely lately.
I fear he has something evil in mind.
He must have stolen the books about
necromancy you were missing after
our last visit but I have no proof yet.
Thank the gods he does not know about
the fountain of life and the caves of
inferno yet. I will send Laira to town in
some days. I think she's in danger
if I'm right about Porgol.
Your friend,
Arcian
