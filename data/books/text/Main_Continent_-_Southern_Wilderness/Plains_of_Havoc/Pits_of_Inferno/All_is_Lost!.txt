All is lost!
Porgol assassinated my beloved husband. I could flee him here using my secret knowledge of the entrance. The lever is crusted with rust and does not work, but if I return Porgol's undead will rip me into pieces. May the gods forgive me, what I will do now. At least I will be reunited with Arcian soon.
