This is the Journal of Krendorak,
the last of the Nightmare Knights:
I tried to discover the secret of my ancestors, but I failed. 
The damned dragons tricked me! 
I escaped but I know I'm mortaly wounded. 
Even if I could get out off here, I will never make it to Knightwatch Tower to 
use its secret to resupply.
Since now that Camdrek is dead I will never be able to open it...
It is so hot, my sight is fading...
May the gods forgive my failing...
