Herbs and Plants of the Swamp, Volume II
Blood Herb (herba budinia)
A plant with large, dark red-colored blossoms.
It is nearly extinct due to its lack of strength - the herb can only survive
in the shade, and often only by draining nitrates from trees, which die in the 
process. Therefore, those plants can been found near or sometimes even on the 
inside of dead trees.
Goat Grass (flos capre)
A low, nearly always four-leaved plant with yellow blossoms that grows in warm 
climate. It used to be the main source of food for the goats of the continent. 
However, later it was discovered to have a previously totally unknown poisenous
long-term effect on the animals, and all goats died within two months.
