There is a whole family of those Bonelords here. They do not seem to mind me..
I often have strange dreams in which those creatures talk to me using their eyes. But those are only nightmares for sure.
I found a small underground stream where I can get water from, so I can survive down here.
I've given up hope for my men to come looking for me. Pah, humans.. they are probably not even thinking about me anymore.
