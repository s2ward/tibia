What I thought to be digging men are in fact strange green creatures with many arms or eyestalks, who can dig very fast. I think they are called "Bonelords".
They did not attack me yet, although I am sure they can sense me. Who knows, maybe they have no interest in me, and I can use their tunnels to get out of here? I will not attack them, unless I have to defend myself.
I stopped counting the days, because I lost all feeling for time down here.
Oh, how I long to see humans again!
