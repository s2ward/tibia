Day 1
There was an earthquake today, and it seems that the house sunk into the swamp. All people left in panic - there's noone left to open the locked cellar door for me and let me out! I tried yelling for help and smashing the door, but to no avail...
I decided to try to dig a tunnel to the surface.. luckily there are food and water supplies here, so I can survive for a few weeks. I hope I can make it.
