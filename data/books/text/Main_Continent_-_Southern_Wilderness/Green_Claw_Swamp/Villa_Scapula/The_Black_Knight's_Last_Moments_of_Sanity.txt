I hate all humans! I will build a home and stay underground forever, they don't deserve my return!
The Bonelords are my only friends. They respect me. I belong to them now. In my dreams they have shown me the path to this underground base. When I sleep I can hear them whispering in my mind promises about eternal existence and immortality. My friends can feel my hunger for revenge on humanity and will supply me with the means to punish them and all living beings.
Never again I will wear that fancy armor and black shall be the color of my revenge.
