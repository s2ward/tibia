Now we have two enemies!
Being defeated by the evil humans we are forced to retreat into new caves. Our plan to create a tunnel to the eastern caves of this world is nearly completed!
But the dark minotaurs will protect their caverns. And our tunnel will go straight through their homes. So we must fight against both humans and minotaurs.
