Chronicle of Mintwallin - the city of the Minotaurs
written by Markwin, king of all (?) Minotaurs
Volume V
I don`t understand it, but the outcasts must have a way into our city Mintwallin. Today a group of them murdered my son Ian and some of my guards. I am deadly ill. I am coughing blood. I am full of sorrow. And I am tired. So tired. I can not defend my own city.
My mage told me the coming of another threat. Some humans have killed the dragon and are advancing to our gates. I hope they won`t find the way through the labyrinth.
