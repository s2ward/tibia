I wonder how Ronur is doing. I miss him.
But its my duty as sorceress of the nightmare knights to protect our bases here far away from home. Soon I will visit him and we will be reunited again. If all works like planned our marriage will take place in the end to this year.
I hope this bitch Shandra will be kept busy by her studies in the mage guild and does not try to use my absence for one of her dirty tricks. She does not deserve a man like Ronur.
