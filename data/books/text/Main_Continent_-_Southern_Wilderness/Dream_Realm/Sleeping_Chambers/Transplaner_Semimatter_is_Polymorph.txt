... we see the transplaner semimatter is polymorph and the time constant is a contradiction in cases of subliminal manafocusing of the first grade. This implies that the vector of interisomatic transfixture has a mana to semimatter ratio of t*m-RM. So if the hyperelasticity of NM is defined as shown in previous volumes, we derive a transpeherical aethertransfixion of t-RU. This is no surprise to even the most simple minded rune user but the real implication of this is ...
