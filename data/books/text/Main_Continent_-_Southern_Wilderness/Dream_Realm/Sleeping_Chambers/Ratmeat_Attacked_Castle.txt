The necromancer called Ratmeat has led an attack on the castle.
These undeads used the sewers to launch a surprise attack. Our reinforcements arrived last-minutely and we were able to kill Ratmeat as well as the ones known as Maggotfeast and Wormskin. Only Ratfeast has shown signs of the transformation. So I conclude that the others must have been members of no importance and without any real powers. They used the same runes we have seen on members of the brotherhood before. It is likely that they got them from higher ranking members that traded their souls for forbidden secrets.
