Banor bless me with deafness!
This snoring dwarf is driving me nuts. Will this ever stop? One day, I will kill either him or myself. I can't believe the others can sleep, dream training or not!
I wonder if I would become deaf by putting my head in a cauldron and using an explosion rune. Then again, I should perhaps put HIM in a cauldron and use some explosions ...
I am sure he will lure a dragon here that thinks this awful noise is a mating call.
Tomorrow, I will try to get an assignment at Knightwatch Tower. Even that windy hole is better than THIS!
