It is important for a dreamwalker not to get lost in his dreams. To accomplish that you have to train your senses. You must become aware that you are dreaming without waking up. To train this, get accustomed to asking yourself : 'Am I awake?' Do this at daytime as often as possible. But be careful! Do not conclude too quickly that you are awake. Try to 'fly' just on your thoughts, try to change the world around you by sheer imagination. Take some time to test reality.
At some point of that training you will use this routine in your sleep as well. Then it is essential to come to the conclusion that you are asleep! If you have accomplished that, you will have a hard time to balance between dreaming and awakening. At first you will often slip back in the dream state but that will change quickly. Then you can begin the art of dreamwalking.
