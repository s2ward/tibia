Nightmares are not your enemies. Make them to your teachers. Learn about them. Understand them. If it is a repeated nightmare, think about it while awake. Think about a good ending for that dream, imagine this ending again and again, feel comfortable with this happy ending. Enjoy it. Have fun with it and the nightmare will lose its sting. This way you can train yourself to dream the positive ending.
Sometimes it is helpful to write your dreams down. Don't try to analyse them. You will get used to understand them just by reading and reliving them. It's not necessary to force something. This could even be harmful! Understand them as a nice story someone told you. Enjoy them and think about how they could continue. Imagine what would have happened if something like this happens in real life. Your dreams are your friends. All of them!
