Evil often seems invincible, but even the longest journey begins with a first little step. It is up to us to say 'NO' to evil and to deny it the space it needs to blossom. We might fear it, but it cannot scare us. We might be weaker, but in the end evil will lose. Evil is hollow and self-consuming. Nothing can warm up the cold hearts of evil beings, nothing can fill the loneliness. A life so centred on itself cannot be shared with others. If you do not share your life, you deny it. Life is sharing. No one can cope with life alone. You have to share your life to give birth. You have to share to feel your life. Evil beings do not feel life, so they destroy it. Evil cannot understand life, and things that cannot be understood are feared.
