In the realm of dream, dreams literally can become true. So mind your thoughts when entering the dream realm. A uncontrolled thought can easily bring disaster upon you. Self-control is most important for any dreamwalker. Calmness and clear thought will guide and shield the dreamer. You will encounter in the dreams what you take in there with you. Don't try to enforce a prophecy, it won't work. Wander the dreams and if a prophecy comes to you, take it as a gift.
