The weapon was hidden well. We ensured that only a hero of courage and an unstained soul can find it.
The unholy place will be guarded by our order. If its necessary, we will guard it eternally.
No magic will be able to discover the secrets now.
We used powerful enchantments and all the tricks our brightest minds have came up with. There will be no way to trick our wards or to disenchant them. I am confident that, combined with the riddles and traps, our forces will fight back all evil that might challenge us. Even the Ruthless Seven themselves if necessary.
