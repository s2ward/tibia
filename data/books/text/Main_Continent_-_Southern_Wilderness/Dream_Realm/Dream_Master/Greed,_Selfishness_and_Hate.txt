Greed, selfishness and hate are the soil that gives birth to evil. You can't neglect these feelings since they are part of you. But you can understand them. To understand why you hate someone will give you a deeper understanding how to cease to hate. Sometimes, you may have to kill someone. Do never kill somebody out of hate. Only kill to prevent a greater evil.
You also have to understand your positive feelings. They are your shield to protect you from the assaults of negative emotions. They are the blanket that keeps you warm in desperate times. As long as you follow the path that these positive emotions show you, there is nothing that can harm YOU. They can hurt your body but your immortal soul is beyond their grasp.
