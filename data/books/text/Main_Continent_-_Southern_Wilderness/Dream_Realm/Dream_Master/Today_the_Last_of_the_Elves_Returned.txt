Today the last of the elves returned to their home town. They left us alone to battle the undead hordes. What a cowardly race! Without their aid, many of our best men will die. I don't understand these sages that asked me to see also the elves' point of view. All I see are the the mothers and fathers that will ask me where their children are when they have died in the upcoming battle. It is almost certain that our messenger, who was sent to the dwarfs and the king, is dead. There will be no reinforcements. We will have to fight on our own. I am sure we will win, but at what cost?
