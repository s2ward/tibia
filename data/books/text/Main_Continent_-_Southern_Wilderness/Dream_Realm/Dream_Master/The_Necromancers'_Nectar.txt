What an irony, the necromancers' nectar is the key to our doom and to our victory. Only he who feeds those in need will gain entrance, which is ironic too, because the forces of evil will never consider to do such a thing, no matter how gruesome it truly is.
There is no way that the entrance is revealed but by treachery. Therefore, we have to keep the number of people who know about the secret as low as possible. Only the most trusted members will learn about the ritual. I can only hope there is no other high ranking traitor like Goshnar.
