When the tower falls,
when the cold loses its sting,
when the small walks the halls of the great,
when the lord of murder loses his nobility,
when the ice kisses the fire,
when the arrow will not fly twice,
when the thunder silences the mute,
when the red meets the green on golden ground,
when the ivory is broken by the blood-stained hand,
when the dead walk on earth and laugh at the gods,
when the names will be erased and the vanished return,
when the forbidden twin no longer exists,
when the one-eyed king dies in fire,
when the traitor meets his fate,
then excalibug will be reborn in the flame of justice.
