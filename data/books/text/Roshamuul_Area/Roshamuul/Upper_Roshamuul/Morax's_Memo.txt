Memo to myself: Read this thoroughly after having come back from the first trip to the north!
1. Make sure not to be possessed by demons. Check for obvious signs and perform cleansing rites if necessary.
2. Go back to camp to catalog items found and consult with brothers.
3. Do not test items on yourself before having complied with 2. ! (Remember reprimand from Sandomo concerning unauthorized field work!)
4. Burn this note.
