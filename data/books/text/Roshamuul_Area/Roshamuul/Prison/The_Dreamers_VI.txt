The nightmare creatures, fed with the sheer energy unleashed, were literally burning with power. The energy was too much for them. Several had fused into even more grotesque creatures, some of them spawning lesser horrors over and over, until they dissolved. But their increased power had brought down many of the subdued princes. Demons who had previously fled the carnage caused by the princes closed in, like Zitraks smelling blood. They swarmed over the fallen princes with ravenous force.
Not more than ten or so of our treacherous allies had survived the slaughter, but their minions were seemingly in endless supply. I had not been aware they had brought so much backup forces into our city.
I was confused. Still I could not feel anything and stumbled through the streets that were distorted by what I imagined a storm of unbound dreams. 
When I found shelter, the sound of battle in the city already grew fainter.
I looked down to see that my body was mutilated and my life force sapping out. But that was something I welcomed.
My tiredness in mind is now shared with this body. I would not create a new one, even if I could.
I will allow things to run their course. I will sink into the eternal dream.
To finally let go.
Once again be one with the dreams, riding above the plains of nightmare on the howling winds.
It is so long ago that I have done that.
There was always something to do, something to take care of, an ambition to be fulfilled.
If I'd only had dreamed a bit more. Instead of chasing goals that were not even mine.
Everything is futile.
But this is not.
I imagine this text will survive the ravages of time. It will find its way to people who can understand.
It is not that futile when it is preserved.
I'm so tired.
I will rest now. Finally.
