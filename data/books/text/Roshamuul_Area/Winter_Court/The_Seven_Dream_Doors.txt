There are seven Dream Doors in the Labyrinth of Summer's and Winter's Dreams: The Rose Door, the Invisible Door, the Stone Door, the Painted Door, the Ice Bird Door, the Skull Door and the Empty Door. For each door, a version survived the long history of the dream elves:

"Gather the lonely maiden with her sisters to open the Door of Roses."

"Only in a ghostly light the Invisible Door will come into view."

"Petrified for centuries, the Stone Door can be passed only with the help of its curse's blood."

"Turn surface into space, transform imagination into reality and you may pass the Painted Door."

"Only the scent of liquorice, raspberries, pepper and fish will open the Ice Bird Door."

"Three lonely misadventurers, long forgotten, waiting for what the Skull Door goats. Beware: The first try will also be your last!"

"The Empty Door obeys the logic of dreams: What seals another door might open this one."
