(You see a page from a diary, barely legible. You decipher the last passage:)
Well, I should have known this was a stupid idea. But when Rotem Valos said that he needed some desert-proof men for that cartography job of his, I like the old silly fool I am didn't hesitate to volunteer. Now I've lost the other two in this stupid desert storm, and my water bottle's empty. And then these strange statues and ruins the storm revealed. They give me the creeps.
I went to see if there was water, but those creatures there are like out of my worst nightmare! And they almost had a good bite out of me, too. They swatted me like a fly. I barely made it back to here. But the heat outside is unbearable. I guess I'm safe here, at the entrance. I'll just have to sit it out and hope someone finds me in time. And I must make sure nobody goes further in. No-one can survive this.
