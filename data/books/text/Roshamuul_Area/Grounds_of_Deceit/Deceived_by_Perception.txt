Make right whatever your perception made wrong.
Grass cannot feed such maws and barren wastes are no pasture.
Oceans of sand cannot be digged and mud will swallow the most dangerous beings.
Cold will kill the cold bloods and the jungle heat will harm the warm.
Dimensions off world are strange to some and others prefer the dark.
And in the end you will see this through.
