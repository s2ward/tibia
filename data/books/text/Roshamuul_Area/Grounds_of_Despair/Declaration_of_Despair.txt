Declaration of Despair, by a nameless Bureaucrat

Despair turns a mind in itself. Everything is engulfed, all thoughts and cravings eaten up by it. The mind becomes focused on but one single thing, a stage of all the workings of a desperate soul, until it is worn out by the course of the dead ends, blunted by the rusty blades of inadequate means, chokes on loneliness, and finally dies on the dreary shores of hopelessness.
That is why, once despair has taken hold in a soul, it will feed on itself; denying help and drawing other souls to its pitchblack abyss of a mind. There despair may take hold of the other souls, too, for the Lord of Despair is ever hungry, and no one can withstand him for long. Hail Pumin!
