To make the blood well pour anew, four long forgotten symbols of downfall and tragedy shall be consulted: the desecrated angel, the fallen knight, the failing guardian and the child of darkness. They will tell you what gifts may open the gate to the lower tunnels. Offer the four sacrifices to the well, standing in front of the candles, then douse a sacred statue's flame. At last recite the Rite of Eternal Night at the well's rim.
