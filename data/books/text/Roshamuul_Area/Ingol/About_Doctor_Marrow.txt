When I joined doctor Marrow on his secret island, I had my hopes high to work with one of the greatest living minds on a project to further humanity. Yet soon I had to learn the bitter truth, that doctor Marrow is a madman. A genius for sure, yet his ethics and goals are not even questionable but outright evil.
He plans to create the perfect creature. But it's more about creating the perfect servants what he really is doing. He might have had more noble goals in mind when he started out but in the course of his experiments he got further and further away from the ethics that might have once guided him.
It began with the vivisection of creatures like minotaurs and after that his own creations. Later I learned of the test subjects he acquired. First we were told they were criminals and crazy people. But I learned that most of the poor souls have been abducted. Homeless, poor, villagers and the like.
He not only tempered with their body but also their brains to make them see some mixture of pack leader and god in him. And indeed playing god seemed to become his favourite pastime more and more. The unscrupulous experiments, his disregard for his test subjects and even the creatures he eventually created were just disgusting.
I will try to flee this island and expose him to the public.
