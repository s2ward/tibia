It is unacceptable, that the doors to the lower laboratories can only be used if the machine core is properly charged. Dr. Marrow's constant use of his teleportation device makes him oblivious of our predicaments and he won't listen. Our makeshift arrangement of machines to recharge the core on our own is complicated at best. To direct the energy on the core is tricky at best and the room is under constant electrical charge. If it weren't for the discharger unit that is built into the floor, no one could stay there for a longer period of time. My only hope is, to reason with Dr. Marrow when he is in an uncommonly good mood.
