This room. It pains me. No windows, air... a feeling of dread. I feel I can't breathe. There is a door, it disappears. It appears. It disappears and no air. No room to breathe. The walls are dark, black... they absorb the most insignificant beam of light. Darkness. Yet I can see perfectly clear. This room is very bright. And no air. It gets harder to breathe. Or is it just me? How long have I been here? I don't dare pass the door. It will close once I... the breathing, it gets harder. Need to concentrate. The door is tempting. I will not succumb. A lock. And a key. I will tie myself to the wall. Until I can concentrate again. Until I am myself again. Throw away the key. Stay put. The true exit will reveal... itself.
