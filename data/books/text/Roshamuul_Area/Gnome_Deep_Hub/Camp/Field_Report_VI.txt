Field Report VI
After we encountered the accursed 'lost' in the ranks of the enemy, I'm fully in support of the emperor's decision to make a stand against the forces opposing us. We must not allow those living mockeries of all that is good and dwarfish to push us true dwarves out of our claimed areas. I'm pleased to hear out gnomish allies pledged their support to our course and sending resources and experts to our aid - as long as they don't get in the way of my warriors.
I reached an agreement with the gnomish emissary that we dwarves oversee the military aspects of the campaign, while the gnomes assist us with supplies, logistics and intelligence - I still don't get it, what about this makes the gnomish emissary giggle uncontrollably every time I mention it.
