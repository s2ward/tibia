Field Report II
After a first test dig hit a system of natural cave system we have to reconsider our stance.
Some of the prospectors were leading first mining operations on a smaller scale to verify the direction of the most prosperous ore veins.
By doing that, two of them hit huge caves that seemingly stretched through the whole area. We easily found obvious signs of previous occupation by the usual array of subterranean creatures that could be expected in this depths but strangely enough encountered nothing alive nor found any bodies.
Taking the gnomish intelligence reports into consideration, I decided to keep things save and established defensive perimeters, switching a whole crew of miners to guard duties. I have ordered the prospectors to survey the area for any form of hostile life. My experience tells me things down there are too quiet to be trusted.
