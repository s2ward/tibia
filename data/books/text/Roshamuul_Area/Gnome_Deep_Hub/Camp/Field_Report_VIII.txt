Field Report VIII
The standstill we earned is obviously only temporarily. The attacks have been reduced in frequency and ferocity but continue. Whether the enemy is gathering new forces or waiting for new orders, now is the time to act. We have to use that little breathing space we won by fighting back to bring the battle to the enemy. The gnomes managed to gain vital intelligence on the enemy and we made our own observations in the fights. The major figures on the hostile side are seemingly several leaders that, aside from being a lethal threat on their own, served as some kind of rallying spot for the enemies armies.
A certain three of them have been identified as crucial for the efforts of 'those below'.
Lacking proper alternative names the boys have named the incomprehensible creatures after likewise incomprehensible titles of human nobility. They are identified as the Count of the Core, the Duke of the Depths and the Baron from Below. As long as we can put enough pressure on them, the attacks might be kept at a manageable rate. It is vital though, that we strike soon and strike hard.
There are several more formidable creatures in the ranks of the enemy but they seem more like loners and encounters with them are rare. It seems wise to avoid them when possible and let special strike teams handle them if the need arises.
Given that the gnomes are more familiar with the enemy, it might be possible that they are not exaggerating when they claim that the enemy is prepared to utilise even worse methods to annihilate our defences. If they are right, the enemy plans to flood our tunnels with lava and that is a threat no axe nor steel could hope to fight.
