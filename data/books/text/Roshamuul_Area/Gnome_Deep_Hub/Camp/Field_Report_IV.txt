Field Report IV
While the reinforcement of our position is in progress, the scouting party begins sweeps of the cave system. Right now they only encountered some lonely formerly unknown creatures that were highly aggressive but posed not too much of a threat. Especially none that could explain the disappearance of a whole experienced and well-armed team of prospectors and miners. We have to assume that the creatures encountered are only stragglers and part of more numerous and formidable packs. I have secured some corpses of those beasts and sent them to our gnomish allies for examination. Perhaps they already encountered such creatures.
