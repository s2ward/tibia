Field Report III
A whole scouting party has gone missing. Given that no tectonic activity was noticed, it has to be assumed that they encountered hostile forces and security measurements have to be enacted according to dwarfish standard procedure. The miners were pulled back and provisional camps have been disbanded. We established defensive holds at several chokepoints and secured the base. Everyone is switched to guard duties and word was sent for reinforcements.
As soon as the reinforcements arrive, a well equipped scouting party will estimate the situation and look for survivors of the lost team.
