(You see what appears to be a large diary. It is covered with giant scrawls that are often blotched and nearly unreadable, as if written by hands unused to holding a pen)
Day 4 - I have contacted the Stantons through my loyal messenger Maro. Maybe a spell, a rune, a potion can heal me? I hope Emily is fine and does not worry too much, I have been gone for several days now... Perhaps I should write to her? But what do I tell her? That this... hide is covering my skin as to make me unable to touch her? Oh no no, I cannot do this. I cannot let her see me, imagine me like this! Better to leave her in doubt than this horrible knowledge. Alaistar has promised to look after her. That must be enough for now. Oh, how I long to shed these vile scales that cover my skin!
...
Day 35 - The Stantons know of no potion or spell that can cure me. I am doomed to stay here until I find an antidote. Luckily, I have, at least for now, all I need to conduct the necessary experiments; it was a lucky hunch that led me to build the particle accelerator here instead of in the factory! Who knows, maybe this transformation put me on the lead to a new invention? But if yes, which one, to what end? I cannot think why anyone should wish to look and feel as grossly confined in this massive, ogrish body as I do. Oh, to be human again!
...
Day 46 - At least I do not need sleep in this brutish form, but how I wish there was some human company! And what about Emily? ... I must not dwell on these thoughts. I must find a cure. I must!
...
Day 61 -  The salve only thickened this horrible hide that covers and deforms my body. But I cannot give up. I must think of Emily. I have written some letters to make sure our family fortune will not be withheld from her, but will my family, will Carefew have accepted those letters as my own? I must ask my messenger about the news from above.
...
Day 65 - This is disastrous! Maro says that my letters were not accepted, that Carefew said they were frauds! FRAUDS! How dare he! He cannot deny it is my sigil, but he says my writing has been forged. FORGED! By the gods above and below! Has he lost all decency, to leave Emily bereft of what is rightly hers? Oh, the infamy! But I see how it is. Carefew has never been a friend of mine, and seeks revenge through vile attacks on my dearest. If only I could ascertain that my writing IS still unchanged! Oh, if only someone had old writings from me that I could study! But with these enormous hands, what is there to be done? Would devising a writing golem help? But oh no no, the golem could still not copy my style. This is wretched, wretched indeed!
...
Day 243 - I am near desperation. Maro has informed me he can no longer be my messenger to the world above. Will this torment never end?
...
Day 352 - Another failure. I can't get the recipe to work. Oh my dearest Emily, will I ever see you again?
...
Day 456 - I am on the lead of something. I think it may be the mixture of gases that caused the chain reaction in the factory. Maybe if I can reverse the effect?
...
Day 581 - After weeks of endless tests, I must conclude that gases were a dead end. Nothing worked. Maybe not a potion, but a slowly dissolving pill or lozenge? If the ingredients were to release their effects step by step, internally, would they reduce this thick, hideous hide? Must research.
...
Day 876 - Maybe tonight I will finally have the breakthrough, I feel it is within my grasp! The latest experiments have been very promising. Oh Emily... wait for me, my darling.
...
Day 1001 - I must not, I cannot give up! There must be a way to undo this! Maybe I have been wrong to indulge in this diary. I shall leave the days uncounted from now on, and only think of my goal. All I need now is a messenger. Time will show me a way, I am certain of it. Oh Emily, my love. My thoughts are with you, always.
