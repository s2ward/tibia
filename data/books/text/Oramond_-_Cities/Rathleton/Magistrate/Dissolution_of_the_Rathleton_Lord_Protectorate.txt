By the rules of the lord protectorate itself I, Humlin Otherford, sentence the reigning Lord Protector Iridin Steelson to death by burning, for being guilty of witchcraft, blood magic and murder. Furthermore, in the name of the people I declare that the title of Lord Protector is no longer. Having seen the atrocities that always corrupt and defile any leadership eventually, we, the people, declare that henceforth no single ruler shall be granted the right of reign over our realm.
From now on a body of chosen spokespersons will rule over city and realm. In their decisions they are obliged to follow the vote of selected people that have proven their dedication to our cause through their actions.
