The Big Book of Glooth Pt.2
First dismissed as useless, Hergis Brunt, inventor and visionary in the field of mechanics, used the properties of gloothine in the creation of his first brunt-machines. With the spread of glooth usage the demand for the slime grew to an extent where the worm farms could not keep up. Progress was stunted for several decades before a group of scientists made a breakthrough in breaking down garbage of glooth products into the basic slime they were originally made of. Others dedicated their research to finding some use for the by-products of glooth creation. Glooth spice and glooth pudding found their way into the homes of even the poorest to supply them with new glooth-born strength.
With increased reusability and more efficient worm farms and better worm breeding, the supply of glooth was once again secured, but it showed that overdependence was a danger. Efforts to gain other resources were renewed and increased. Still, the glooth inventions flourished even when experiments with other catalysts than energy and to some degree heat, met with little substantial results and ended up as an often mocked side note of science.
In our days it is hard to imagine what a world without glooth would look like. Our day begins when we clean our teeth with a gloothbrush and ends when we lay down in our beds with a glooth casting. This is something the glooth critics readily ignore in their unfounded rants against glooth, whenever they come up with their horror scenarios in which the glooth suddenly reverts back to its slime state, drowning each and everyone in Rathleton in a wave of slime. Those ungrateful enemies of progress just argue for argument's sake and shouldn't be given the attention they are desperately looking for. The glooth has led us to an age of prosperity and progress, and there is no way for a sane person to go back into the dark ages before the glooth.
