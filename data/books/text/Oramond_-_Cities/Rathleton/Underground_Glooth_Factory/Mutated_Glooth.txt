My esteemed colleague,
we are very pleased to hear that your activities near Rathleton are flourishing. To be honest, at first we were more than suspicious as we learned that you are hiring a gang of criminals and have them do the more inconvenient tasks for you. But seemingly you are able to keep away from them the important information about your actual goals and intentions. Furthermore your succes in establishing a makeshift laboratory in the tunnels under Rathleton and even acquiring some novel glooth based weaponry speaks for itself. The mutated glooth you mentioned in your last letter is an interesting matter. Perhaps it is useable in an arcane way to enhance spells or improve potions. Even the creation of yet unknown artefacts could be possible. We think your endeavours are taking a good path.
With best regards
Uquora the High-Handed of the Circle of the Black Sphinx
