I discovered a buried temple or shrine, that must once have been part of a much bigger complex. I don't know what ancient culture could have built this nor whether it was a sanctuary, palace or something completely different. The main part of these ruins is a small place, accurately built of black and white tiles. In the centre is a big black stone figure, surrounded by four different statues. Each of them has an inscription, which gives a hint on what the statue wishes. I assume if one can fulfil all four wishes, something will happen, yet I don't know what this 'something' could be. I also noticed that the inscription on one of the statues became unreadable over time. Based on an old legend I assume, the last request could be: 'Adorn me.'
