Scientific Research Report by Georgia Rainbird:

Three months ago I discovered it for the first time: A strange kind of glooth, deep purple in colour and of a slightly different consistency than the glooth variant we knew until now. There are some pools or ponds of this glooth in the upper mushroom caves in the east of the tunnels. At the time of my researches these were the only ones, but I fear they are spreading. I assume, it is a kind of mutation that caused the glooth to change this way. I was very careful about my researches as I don't yet know all possible side effects of this mutated glooth variant. What I was able to determine is the following: The mutated glooth is a dangerous thing. It affects its environment in a clearly negative fashion. Some plants wither and rot under its influence, others mutate into toxic, sometimes even animated variants. Smaller cave dwellers as rats, toads and bugs are likewise affected by the side effects of the mutated glooth. They also evolve into poisonous, bigger and stronger variants of themselves. They show an increased aggressiveness and seem to infect other animals with their bite. These first observations lead me to believe that the glooth mutation down here has to be stopped. If it spreads out the danger for Rathleton or even Oramond could be immense.
