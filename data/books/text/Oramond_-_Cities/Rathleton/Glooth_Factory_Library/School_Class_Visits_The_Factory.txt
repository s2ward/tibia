Today a class from the Rathleton public school visited the plant. We raised security to the highest standards and even got lucky with a break in the constant attacks. Ironically, one of the youth was yet hurt as he was bitten by a tiny spider that hid in a canister with highly experimental glooth. Of course it has been nothing threatening and the kid is fine but it gave us all a good laugh.
