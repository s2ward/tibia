Meldry continues to claim that the glooth dust is hazardous to the health of the workers while it is obvious that the decline in health in the workforce is attributable to the misuse of self-distilled alcohol. In reaction to his protest from him, I ordered a swipe through the worker quarters and the confiscation of brewing equipment. This indeed silenced Meldry's complaints about him. Although he might only be silent for a while, because he recently had a not work-related accident and showed up for his shift bruised and limping.
