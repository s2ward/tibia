While under attack by the minotaurs, the leading scientist Shougust Tronkil has gone missing. The possibility that the minos got him can be dismissed. The minotaurs never made it that far and Tronkil insisted on continuing his work at the other end of the plant. With everyone distracted, something must have happened to him. Strangely enough the only thing that was left were his entire clothes at the place where he was working. There were no traces of a fight and considering the plant was locked up due to the attack, there was no place he could have gone. With Tronkil gone, his work on the glooth discharger frequency is stopped until we find a suitable replacement.
