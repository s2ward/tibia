Worker Thomas is still complaining that the machine at the glooth steam accelerator 'talks' to him. 'In his head of him', as he said. As a matter of fact he has been found sleeping between the machinery repeatedly, and one time even wandering aimlessly and probably under the influence of alcohol, wielding a sledge hammer. I request his removal and replacement.
