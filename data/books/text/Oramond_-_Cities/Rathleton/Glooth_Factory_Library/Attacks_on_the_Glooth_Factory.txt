The attacks on the plant are becoming more and more of a threat. While the plant was in construction they were only a nuisance but now that it is up and running all kind of wierd creatures seem to be drawn to it for what reason ever. In the case of the minotaurs it is easy to see what they are up to. They want to hurt the city badly and perhaps even overtake the plant and use it for their own. But they seem to be mostly motivated to deny the plant to Ratleton at all cost even if it means that they sacrifice their invading force to blew it up. The other creatures though - we have no idea what drives them into such a frenzy to attack the plant. Probably some of the machines it making a noise or vibration or whatever that drives them mad. Even more unsettling is the organized way of the attacks. As if even there is some driving force behind it. That might even be seen as possible for the automatons. Indeed someone could be creating and leading them from a distance, but why and how eludes us. But what of the beasts? What drives them to their ferocious attacks? Another question is how long we can stand those constant attacks and what might happen if we ultimately fail to repel them some day?
