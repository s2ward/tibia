The power conduits are under constant high pressure but yet they keep working. The request to run half of them only on 3/4 power and switch between 3/4 and full charge was denied. I won't accept any responsibility for possible consequences. How the harmonious dischargers can stand this constant strain is beyond me. Even more how their arrangement amplifies the energy even further. From all what I learned from my old master, this should be impossible. But somehow parts of the plant seem to bend what is impossible and what not. Yet it is obvious that the machinery is put into severe stress by all that power and the whole material is not capable of enduring that king of strain for a prolonged time. We frantically exchange parts in the rare downtimes of a sector, but I wonder if this will be enough to keep things going.
