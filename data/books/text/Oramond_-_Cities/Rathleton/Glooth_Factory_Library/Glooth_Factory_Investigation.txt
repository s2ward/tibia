As far as I was able to study the plans for the plant and watch things in work, I have to admit that its function is beyond my comprehension. Larger parts of the glooth application are done in formerly unseen ways. Most designs are so far apart from classic design that I wonder who in the world would come up with such concepts. I consider myself an expert in glooth machinery and yet I can't figure out how any team in Rathleton could create the designs which where used. Much of the work is attributed to the late professor Larington's team but I knew Larington, and though he was prominent with the city administration he was too much of a traditionalist to harbour such revolutionary ideas. Even more strange is the silence that is met with when you ask former team members about their work with Larington. At best you get some secrecy phrases but it's quite obvious how nervous most of them become when further pressed. Most of them are not as experienced and brilliant as I am anyway. So how could this old geezer and a bunch of dilettantes could create some plant that even I don't remotely understand? And what are they hiding at all? Some officials 'informed' me I should stick to my own business and my tasks at hand. It was suggested that further investigation would do no good to my scientific careerer. This makes me wonder even more, although I will keep my investigations less obvious from now on. One of the new workers is eyeing me suspiciously. I might become paranoid, but better safe than sorry - I will try to evade him in the future, and better hide these notes somewhere.
