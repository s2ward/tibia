- Finding a turtle in a grove of mahogany trees often is an omen of a heroic deed.
- Anyone wanting to curse a enemy should slay a raven at a crossroads after the first stars light the sky on the spring equinox and also needs the following: serpent heart, ginger roots, rose petals, hare skin and yew bark
- Priests wishing to divine the future must sacrifice a white goat upon an altar at midnight after the first thaw.
- Don't pray near a patch of veldt flowers at dawn.
