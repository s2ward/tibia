On Nagas

Nagas have the lower bodies of enormous snakes with a humanoid torso and head. They possess four arms and are able to use all of them simultaneously - be it to fish, weave, wield weapons or perform special gestures called yukti to cast spells. They typically hold their heads and torsos off the ground while moving, but they can increase their speed by lowering their bodies. On their torsos they like to wear beautiful silken clothes or ornate armour as well jewelry like rings, bracelets and bangles on their arms. The lower snake body is usually free of clothing, but will be protected with armour if necessary. Nagas are resistant to poison and have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic. Much like most snake and reptile species, they dislike cold climates.

Nagas are an old, powerful and proud race who live on the jungle island Marapur since several millennia and built up a remarkable culture there. Their cities are said to be filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures. Their power makes them potentially dangerous to humans. However, many of them act rather benevolent towards the two-legs, as they call the humanoid races. If they are hostile and aggressive, there is always a good reason, be it obvious or not.
