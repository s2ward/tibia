Geography of Kilmaresh
East of the strait that separates Kilmaresh from Krailos, there are mainly dry steppe regions. At the peninsula's centre lies a large mountain range and one will always discover small oases and tombs scattered over the steppe. In addition, there are many rock formations, interveined with blue ore. This ore can be magically crafted into a rare and precious metal that Sapphire Blade members use for their blades. A large river, the Nykri, rises in the central mountains and forms a fork halfway to the sea. Here lies the big city Issavi, the heart of Kilmaresh. The original capital Nuur was destroyed by Suon's Wrath.
Kilmaresh has a warm, dry climate. The temperatures are very high, especially in summer, and it does not rain much. However, this part od the continent is not plagued by the lack of water that crusts the lakes and rivers of Krailos with salt. In addition to the river Nykri, there are oases in the steppe, which house smaller settlements or stations for travellers.
Kilmaresh is mainly populated by humans. They have lived on this continent for several millennia and developed into the high culture, which now forms the eponymous Empire Kilmaresh. In the past, numerous enslaved ogres lived in Kilmaresh, but since Suon's Wrath and the collapse of the old empire, the ogres are found almost exclusively on Krailos. A single tribe still lives north of the ruined city Nuur. In addition, the magical creatures who call themselves the Anuma  live in Kilmaresh since forever. These include sphinxes, manticores, lamassu and griffins.
