Spiderweb Clouds
Spiderweb Clouds are a phenomenon which apparently exists only on Kilmaresh. Tangled strands of a spiderweb-like substance fill the sky like clouds do. It is unknown how those strands come into existence but it is a fact that airborne creatures which fly into a spiderweb cloud can become entangled there. This is why the Anuma detest this wheather phenomenon. Sometimes the clouds fall from the sky and cover the Kilmaresh steppe. Touching them is dangerous because the strands are poisonous and whoever passes the cloud rests can become entangled easily.
