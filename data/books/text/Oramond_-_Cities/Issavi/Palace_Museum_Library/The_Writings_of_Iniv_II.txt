The Writings of Iniv II.

So I called at the gates of Issavi. And behold, the golden gates opened and I was granted admission to the great city, the home of the Benevolent King, blessed by himself, the often sung about city Issavi, the glowing star of the steppe. And as I entered, my eyes became aware that the songs and poems had not betrayed me. With alabaster and white marble the streets were paved, each lined with date palms and pomegranate trees, heavy under the weight of their fruit. Each house measured more than three floors, from silk the curtains, which protected the inhabitants from sun and dust, like petals in all colors.
