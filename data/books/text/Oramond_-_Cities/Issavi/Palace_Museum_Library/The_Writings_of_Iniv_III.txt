The Writings of Iniv III.

Abundant with fountains, the city was full of scents from all parts of the continent: cinnamon and cloves, red and white pepper, rose oil, amber and myrrh, incense, ginger and nutmeg. And the wide road that lead from the Gate of Dawn to the palace was lined with dozens of statues, made of marble and gold, each a hymn to the King Suon, whose blessing let Issavi flourish. And when I reached the Hanging Gardens of Meketre, it was with great humility and awe that I saw the glory of the city, which they called the King's Golden House and which had survived all the fires of destruction.
