The Writings of Iniv IV.

And so came the day of the highest joy and honor for me. When I had entered the splendid Issavi, I had been but a girl from beyond the desert. But now I held gold and jewellery, house and garden, husband and children, and I was even to be granted the divine honors. And I became a priestess in the eyes of Suon. Oh, how could I have guessed that I had become a servant of the Benevolent King in the darkest of hours? For Suon's Wrath was already upon the venerable city Nuur, the capital of Kilmaresh was destined to fall. The wisest and most erudite priests came together, and I had the undeserved honor of being called into this high circle. Since many days and nights we are praying now. The suns sank in the west and rose in the east, many times already, without seeing Issavi safe. But today Suon sent us a portent. Tomorrow will see the fate of Kilmaresh. Only my few sisters and brothers stand with me between life and death.
