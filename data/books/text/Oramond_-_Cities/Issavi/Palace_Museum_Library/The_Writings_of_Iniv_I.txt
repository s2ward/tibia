The Writings of Iniv I.

And when I reached the gates of the city they praised in so many songs, I was covered in dust, emaciated by the desert's heat and at the end of my tether. I had escaped death and destruction and the horror that Fafnar's followers had brought upon us. I struck against the golden gates and shouted: "O people of the great and mighty Issavi, let me enter the green paradise in the heart of the steppe! My dusty feet are unworthy to touch the white alabaster of your streets. Nor are my lips worthy to taste the sweet water of your wells. Yet behold, I am just a girl from beyond the desert, without fortune, without parents, without house, without husband and children, without jewelery or divine honors. Without the smallest piece of silver, without the most modest ring on the toes of my feet, I come to the gates of the Golden City. But even though I don't hold any riches, I am rich in spirit. I know the glyphs and the old songs, I know the legends of the Anuma and the secrets of Aankhef Mhenet. Just give me papyrus and reed and I want to serve you and your glorious city as well as the spice merchants from beyond the saffron coasts."
