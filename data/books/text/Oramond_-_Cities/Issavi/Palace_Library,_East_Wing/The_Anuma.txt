The Anuma
The magical Anuma are mainly benevolent towards the humans but the wild manticores can also pose a threat. After the catastrophe the humans brought over the old empire and the crushing of the continent by Suon, the Anuma took over the reign of Kilmaresh. They want to prevent the humans from foolishly causing a disaster again. However, the humans are not oppressed but rather seen as a group that needs to be protected and guided. The Anuma see themselves as the humans' mentors and patrons and treat them a bit like parents would treat their children. As long as the humans do not make political, military or religious decisions that the Anuma disagree with, they will not intervene and let people go about their business undisturbed.
