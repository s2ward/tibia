Suon, the Benevolent King.
Suon is a kind and gracious god, a son of Fardos and also called the Life-Bringing Sun. Unlike his sister Fafnar he observes creation with love and blesses all creatures with warmth and growth. The worship of Suon and Bastesh grants Kilmaresh the stability and growth that the empire needs to prosper and flourish.
