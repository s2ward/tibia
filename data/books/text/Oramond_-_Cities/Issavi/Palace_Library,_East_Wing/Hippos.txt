On Hippos
Hippos are large, mostly herbivorous mammals who live semiaquatic in the river Nykri in Kilmaresh. The large animals have stocky, nearly hairless bodies and wide-opening mouths revealing large canine tusks. The territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river and groups of several females and young. Despite their rather cute appearance, hippos are among the most dangerous animals of Kilmaresh as they are highly aggressive and unpredictable. Yet, they love balls made of reed flour and appreciate to be fed with those treats.
