Fafnar, the Wild Sun
Fafnar is the wild and relentless daughter of Fardos and also called the Smiter or the Scorching Sun. Unlike her brother Suon, she observes creation with hate and jealousy. Her worhip is forbidden in Kilmaresh since the downfall of the old empire as her followers once caused a religious civil war that led to the old empire's destruction. But the cult of Fafnar secretly survived and the cultists still plague the new empire. They cause plenty of trouble in Issavi and in all of Kilmaresh.
