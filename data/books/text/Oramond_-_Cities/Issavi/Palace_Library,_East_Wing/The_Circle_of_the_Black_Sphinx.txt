The Circle of the Black Sphinx
This group is a dark mage circle that apparently has expanded to other continents long ago. It has strong necromantic tendencies and seems to be in contact with Fafnar cultists, from whom the circle has received undead gladiators. The "Black Sphinx" was a powerful yet evil sphinx, cast out by the rest of the Anuma.
