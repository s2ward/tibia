Bastesh, the Keeper of Wisdom
She Who Knows is the patron of the oceans and sea creatures. Bastesh, the calm and mystical daughter of Uman and Sula, is also called The Mistress of the Sea. She was once attacked by the wild Fafnar, out of jealousy and pride. After the religious war between the worshippers of Suon and Fafnar, Kilmaresh adopted the world view that Suon's true sister isn't Fafnar but Bastesh. So the people startetd worshipping her instead of the Wild Sun. Thus, Bastesh has a firm place in Kilmaresh's religious life since more than thousand years.
