The Fall of the Moon Goddess

Since the beginning of our existence, we have worshiped the moon goddess Amati. She always stood high in the sky, looking down on us benevolently and lighting up the nights. Although we love the warmth of the sun, it is the moon that moves the sea, creating the tides. It is the moon that can charge solid water with energy. That strengthens our magical powers. We think of the moon as a queen and the stars as her many maids. But once, in her wanderings across the night sky, Amati took a misstep and fell. She plummeted down, right above Marapur and landed in the Stardance Mountains. Hurt and alone, she didn't know how to get back up into the sky. And the stars missed her bitterly. Moon and stars shed many tears and mourned many nights - dark nights, without Amati's light in the sky. But then the stars decided to do something they had never done before: they descended from the sky and surrounded the fallen moon. They began a magical dance. And lo and behold, Amati was healed and, with the help of the stars, she was able to rise into the sky again. This is why the mountains in the center of Marapur are called the Stardance Mountains and our city here Moonfall. For it was at this very spot that Amati had fallen.
