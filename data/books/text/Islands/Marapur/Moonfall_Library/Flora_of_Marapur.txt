Flora of Marapur

Besides smaller water lilies that form waterways between buildings and islands, giant water lilies are also very common in Marapur. The lily pads grow several feet in diameter and are sturdy and thick enough to support smaller structures made of light wood along with several nagas. Those lily pads house shelters that are used for fishing, but also small shrines.

Starleaf never occurred naturally, but was specially cultivated as a source of food but also as craft material. It is grown on large farms, the leaves and buds harvested regularly.

The coral vow flower is a very rare plant, growing only in the mountains of the Murmuring Wilderness. Legend has it that the very first coral vow flower grew out of a foam stalker's spume. Yet, it was not an ordinary one but an older and more awe-inspiring specimen, a so called venerable foam stalker.
