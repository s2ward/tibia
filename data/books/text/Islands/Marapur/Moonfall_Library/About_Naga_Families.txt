About naga families, a treatise by Ziyad

Nagas do not know family in the sense how humans and many other peoples define it. Female naga lay eggs, but they do not take care of them themselves. Instead, they give them to larger nests for breeding. There, brood helpers take care of the eggs and also of the small nagas when they hatch. Nagas become independent quite quickly and reach the stage of a somewhat six-year-old human child after only one year. Then they are sent back to their parents, who take care of their education - or to one of the parents in case they are no longer in a relationship. Which happens quite often, because nagas rarely form longer, monogamous relationships. Hence, I assume, the displeasure about the intended marriage of Candra and Nihaka, which by many is dismissed as the crazy idea of two teenagers - and with someone from the "other" culture at that.
Another interesting fact about nagas is, that they sleep either in large, padded round baskets or by curling their snake bodies around thick branches. These very different ways of sleeping can be a source of discussion among naga couples when "branch sleepers" meet "basket sleepers".
