Magic and Solid Water

Spells are cast through gestures, called yukti. The more gestures a naga masters, the more spells they can cast. While many nagas can only perform yukti with two arms at the same time, some are able to form these gestures with three or even all four hands simultaneously. They are more powerful because they can combine more yukti at the same time to cast more powerful spells.

The solid water is a secret only known to the naga. It has roundish, organic shapes, like waves that have solidified in motion. It can also take the appearance of large drops or water bubbles. The solid water is very receptive to magical energy and therefore often enchanted. In the past, at the beginning of the Rising, these elements were mainly used to push back the water by casting repulsion spells on them. For now, they are used for a wide variety of purposes, partly to direct and guide water and to collect it in certain places, but also for entirely different purposes. And sometimes the solid water is only used for aesthetic decoration.
