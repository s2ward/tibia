How to light marsh paths

Especially in flooded areas, paths can be easily lit with marsh gas lamps. Through the hollow stem, the flammable marsh gases are conducted into the lamp head, and the flames ignited this way are continuously fed by this gas, almost never going out. These lamps can be driven into the ground so deep that the stem is pushed right into a gas bubble or gas vein in the marshy ground.
