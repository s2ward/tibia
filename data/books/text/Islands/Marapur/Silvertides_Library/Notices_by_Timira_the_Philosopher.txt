In coast folk society, there are many activities that are directly related to the Rising or have emerged from the way of life adapted to water. For example, there are the tide sages. They know everything about the tidal currents and can reliably predict when it is safe to navigate the sea with the small naga boats. They know when schools of fish come close to the coasts, making it a good time for fish. And they can estimate which islands will be affected by the Rising soon. The wave shapers are a kind of water-magicians who can create solid water, charge it with magic and also transform it into other forms. They have a sort of water-empathy that allows them to solidify the water and then shape it as if it were soft wax. Another profession is that of beaver whisperers. The nagas use the island's giant beavers as beasts of burden to transport timbers, star leaf and other material. These beavers are taken care of by the beaver whisperers, who build a trusting relationship with the animals and thus get them to work for the nagas.
