Tactics handbook - Use training to your advantage. Avoid fighting more than one enemy at once. Be careful while chasing an enemy, you might get hurt by his allies or other monsters and can't defend yourself while trageting him.
Target only the closest enemy, or you'll become confused and might not be able to defend yourself against other attacks.
Different enemies require different tactics. While some are best to be fought in an agressive way, you should encounter others in a defensive way. Choosing between your attack styles also depends from your equipment -  if you have only little defense at your disposal, there is likely no point in fighting defensively and vice versa.
