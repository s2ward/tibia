The cities of the continent:
Fibula is a small village on an isle southwest of the mainland. Its under the rulership of the Thais monarchy. Its rumored that beneath this isle are caves and dungeons of unknown but certainly ancient origin.
On the mainland is the city of Thais, ruled by the wise and just King Tibianus. His explorers found the new soulvortex on this isle and build this base to protect and train the incoming heroes.
In the far northwest is the city of Carlin, that is ruled by amazons. The stuborn so called queen refuses to accept the rulership of the Thais monarchy over the whole continent.
At the great bay, east of Thais lies a rotten town of criminals. Little is known about it and only the most ruthles people even think about travelling there.
The dwarfen town, north of mount sternum, the central tibian mountainmassive, is the home of the tibian dwarfs. If you are looking for smiths of unparraleled skill you should travel there.
Farer north, at the northern shores you find the elven city of Ab'Dendriel.There live the elves, masters of nature and masterhunters.
