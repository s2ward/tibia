Tibia's Renewal BOOK ONE
The heroic powers were just about to seal the defeat of the darkness by steel and manapower but the wars had persisted for too a long time. The world was fragile, the boundaries between the worlds cracked by the enormous powers, which had been employed. Already the armies of the older races were readying themselves to recapture from the humans what the old ones regarded as theirs. Already the children of the darkness, hardly troubled by the undead, risen again to new powers, were waiting to spread chaos over the world. Already the dragons sharpened their talons on their rock, in order to rise again into air to devastate the world in a fiery nightmare. Already the victorious armies of humans threw possessive looks on new targets. Already the daemons hammered on the walls of their breakable prison.
