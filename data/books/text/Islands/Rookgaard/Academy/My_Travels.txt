My travels.
As the orcs approached I've hidden myself in the bushes near the lake. I did hardly dare to breath as they met only some inches from my nose. I thought my wild beating heart might betray me to this murderous beasts. I overheared the greenskined brutes. 'charach' (or so) one said and the other responded the same way, then they began to chat in their strange language, certainly talking about some gruesome plot against mankind. Talking they wandered away and after they vanished from my view I quickly got up and headed to Thais as fast as I could.
