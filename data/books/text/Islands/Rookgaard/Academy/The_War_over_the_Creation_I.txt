The War over the Creation BOOK ONE
Uman was distressed by the actions of his dark side, and he asked Fardos to help him with his attempt to separate from his bad side. For a long time they manipulated and pulled on the essence of Uman-Zathroth, but only to detect that this unitity was destined for eternity. But a small part of Uman-Zatroth, a godly fragment separated itself due to this pulling and strugglig, and it assumed the shape of Kirok, which one would call the crazy one. Kirok was from precipitous, scizophrenic nature. On the one hand he was brilliant and creative, on the other hand one he was ludicrous and full of folly. Thus Kirok became the protection patron of the scientists on the one hand, and the jesters and jokers on the other hand.
Meanwhile the gruesome children of the dark gods raged more and more savagely,and the devastation of the world continued without cessation. Some of the other gods did not want to witness anymore, how their creation was troubled and subjected by the creatures after the spirit of Zathroth, and some decided to do something about that. Crunor created the wolves in order to protect his forests against the orcs, but these were too numerous! Only in the deepest forests and in wild herds the wolves learned to defeat their bipedal opponents.
