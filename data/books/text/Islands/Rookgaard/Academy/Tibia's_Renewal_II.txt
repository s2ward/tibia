Tibia's Renewal BOOK TWO
There the Gods on both sides stopped. They looked down upon the desintegrating world, and they decided an armistice, because they all wanted power over the creation, not its complete destruction. Thus the Gods threw the charm of the new beginning over the world! Only gradually the recovering sections of the old world started to rise from the nebulas of time, awakened the old races and old frights back to life. It is said that the city of Tibia was the first to rise again, barren of almost all life, without all magic, on a tiny island, deserted and almost devoid of life ... and nevertheless full of age-old secrets. And soon
afterwards life returned to the world. Also via the portal of souls old and new heroes found their way to Tibia. Gradually larger sections of the old world emerged from the nebulas, further natures and miracles. But the world is still far from its former splendour and size, and we live in times of change. What today is still natural, may as soon as tomorrow be only a legend, what today is still fantasy, may already tomorrow be reality. But hear ye and listen: Bad spirits also arrived and still arrive by the portal in our realm, in order to do mischief in human shape. Thus one has to face many dangers, and often the world appears to be cruel and hostile.
