The War over the Creation BOOK FOUR
The good Gods created and threw race after race into the struggle about the world. All of them were defeated! Almost everyone of the old races, which we know only as the Ancients, was defeated and buried by the sands of the time, because they were no match to the aggressive rage and the emotionless intrepidity of their opponents. According to our knowledge, only the delicate elves in their cities deep in the forests and the dwarves in their fortresses deep under the mountains survived the corpse wars, although at some campfires rumors are spread about other races, created by both sides for this unholy war, and of which some individuals are said to still be around. Just as strong and powerful as these peoples were, they were one-sided and of little flexibility. Worse still: Some creatures succumbed to the temptations of Zathroth about power and great knowledge. They switched sides, and rumor has it that the most powerful of the Ancients were hurled out of this world by the good Gods for their betrayal to suffer eternally in the sphere, which was created in order to punish them for their misdeeds, and changed to what nowadays is called the daemons. All their magic, which was probably given to the old peoples in excess, could not make them victorious, and they and their buildings disappeared gradually from the face of Tibia.
