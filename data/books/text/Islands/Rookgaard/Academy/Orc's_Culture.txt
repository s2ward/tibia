Orcs ARE intelligent. Though some dwarfs mumble about a shared hivemind of the greenskins, there is no evidence for that. Orcs have speech and are capable of learning other humanoids language quite well... if they want, what almost never is the case. They lack a written language though. Some of the more educated orcs use human letters to write down orcish texts. It's rumored that the orcs we encounter now and then are just barbarians of their own kind and that there is a more 'civilized' orcish culture somewhere. There are some clues that the orcs indeed had a written language, but the modern orcs are unable to read it as we are.
