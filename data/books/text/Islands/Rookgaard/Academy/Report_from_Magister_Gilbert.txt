Report from Magister Gilbert

Test lessons with young students have shown that it is not wise to start teaching magic under the age of 8. Results of magic lessons were that everyone ran around giggling, turning each other into frogs or worse. I strongly advise to start at a later age and with a harmless spell, such as light magic or healing magic.
Potions can be handed out. There have been no reported cases of overdose.
