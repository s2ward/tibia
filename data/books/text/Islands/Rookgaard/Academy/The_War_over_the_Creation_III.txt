The War over the Creation BOOK THREE
But on the other hand, many dragons fell due to the onslaught of the enormous hordes of orcs and their allies. Until today none of the old peoples has recovered from the great war. Tibia was completely scattered with the corpses of the great battle,and all life threatened to be suffocated thereby. There the gods decided that Uman should unite with the earth in order to create a godly being, which would take care of the dead. But Zathroth used a deception and appeared to the earth as its other side,Uman, and conceived in his place a being. This was the birth of Urgith, the master of the undead. And immediately the dead ones began to raise themselves on his calling, and they all were his creatures. Like the orcs before them, now the undead covered the body of the mother Tibia, and his children, the rats, were Urgith's messengers and scouts. Then however Uman and Tibia united, as it had been agreed upon, and Toth was born. Toth became the guardian of the dead ones and sent his large worms which began to devour the undead. For a long time the struggle lasted and again no end was to be foreseen.
