May the mirror guide you. May its reflection bind the power of the righteous to lead the way to the sanctity of the sacred. May its shining light be your salvation.
(The following note has been scribbled under the cryptic text:)
Some of the mirrors broke, I do not know which one of you was responsible for that but I altered the mechanism. The mirror's aren't even needed anymore to get the light on its way.
