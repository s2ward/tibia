I have to hide that key better. One of that greedy adventurers that came here seemingly out of nowhere and refused to tell me how he got here stole it and disturbed the contemplation of the brothers upstairs. Gladly they could defeat him. When will those people learn some respect. How could they think there would be anything valuable? The next intruders will pay a bitter price for such an act of evil!
