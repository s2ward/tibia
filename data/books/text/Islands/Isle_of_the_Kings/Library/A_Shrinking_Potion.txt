A shrinking potion
Take 2 powder herbs, a stone herb and a orange star. Cut them into small pieces and put them in a pot. Add a bottle of snake blood and boil it.
If you've done it right, the potion should be thick.
Wait until it's cold and then add the last ingredience, a 2 inch piece of a swamp plant.
This should make the potion green and much thinner. Fill it up in bottles and it's ready to be used
