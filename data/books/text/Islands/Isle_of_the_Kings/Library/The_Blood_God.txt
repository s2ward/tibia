The blood god
The god wars had reached levels unimaginable before in the history of the gods. The battlefield was a gruesome sight to behold, with blood and gore spilling everywhere. All the carnage and killing gave rise to an entirely new entity. An entity bound to the blood and suffering that the war brought forth. The fury of the war was so intense that the entity rivaled any god in power.
When the gods became aware of its existence the war came to a halt. The existence of the newly created blood god left them startled and horrified. With disgust they looked upon the newly created blood god, which was a blasphemous competitor, an abomination and anathema to them. For once their quarrels were put aside and in unison they struck against this blasphemous competitor. The combined might of the gods was unparalleled, and they unleashed their fury upon the blood god. They tore the entity apart and stripped away any godly essence it might have possessed.
In their fury the gods left nothing of the blood god and only splinters and shreds remained.
