The splinters
The most powerful splinter, representing the blood was whisked away by the followers of the blood god and forged into a powerful artefact whose traces have been lost in time though.
The other splinters, left alone festered and evolved. They grew in potency and acquired sentience, contained an echo of the memory of the dark god which spawned them.
Looking for a suitable host the corruptive powers sought out the most potential creatures that they could get a hold on. They found it in the form of some ancient dragons, whom they lured into an unholy alliance with promises of power and true immortality. They nested in the dragons and over time twisted their forms and minds. Promised to become the rulers of everything they became mindless slaves to the powers that inhabited them.
Some lesser splinters found their way into the hearts of powerful sorcerers, twisting their magic and turning them into dark mages. Others found their way into the hands of ruthless warlords, who used the splinter's power to conquer and subjugate entire nations. Rumor has it, that those splinters were gathered by unknown forces and forged into a powerful artefact.
