The Manasphere
by Rail Ashkil
The whole planet is surrounded by an energetic field called "Manasphere", produced  by "Mother Nature". Nearly every living being is able to tap it and store a certain amount of this "mana". Even less beings are able to use this energy to produce light etc. In most cases the user will "cast a spell" - but only to concentrate on his natural abbility of mana-using. Some beings, dragons e.g., seem to use the mana more instinctively but nevertheless with great efficiency.
