Legends that predate the rise of humanity tell of a god of blood, revered by an ancient race of vampires. Supposedly the progenitor of their race, it became old and bloated, only fed by its offspring through sacrifices.
In the god wars, its reverence reached a high, as all the blood from the countless battles could be used to feed it. It grew immensely in size and power, eventually bursting out of its hideout and crawling over the battlefields, devouring and consuming the fallen and wounded alike. As the battles raged, the god of blood was widely ignored by the warring parties. Eventually, the creature became so bloated on blood and corpses that it could no longer sustain its form and just burst into disgusting remains that littered the entire world. These splinters infected other creatures and gave rise to new generations of vampires. However, these vampires are seen as abominations by the first pure and true vampires.
