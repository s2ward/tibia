In days long past, when the wars of the gods ravaged the land long before any human set foot on the world, there were races and civilisations that flourished and decayed. Long before even the bonelord civilisation reached its peak, only to begin its steady decline that lasts even until today, there was a race of beings such noble and peaceful that they withdrew from the world and turned away from the constant war. But the gods considered them as traitors to their cause and cursed the whole race, turning them into snow and ice. And sometimes in cold winter nights when the wind blows through heavy snowstorms, you can still hear their moaning.
