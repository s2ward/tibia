The Great Sea Serpents
The Sea Serpent is as huge as a house and can swallow a small ship in one bite. Its scales are almost impenetrable and its teeth, which are as big as a cyclops, are coated with a corrosive poison that will dissolve human flesh on touch. In their undersea lairs they hoard treasures that would make a dragons hoard look miserable.
