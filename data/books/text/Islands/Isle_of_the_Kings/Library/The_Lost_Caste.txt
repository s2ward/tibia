The lost caste by Iregarn
We could not confirm the extinction of the Chelabdil. On the other hand we found no living beeing in the area. We met strong orcish presence there. Some of the orcs we killed had elvish items on them so it might be possible that all of the so called Chelabdil were wiped out by the orcish hords. One proof more our way is the right one.
