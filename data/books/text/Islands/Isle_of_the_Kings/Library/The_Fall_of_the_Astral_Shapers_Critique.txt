The Fall of the Astral Shapers - A Comment
Again Tristem delivers us a half-baked compilation of half-truths. Just as with his former works, he omits sources for most facts. This means the reader can only rely on his words. Even worse, obvious speculations are presented hand in hand with the few verified historical facts without any distinction. He even goes so far to omit any historical facts that do not fit into his own theories.
If you like to read a book about fiction instead of solid facts, you might find his work entertaining. However, for everybody who is really interested in science, the lack of validity is simply underwhelming.
