Introduction of the War of Welcome
The War of Welcome took place near the southern bridge, that the humans call 'the dwarf bridge'. The southern territory was once inhabited by a mighty orcish tribe and the few dwarves brave enough to stick around the mountain were constantly being hasseled by these orcish people and some were enslaved by the vile orcs! To the Northwest lie Carlin, a place inhabited by humans who struggled for survival on their own and could not help the dwarves in this matter either. As time went by the dwarves who called for war against the orcis raiders grew in number and voice. They felt they had a right to reatake these lands from the orcish invaders.
