Trihd and the Dragon
Part 2
Dragon: This is my cave, you
should not be here!
Trihd: Well, ah, I was, in fact,
just leaving.  (when, in fact,
he was doing quite the
opposite, and took a few steps
further in)
Dragon: You should not take
what does not belong to you.
Trihd: Ah, wise advice indeed.
(another gold coin, another few
steps)
Dragon: Mmmmhfh... Crunch,
crunch.
Trihd: AHHH!! ARRRGGGg-hck--
At which point the dragon
politely wiped his jaws clean
and replaced his gold coins, just
inside the entrance, and then a
bit further in.
