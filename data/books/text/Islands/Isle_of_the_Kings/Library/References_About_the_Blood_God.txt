The references to a prehistoric blood god, left over by the elder races are numerous and diverse enough to verify it's existence to some extent. The power of said entity is disputable and the references to godhood might be exaggerated yet they can't be outright discarded. The entity might have been in existence before the god wars although most resources suggest the god wars were the cause of its existence. It seems likely that, whatever its origin was, it gained significant amount of power due to the god wars. Several sources link this rise of power to the bloodshed in the countless battles of those times. At some point this power leads to the entities downfall though, specifics get a bit more sketchy here. The actual reason and circumstances of it's demise are more then uncertain yet most sources agree that the entity left some kind of legacy, be it in the form of a secret blood cult or in the form of some residue that contained fragments of its power. Most sources link the entity to the origin of vampires or at least identity vampiric creatures as it's followers. The few modern vampires that could be interrogated in that matter claimed ignorance of this history though.
