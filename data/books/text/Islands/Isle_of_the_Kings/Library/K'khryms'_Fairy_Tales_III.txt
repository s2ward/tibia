Trihd and the Dragon
Part 1
Once upon a time, in a land far,
far away, there lived a young boy.
This young boy loved to wander
about the countryside, day and
night.  He was what you might
(if you were so inclined to make
judgements on others) call
"curious".
One day, he happened upon a not
overly small opening in the
rocky side of a hill.  Under
Normal circumstances, he would
not have even thought about
wandering into such a dark place,
but as luck (or perhaps, in
spite of luck) would have it,
there was a gold coin lying in
the entrance, and another a few
steps inside.
So upon retrieving the first coin
he heard a booming voice from
further within the cave,  and the
conversation that ensued was
something like this:
Dragon (for it was a dragon in the
cave): Who goes there?
Trihd: I do. (at this point he
takes a few more steps inside
and retrieves the next gold coin,
and spots several more further in)
