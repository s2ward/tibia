The flying Venorean is a ship that is cursed to sail the seas forever. Allowed to visit land only every seven years, the ghostly captain uses his shore leave to lure clueless sailors into his crew. Everybody that signs the contract becomes cursed like the captain and might only leave the ship if he finds a suitable exchange on one of his shore leaves every seven years.
