Three pirate kings of old made a pact with the powers of darkness and were rewarded with three dark blades of immense powers. No enemy survived an attack with one of these blades. It is said that they allowed their owners to know whenever other ships where near and that storms and wind could be called with the blades to assist in the evil plots of the pirates.
The end came on the day these pirates decided to betray each other.
In a sea battle, they called for storms of such intensity that all of their ships sank. None of the pirates survived, and the blades vanished.
It is assumed they lie on the ocean floor.
