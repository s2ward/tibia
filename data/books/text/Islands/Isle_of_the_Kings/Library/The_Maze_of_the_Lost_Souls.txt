The maze of the lost souls
Centuries ago, our ancients build this maze to protect our city Demona from bandits and warriors.
With the help of our loyal trolls they finished this giant maze within 1 month!
This maze has been protecting us for centuries and we hope that it will be the same for many following centuries too.
