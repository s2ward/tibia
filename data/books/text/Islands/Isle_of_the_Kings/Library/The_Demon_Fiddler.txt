The Demon Fiddler
A legend tells about a man, a sinister traveller that booked a passage on a ship. 
In a stormy night he began to play a ghostly tune on his fiddle. The tune drove
the helpless sailors into madness and forced them to sail their ship laughing on the next reef. The traveller though had vanished.
