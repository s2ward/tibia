In the times of the god wars a blasphemous creature, an amalgam of carnage and madness arose from the blood soaked battlefields. It was a gigantic, self-aware blood golem, created by the magical powers used in the war, fused with the souls and suffering of the fallen. In it's madness the creature claimed godhood for itself and roamed the world, subjugating followers and devouring those who would not yield to its will. Its delusions of grandeur were such intense that it's hunger and arrogance stopped for no one. So at some point it and its followers came upon a great, pitched battle of the forces of good and evil.
In it's madness the self proclaimed god and his followers attacked the warring parties. The blood thing planned to devour them all as it had done countless times before. Yet the armies brought their battle to a hold and accessing the situations the commanders decided to join forces. In unison they struck against the army of the blood god which was only prepared to strike at confused enemies, fighting each other. Soon the blood army was scattered and in retreat. The blood creature, sensing the danger took flight too but the enemies did persist.
