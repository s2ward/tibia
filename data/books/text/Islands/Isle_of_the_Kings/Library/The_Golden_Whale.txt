Since sightings have been reported by many respectable seamen the
existance
of the golden whale can no longer be dismissed as a fairy tale. It is said that this whale is as huge as an isle and its body is made of purest gold. Even though many of the reports were made by seamen in the southern seas sailors of the north also claim to have seen this creature. All over the world the sighting of the golden whale is seen as a good omen. No one has yet been able to even hurt the beast; however, several inventors and mages have come up with ideas for the creation of a weapon that might pierce its golden body.
