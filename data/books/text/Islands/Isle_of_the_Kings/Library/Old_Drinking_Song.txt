Oh me hearties,
For simpler times
When nary a bridge in sight
And Thais, the town,
Was lit till dawn
By an eastern dragon's light
Oh me scallywags,
For better times
When treasure hunting wasn't so
tough
But then that vermin
Came into the depot
Killed me, and took all my stuff
Oh me fools
For newer days
All things come to an end
For let it be known
This world it has grown
But I still don't know who's my
friend
-Old Drinking Song
