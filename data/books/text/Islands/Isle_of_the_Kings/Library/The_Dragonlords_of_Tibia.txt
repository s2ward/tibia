The Dragonlords of Tibia
Written by Tekvorian, Knight of Tibia
We dont know much about the mighty leaders of the dragons. But we found out that they love mushrooms of all kind. Maybe the old dragonlord on Dracona can tell us more.
Furthermore, we found out that many Dragonlords carry a strange book with them. We dont know why,yet, but we are working on it.
