The Great Creation BOOK ONE
Uman in his wisdom recognized the possibilities, which revealed themselves to them here, and he asked Tibiasula join in the circle of the creators and help them with the task of the creation. Tibiasula agreed, because she also was fascinated by the idea of the creation.
Uman, whose nature was to win secrets and gain insights, had relized what their error at the receding attempts had been:
Without a fixed pivot point there was no existence possible, and everything had to diffuse away as it was without direction and target. And to remedy that he invented TIME!
In order to create the time, the Gods united their powers. Even Zathroth was fascinated by the idea of his other half and contributed a tiny proportion of his strength to the effort. The wise claim that it is to be due to his working that all time strives in the long run to decay and destruction. The powers of the godly bundled themselves to an enormous power greater than any in existence before. It began to crystallize itself in the void to an enormous spiral. Higher and higher it mounted up, became firmness, pivot point, direction andaim of existence! And in such a way the crystal column of time grew upwards and was from then on the unmovable center of creation.
