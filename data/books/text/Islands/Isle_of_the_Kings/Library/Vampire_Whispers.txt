The vampires whisper about a blood mother as their progenitor. A creature as old as the gods themselves, she was born from the blood of Zathroth's attack on Tibiasula. The blood goddess was shunned by the other gods for her origin but she was content to dwell in the darkness far away from the other gods and their struggles. When the god wars started and she witnessed all the carnage and mayhem, she sensed that she might become a target too despite her absence from godly affairs. So she prepared herself and used the blood that flowed in the countless battles of the god wars to amplify her strength. However, the newfound surge of power was overwhelming and too much for her to handle, yet she was unable to stop the consumption of power as long as the blood was flowing so freely.
In her despair, she pleaded to the gods for help. The gods stopped their struggles in a moment and passed their judgment upon her in the form of death. They struck down the blood mother and ripped her powers into pieces.
