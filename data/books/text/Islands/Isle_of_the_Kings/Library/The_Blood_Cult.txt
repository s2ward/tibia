The blood cult
The blood god's rise to power also brought about the birth of a blood cult, a circle of devout followers, a sect devoted to worshiping and serving their deity. The cult's roots were steeped in darkness and their practices were macabre and gruesome. The blood god flourished. The first inhuman vampire spawn were his creations. The vampire priests served as his heralds and prophets and gathered a flock of devout followers, lured into their folds by promises of immortality and power. The inner circle of his priesthood was taught the darkest secrets of the blood. They learned forbidden things that were even unknown to the gods themselves. The truths they learned opened their minds to the true powers of their vampiric forms and elevated them far above their kin. Their splendor and power lured in more and more subjects, willing to undergo the transformation, yet only the most worthy were chosen.
This neglect leads to envy though and one of the most powerful among the scorned betrayed the cult and gave away their secrets to their enemies. Yet they were afraid of the might of the blood priests and only when the gods struck down the god of blood they dared to strike on their own, attacking the confused priests and their followers. They routed out all they could find and brought a cruel end to their existence, which otherwise would have hardened the test of time.
