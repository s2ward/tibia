Forfer and his Fish
Part 1
Once upon a time, in a land far,
far away,  lived a young swamp
troll named Forfer.  He lived in
his moss covered cave right
beside a beautiful river,  and
every day, he would catch fish,
eat fish, play in the mud, and
catch and eat some more fish, in
that order.  His was a happy life,
though he always felt that
something was missing.
Then one day, while playing in
the mud on the edge of the swamp,
he caught a glimpse of something
that seemed quite out of place-
a red something, just over the
top of the nearest hill.  He
gathered his fish and went to
investigate,  and there, to his
great surprise,  he discovered a
beautiful house, with a bright red
roof, and complete with a spry
young man splitting wood on the
front lawn.  This is what I am
missing!  He thought, and walked
slowly up to the man (as it is not
wise to run up to a man carrying an
axe, especially if you're already
a swamp troll.)
But the man did not appear alarmed,
and invited Forfer into his
beautiful red-roofed house for some
cookies.  Forfer happily obliged,
and they struck up a conversation
about houses and fish.  The man
expressed his great desire to eat
something other than cookies,  but
with all his wood-chopping, he had
not yet had time to go and get any
more food for himself.
