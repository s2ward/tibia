Kazordoon, the hidden city
In the blocklike Mountain, known as the big old one, the hidden city of kazordoon is nestled. Its the last refuge of the ancient race of dwarves. Hidden and heavily fortified it was the last stand of dwarvenhood in the wars of creation and the last hope of that race to adapt to and survive the new ages. The famous giant statue, known as colossus guards its entry, alhough the narrow valley makes it difficult to see that fortress-statue and admire its beauty. Kazordoon is known for its safety and masterful smithery throughout the lands.
Since some generations the dwarven city (whose ruler claims a title that might be translated as 'emperor') is allied with the thaian kingdom.
