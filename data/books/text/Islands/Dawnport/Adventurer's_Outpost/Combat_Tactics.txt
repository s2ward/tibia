Combat Tactics
Most monsters are far more dangerous when you're attacked by more of them. Keep in mind that no more than two enemy attacks can be blocked at a time. Use this to your advantage and attack single monsters with help of other heroes. Don't get surrounded by monsters - that might be your death even if the monsters are not that powerful.
