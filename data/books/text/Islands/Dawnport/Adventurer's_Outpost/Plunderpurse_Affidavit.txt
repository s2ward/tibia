This is written proof that Captain Plunderpurse gave away all the cursed gold to the little kiddies, bless his generous heart. No torture, extortion, cut off limbs, manipulation or embezzlement at all was involved in my testimony, I swear! And I am very thankful not to make the acquaintance of the Captain's pet sharks, lovely beasts though they are. Signed, Triomon Tangleweed, certifying notary.
