The goblins stole my backpack and clothes when I slept, and left me here without even a rope or shovel. I don't know how long I will have before I starve. My only hope is that some adventurer comes down here and saves me, but my throat is sore from shouting for help. So I am writing this down in my own blood in the hopes of it being found to serve at least as a warning when I am dead. I know they have some kind of den further on, but I am too weak to investigate. I hear songs and rattle of glass; I believe they are drinking the provisions they stole from the ship, those greedy little magpies! You who read this, beware. Those green pests steal everything.
