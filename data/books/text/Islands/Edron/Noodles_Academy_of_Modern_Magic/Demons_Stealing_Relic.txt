The demon boasted about the exploits he achieved in his life which already lasted a few millennia. Though most of it is probably nothing more than shameless exaggeration and outright lies, there may be some truth behind some of those stories. In particular, he insisted to have fought and defeated a race 'far better and noble' than us humans ages ago. I was able to provoke him to reveal some more information on that issue. In the end it seems a group of demons found some race that had taken refuge from the wars of the gods in some remote place. Several times, the demons attacked that race to steal some powerful relic or something like that from them. In the end the refugees or the force of the demon attack destroyed that item which resulted in a disaster in which the race and also most of the demons were wiped out.
