Misleading Myths
The veiled hoard of Zathroth is obviously only a myth. Ancient sages used it as an allegory to a certain state of mind. To reach the hoard is to unify the greatest and most complex secrets of the world. It means to understand them in such a natural way they can be weaved into a universal pattern that allows understanding the inner workings of the world. This would be an amount of knowledge that could only be called 'godly'. Of course no mortal being could reach such a level of understanding. The followers of this path strife for it nonetheless. This knowledge is by definition only limited, a mere stepping stone to the next level of understanding on a never ending staircase. The assumption that a hoard would actually need a physical representation of knowledge on the other hand, seems rather blasphemous. Why would a god need books and why would a god of secret knowledge risk to accumulate all forbidden knowledge at one place I ask? The story about Zathroth's hoard of knowledge is just that, a story. Everything else is a ridiculous theory of past days of unenlightenment.
