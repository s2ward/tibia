Knightly Successor Orders of Tibia, loose pages III
According to the last official records of the whereabouts of several old orders, Kesar Etzel may have been a driving force behind the falling out of several old orders with King Xenom. Reportedly he not only had a dispute with the King, he also fell out with the leader of the Order of the Falcon, Oberon, over how to guide the now exiled orders into a righteous future. While Kesar wanted to protect the known world from dark forces, Oberon was determined to explore foreign lands and discover more of the world, the knights swore to give their lives for. Traveling into the unknown and uncovering evil whereever its roots may be, was a prime goal for Oberon and the Order of the Falcon. Oberon was stubborn and impossible to control, even for his elder brother. Their sister Scarlett would not have any of this and neglected both her brothers ways. She had confidence in her knights, especially her strategist and loyal companion Galthen and wanted to go her own way after leaving Edron. Yet even she would have liked to see Kesar and Oberon to burry their differences and instead join in their endeavours. A consent was never reached, Kesar was the first to leave Edron and King Xenom behind. He avoided Oberon but remained in contact with Scarlett for a few years.
