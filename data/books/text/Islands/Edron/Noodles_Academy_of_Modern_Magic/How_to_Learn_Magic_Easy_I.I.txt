How to learn magic easily. Level 1: For Knights and non-Vocation people (Part one)
Magic is life, life is magic. Well, life is sex too, but this is a book for little children, so we won't talk about that here. But never forget that magic is a jealous lady, and if you try to get her out of your head she will be sure to take revenge.
The first thing you must know about the Noble Art of Magic is that not all Tibian inhabitants or monsters of the underworld have the exact same way with magic. Only the civilised people who live on this world have the same magic style, no matter their race: humans, the elves in Ab'Dendriel the Beautiful and even the dwarfs in their underearth city, Kazordoon. There is only one spot that is completely isolated from magic in the whole world, and that is the island known as Rookgaard, where no magic can be cast - perhaps some Dark Ritual made it impossible, who knows.
In the civilised world, not all have the same skill with or amount of magic power, commonly known as 'mana', but this will be explained in the next book.
