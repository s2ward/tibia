This page seems to be part of a book about ancient rituals, mystic incantations and far away places. Besides a very prominent symbol, embedded in the text, a spell can be deciphered from the strange script:
~ As daylight fades, mix chalk or bone meal with your own blood and water ~
~ Draw with it a circle in the middle of the room ~
~ Stand in this sphere when drawing the symbol "Of Night And Day Intersecting Ostensum Est"
~ Utter all of the following words loudly with clear voice: CERTAGIA SALABANTHR DANNHE GENT'HO" ~
~ Looking upward, repeat the incatation and you shall teleport the periphery of your body ~
