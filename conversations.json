They\u2019re quite impressive. You need such a sceptre to show to one that you\u2019re its new master."}, {"Player": "Slingshot"}, {"Lothar": "That might be the only way to tame a bear.

Parts of the tome were obviously erased and later overwritten. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "In the parts of the original text that I was able to reconstruct with the help of some alchemy, there were some references to lizard spawns that were sighted in the Tiquanda area and linked to the snake god. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Admittedly, it is just a hypothesis that is based on a few hints in these tomes and my correspondence about serpent spawns with the sage Edowir\u2026 \u2026"}, {"Cael": "\u2026However, considering everything that I could figure out about their origin, they seem to hatch from the same eggs like ordinary lizardmen. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "It seems that some of those eggs are imbued with spiritual or magical power and as a result bear a serpent spawn. It appears that this changed when the dragon emperor became the ruler of this land. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Unlike serpent spawns, the draken hatched from some of the eggs in the hatcheries. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "I can only imagine what this might imply. As I said, it\u2019s only a theory, but I think a quite valid one and I\u2019d treasure any additional information about that topic. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "In the meantime, I\u2019ve also talked to Esrik about some information that I found in the tome concerning weaponry and armory. Knowing this dwarf, he might have some interesting offers for you by now."}, {"Player": "founder"}, {"Cael": "It seems that some parts of the tome are just copies from other sources and rather unrelated to each other. As far as I could piece them together, there was a mythical founder of the lizard civilisation. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "His name was Zao and his deeds and exploits are immortalised in lizard folklore. Some of the earliest records in the tomes suggest a slightly different story though. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Many records talk about an early lizard dynasty, but I doubt that Zao was a single person born into that dynasty. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "My guess is that several members of this dynasty are responsible for or connected to the feats that were attributed to the mythical \u2018Zao\u2019. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "The improbable lifespan of \u2018Zao\u2019 can thus be explained with the time the Zao dynasty reigned. On the other hand, we all know larger-than-life heroes did exist and some of them had an extremely long lifespan. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Most likely, he also had children which could explain the mentioning of a Zao family. I think even the lizardmen don\u2019t know for sure what happened in such distant past and so this might be one of those riddles that will never be solved. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "It seems that the origin of the Zao dynasty was somewhere in the Dragonblaze Peaks, or rather under them. Legends tell of a large fortress, once erected up the highest peak, but now buried deep underground. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll find answers there?"}, {"Player": "zzaion"}, {"Cael": "Have you ever seen the towers of the large lizard city south-east of Zao?

And this is not all! It\u2019s reported that everything that is growing in this land experienced a fertility decrease. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Even the lizards themselves seem to suffer from a population decline. It\u2019s widely blamed to a plague that ravaged the land in the past, but that seems unlikely given the fact that also plants and various animals were affected. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Additionally, several plants changed in shape and became poisonous or toxic. Also, some new-born lizards seem to be affected by this. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "According to the descriptions, I\u2019d call them mentally unstable, but their people see them as \u2018blessed by the dragon emperor\u2019. I assume there are strange forces at work in this land, and I have a bad feeling about it. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Anyway, you know what else was mentioned in this book? A path down to a hidden cave system below the Muggy Plains. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Apparently, at first this system was used to hide \u2013 or rather to get rid of \u2013 new-born lizards that carried the sign of corruption \u2013 before the lizards decided to view it as a blessing. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Who knows what happens down there now \u2013 maybe it\u2019s worth a look, maybe not. Maybe you won\u2019t even discover anything. In any case, be careful."}, {"Player": "dragons"}, {"Cael": "Dragons are of great symbolism for this land. Even before the dragons came here and took control over Zao, the lizards worshipped the dragons as strong mythical beasts. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "When the future dragon kings came here \u2013 seemingly from a distant and foreign land \u2013 they probably took some advantage of this cult. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Another symbol \u2013 that of the snake \u2013 that must have been much more popular than the dragon, faded into unimportance over the years. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "I think in the past, the lizardmen of this country might have worshipped a snake god or goddess just like their brethren in Tiquanda if we can believe the reports from this area. The dragons replaced the snake worship at some point of history. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "The reference to heretics and their extermination suggests that there might have been a rebellion against the dragons, which in turn hints at some close link between lizards and dragons, maybe a forced one. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "While reading this tome, I discovered a drawing of this beautiful statue. I was a skilled sculptor in the past, so I can\u2019t resist. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "I\u2019m probably not that good anymore, but if you\u2019re interested and find me a red lantern, I could make one of those for you."}, {"Player": "thrones"}, {"Cael": "In the modern lizard culture thrones seem to be only a reminiscent of the past. Whereas in the past the rulers of the lizardmen used thrones and other insignia to show their status, in our days they are ruled by dragon kings. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Those kings seem to be massive dragons of immense power. Of course they do not actually \u2018use\u2019 thrones anymore, but claim them nonetheless as symbol for their position. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "From what I can tell, the lizards are bound to those dragon kings by some kind of magic. I\u2019m not sure what this magic does, but I guess it ensures their loyalty to some extent. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "On an interesting side note \u2013 there were some hints in the tome that the dragon kings themselves are somehow bound to the dragon emperor through the same kind of magic. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "It seems this kind of liege system was formed sometime after the arrival of the dragons in this land. It\u2019s definitely an interesting field of research and shows us how much we still have to learn and to discover. \u2026"}, {"Cael": "Well, I\u2019ve certainly learnt how the great old thrones look like.

Our own people, lead by the Axe of Vengeance fellowship."}, {"Player": "Axe of Vengeance / Renegades"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "Well, the Axes of Vengeance were troublemakers even when they were few. Their reckless ways and boasting sadly impressed a lot of the young and easily gullible. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "Stories of their mostly made-up exploits and lies lured some into their embrace, but it was not until the blight that they became popular and a threat thanks to their leader, Jarok Bilespit."}, {"Player": "Jarok Bilespit"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "Well, Jarok Bilespit was a mercenary.

I admit we did not see this coming and let him spread his phrases in the city. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "We had other things to do and did not want more unrest by arresting some popular figure. With our attention elsewhere, Bilespit took advantage of the desperate and lured them into his ranks. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "He was never the subtle type though, so it became quite clear what unspeakable treason he planed. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "When he led his bunch of mercenaries and several drunks as some kind of meat-shield to dethrone me, we were prepared. We planned to take Bilespit down first to minimize casualties, but things got out of hand and there were many deaths on both sides. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "With the order to keep presumably innocent casualties low, my guards fought very restricted, which could have led to their losing the battle. So we had to change orders to reduce our own casualties, and the fight turned very bloody and nasty. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "Rumours spread through the city and others who thought they sympathized with Bilespit\u2019s cause joined the battles. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "Still, we tried to keep casualties low; and as soon as we took certain strategic positions and gained the upper hand, most of the rebellious forces escaped. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "Now they are hiding in the mine: Most of those mines are old and depleted of ore. They are overrun by all sorts of creatures such as the Lost. \u2026"}, {"Emperor Kruzak": "So it made not much sense to send in troops that could not efficiently use their numbers and combat training in brawls within winding and narrow tunnels.
